Case Study: - Assignment 1
Facebook Cambridge Analytica Scandal Submission due date: s
(7th February 2025 23:59hrs)
In 2018, it as discovered that face book had allowed the political consulting firm Cambridge 
Analytica to access the personal data of millions of users without their consent.
This raised ethical issues about the use of personal data and the responsibility of companies to 
protect users’ privacy.
Digital Forensics was used to investigate the data breach and determine the extent of damage.
Questions:
1. What  are some of the sensitive and personal data that may be collected during a digital 
Forensics Investigation?
2. How does Uganda's data privacy law address this type of case, and what rights does it grant to 
individuals? (Describe each of the rights in the context of the scenario mentioned above)
3. Discuss the role of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in addressing data privacy 
issues. How might the GDPR have influenced the outcome of the Cambridge Analytica case if it 
had been in effect at the time?

What is Digital Evidence?
Digital Evidence is defined as any type of file stored on a device, such as a text file, a document, an image 
or an executable file. 
It is any information of probative value that is either stored or transmitted in a digital form.
Locard’s Exchange principle states that everyone who enters and exits a crime scene leaves something of 
themselves behind.
