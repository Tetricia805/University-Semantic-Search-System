ABSTRACT 
This research study focused on investigating the optimum replacement of Basalt Rock 
powder (BRP) that can be used to partially replace cement as a cement supplementary 
material (SCM) while achieving the maximum suitable compressive strength. The Basalt 
rocks used in this study were collected and crushed from Mugarama site in Kibaale 
District to form powder. The physical and mechanical properties of concrete ingredient 
such as sand and coarse aggregates were determined and these included sieve analysis, 
ACV, AIV, moisture content, flakiness index, specific gravity and water absorption. The 
properties of the BRP were determined by carrying out different tests such as sieve 
analysis, x-ray fluorescence, water absorption with results provided in chapter 4 below. 
The control mix of a cement content 430Kg, fine aggregate, 675kg, water 206kg and 
coarse aggregate of 1007kg. The percentage replacement of cement with BRP varied 
from 0, 10,15,20,25 and 30%. Concrete cubes of sizes 150mmx150mmx150mm were 
casted and evaluated for 7 and 28 days. 
Increase in percentage replacement of cement with BRP showed an increase in 
compressive strength from 0% to 15% attaining the highest value of 43.9Mpa and then 
gradually decreased with increasing percentage replacement of BRP. The setting time 
decreases while workability increases, with an increase in BRP percentage 
replacement. The compressive strength, setting time and workability were all lying in 
the acceptable ranges according to literature, 43.9Mpa, 7.7hrs and 87mm respectively. 
The 15% is the optimum percentage replacement since its strength is well above the 
control concrete of 40.5Mpa, and target strength of 35.1Mpa.

CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Background 
Concrete is a man-made building substance that has been used for decades in the 
construction industry and is known to be the second most used substance on the planet, 
after water. Concrete is a mixture of majorly; coarse aggregates, sand, cement and 
water (Azad, 2019). 
Production of concrete is associated with lots of environmental concerns due to the 
over consumption of raw materials, energy and labor. Cement as one of the key 
ingredients in concrete, consumes a lot of energy during its production while still 
releasing about 0.55-0.94 tons of carbon dioxide emissions per ton, possessing about 7% 
of the world’s total carbon dioxide emissions (Li, 2022). Several researches have been 
carried out to find alternatives or supplements to cement in concrete, especially on 
natural pozzolans like fly ash, silica fume, blast furnace slag, volcanic pumice etc. Also, 
more research investigated agricultural waste like coconut, maize, rice, sugar cane and 
industrial by products like basalt rock powder, waste foundry sand etc as Supplementary 
Cementitious Materials (SCM) (Qiao, 2019). But with all these studies, there’s limited 
knowledge regarding the potential use of Basalt rock powder in concrete production, 
given that little have been investigated towards achieving the appropriate particle size 
and optimum percentage for partial cement replacement. 
Basalt rock is an igneous rock that covers about 30% of the Earth’s surface making it 
the most rock, therefore its volume is abundant as it is available in most continents. 
This igneous rock is a dark colored, fine grained, rock that forms as a result of volcanic 

2 
 
activity, when basaltic lava, the molten magma from the mantle, cools down. The dark 
color is due to the presence of the minerals such as plagioclase, pyroxene (augite), 
olivine with possible minor glass. Basalt rocks are largely found in various parts of 
Uganda including Mbale district, Kibaale district, Kisoro district etc, and can be 
identified by their black or grayish-black rock color, fine and even grain texture with 
no crystals or minerals discernible to the naked eye. 
Basalt rock has been used in the construction industry for various applications but 
majorly as aggregates due to its availability, sustainability, durability and strength 
properties (Qiao, 2019). Basalt rock powder (BRP) has a large specific surface area and 
high SiO2 and Al2O3 contents thus when used as a supplementary cementitious 
material, it can have a positive impact on the mechanical properties. This is because 
basalt rock powder forms a gel on hydration, when Calcium Oxide from Cement reacts 
with SiO2, resulting into nucleation of the C-S-H and strengthening the bond between 
basalt and the matrix (Li, 2022). This research will investigate the optimum percentage 
of Basalt Rock Powder that can be used to partially replace cement in concrete, to 
produce a high-performance concrete which is economical and environmentally 
sustainable. 
1.2 PROBLEM STATEMENT 
Cement production contributed to the release of about 2.3 gigatons of carbon dioxide 
in 2019, possessing about 7% of the world’s total carbon dioxide emissions. This is 
expected to reach 4.83 billion metric tons in 2030. A solution for decreasing the CO2 
emissions determined by the cement industry is its replacement by supplementary 
cementitious materials - SCMs, (Adrian, 2022). 

3 
 
As a result, cement is expensive both economically and environmentally, such that 
much research is being carried out to adopt more sustainable alternatives. A partial 
replacement of cement with basalt rock powder, will not only reduce cost in concrete 
production, decrease gas emissions leading to greenhouse effect, minimize harmful 
environmental impacts, reduce the consumption of natural resources and the energy 
but also improve the compressive strength of concrete (Qiao, 2019). 
A study shows that 10 to 25% basalt rock is appropriate for replacing Portland cement 
partially, while still another study indicates that the optimum ﬁne aggregate 
replacement is about 20–30% and it depends more on rock dust ﬁneness. So, there’s 
need to carry out a profound-research to establish the optimum ratio for partial 
replacement of cement in concrete with regard to the ﬁneness of the basalt rock 
powder. This will help to produce a high-performance concrete with improved strength 
properties, economically cheap and environmentally friendly. 
1.3 OBJECTIVES OF STUDY 
1.31 MAIN OBJECTIVE 
To investigate the use of Basalt Rock Powder in the Partial replacement of 
cement in concrete. 
1.3.2 SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES 
1. To determine the physical and mechanical properties of concrete aggregates 
2. To determine the physical properties and chemical composition of basalt rock 
powder 

4 
 
3. To determine the properties of fresh concrete at different proportions of 
basalt rock powder with cement. 
4. To determine the properties of hardened concrete at different proportions of 
basalt rock powder. 
1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS 
1. What are the physical and mechanical properties of the concrete aggregates? 
2. What are the physical properties and chemical composition of Basalt rock 
powder? 
3. How is the properties fresh concrete mixes at different proportions of basalt 
rock powder with cement determined? 
4. What is the properties of hardened concrete at different proportions of basalt 
rock powder determined? 
1.5 SCIENTIFIC JUSTIFICATION 
According to previous research, basalt rock powder is proven to have good durability, 
strength and resistance to wear and erosion, readily available at an economically 
sustainable cost and suitable for use in concrete (Qiao, 2019). Also, basalt can be 
utilized in its natural state depending on its grain size for cementitious composites, due 
to its influence as a pozzolanic active component (Scheinherrová, 2022) 
This study therefore investigates the partial replacement of cement with a natural 
pozzolanic material to improve the strength of concrete while providing a natural 
alternative for cement, thereby reducing carbon emission, energy consumption and 
natural resource depletion among others.

CHAPTER TWO: LITERATURE REVIEW 
2.0 INTRODUCTION 
This chapter provides theoretical literature review about basalt rock powder, its 
properties and its constituents and previous research about the use of basalt rock 
powder in concrete. This chapter also provides a critique of existing literature and 
identifying the research gap thus contributing to the scientific knowledge of the 
research. It also includes reviews on the research problem with reference to existing 
theories and studies in regards to the research topic. The part of Empirical literature 
review is also included which covers largely the studies carried out by different 
researchers about the use of basalt rock powder as a partial or full replacement of fine 
aggregates in conventional concrete in the construction industry. 
2.1 THEORETICAL REVIEW 
2.1.1 CONCRETE 
Type of concrete in our study is plain concrete which is the common, conventional 
concrete that contain the major ingredients; fine aggregates (sand), coarse aggregates 
(gravel), cement and water. Concrete is preferred for its ability to be easily molded 
into various structures and also having sufficient strength and structural properties 
highly regards its need in the construction environment now and the future to come, 
although it is not homogeneous (Narayanan, 2013). Due to advancement in technology 
and the need for a sustainable environment, there has been considerable discoveries 
and studies towards concrete to future exhaustion of concrete materials, carbon foot 
print, excessive energy usage and economic concerns. As a result, thorough research is 

7 
 
being undertaken of supplementary cementitious materials such as agricultural waste, 
mining waste, stone powders among others (Qiao, 2019). 
2.1.1.1 TYPES OF CONCRETE GRADES AND THEIR USES 
Concrete are graded depending on their strength and composition, since different 
grades are suitable for a different purpose and this strength is determined after the 28 
days of initial construction. The following are the most available concrete grades 
according to Warsaw, 2014; 
i. 
Concrete grade M10, mix ratio (design mixes) 1:3:6 and Strength of 10Mpa. This 
is used for constructing pathways and non-structural work 
ii. 
Concrete grade M15, mix ratio (design mixes) 1:2:4 and Strength of 15Mpa. This 
is used for constructing pavement kerbs and floor binding 
iii. 
Concrete grade M20, mix ratio (design mixes) 1:1.5:3 and Strength of 20Mpa, 
used for constructing domestic floors and foundations with light weight. It is also 
good for workshop bases, garages, driveways, internal floor slabs and low volume 
roads 
iv. 
Concrete grade M25, mix ratio (design mixes) 1:1:2 and Strength of 25Mpa, used 
for construction in all areas of multi-purpose concrete mix, usually in deep 
foundations 
v. 
Concrete grade M30, mix ratio (design mixes) 1:1:1 and Strength of 30Mpa. This 
is the most weather resistant grade and can take heavy road traffic. It is the 
lowest grade of concrete mix 
2.1.1.2 CONSTITUENTS OF CONCRETE 
Concrete is widely and extensively most used construction material in the works of civil 

8 
 
and construction World. Concrete is used in the construction field in foundation, 
constructing roads, making pavements, parking structures, overpasses, and block walls 
among others. 
Concrete as a material consists at least 75% of aggregate by volume and is obtained 
from a proportionate mixture of cement binder, sand, aggregates, and water. Sand, 
cement and water forms a paste which hardens as result of chemical reaction between 
the water and cement. The formed paste binds the aggregates together into a solid 
rock. The strength and durability of concrete is dependent on the properties of its 
ingredients, mix proportions, method of compaction with other factors and also control 
during placing, compaction and curing. 
The properties of concrete are divided into two; fresh concrete properties and harden 
concrete properties. 
Fresh concrete properties: These include workability, segregation and bleeding. To 
determine the workability of fresh concrete tests such as slump tests, compaction 
factor test and flow table test are carried out and this helps to determine the strength 
and durability of concrete. 
Harden concrete properties: various tests are carried out on hardened concrete to 
determine properties such as strength, durability, and permeability. Tests on hardened 
concrete such as compressive strength test, flexural strength test, tensile strength test, 
modulus of elasticity test are carried out to determine the strength properties of 
concrete

2.1.1.2.1 CEMENT 
This is a pulverized material produced by blending a mixture of lime containing 
materials and clay materials such that it exhibits adhesive and cohesive properties 
which make it capable of bonding mineral fragments into compact whole for use in 
building of structures. Ingredients such as lime (CaO), silica (SiO2), aluminium oxide 
(Al203) and iron oxide (Fe2O3) are heated at very high temperatures to form a rock like 
substance which is ground into fine powder called Cement. Cement it itself is not a 
binder, but develops the binding property as a result of hydration from chemical 
reactions between cement minerals and water. (Proxald. 2015).  The most common 
type of cement is known as Portland cement, which is used as an ingredient in concrete 
production (Kaushik, 2004). There are majorly two types of Portland cement, namely; 
Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) which is produced by an automated, dry manufacturing 
process under strict quality assurance at all manufacturing stages and Portland 
Pozzolana Cement (PPC) which is produced by using a pozzolanic material as the main 
ingredients used in the preparation and should not exceed 30% of the total OPC (Kim, 
2010). Cement is classified into five classes according to ASTM C 150 from Type I to 
Type V depending on the purpose and use in the building and construction industry. 
Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) 
This is produced by an automated, dry manufacturing process under strict quality 
assurance at all stages. It comes in a range of specifications to suit a number of 
conditions and applications such as dry lean mixes, general purpose ready mixes, high 
strength pre-cast and pre-stressed concrete (Ashok et al., 2016). 

10 
 
Portland cement clinker is typically made by heating a mixture of limestone and clay 
to a temperature of about 14000C to 16000C. The main compounds in the clinker are 
Cao, SiO2, Al2O3 and Fe2O3, which account for 61-67%, 19-23%, 2.5-6% and 0-06% of 
the mass of the clinker respectively (Aslantas, 2010). The available grades in Uganda 
are OPC-42 Grade and OPC-52 Grade. 
Portland Pozzolana Cement (PPC) 
PPC id produced by using pozzolanic materials as one of the main ingredients. The 
percentage of pozzolanic material used in the preparation should not exceed 30% of the 
total OPC (Kim 2010). There is reduction in the cement strength with exceeded 
percentage. PPC is gains higher compressive strength with age, highly resistant to 
Sulphur attacks, better workability during concrete production, low heat generation 
during the setting and gains high tensile strength. 
Cement consist of types that are primarily classified according to ASTM C 150 into five 
classes; 
I. 
Type I cement is general purpose cement suitable for all uses not requiring 
the special properties of other types. It is commonly used for pavements, 
floors, reinforced concrete buildings, bridges, tanks, reservoirs, pipe, 
masonry units and precast concrete products, thus more economical than 
type II cement. 7 
II. 
Type II cement is used where relatively low heat generation is desired or 
where moderate sulfate attack may occur. The C3A content increase of 
early heat is comparatively lower than that of other cement types. 

11 
 
III. 
Type III cement provides more rapid development of strength at an early 
age after contact with water because of its higher surface area and 
increased C35 content. It is mostly used when high strength is desirable 
IV. 
Type IV cement is needed where heat generation from hydration should 
be minimized such as in mass concrete structures. It generates less heat 
at a slower rate than the other cement types since its C25 content is 
higher and C35 content increased. As a result, this type has greater 
resistance to sulfate attack than for type I or type II, with less rapid 
strength development having equal strength at advanced ages. 
V. 
Type V cement is used where high sulfate resistance is desired say in 
foundation and marine structures. The C3A content of the cement is 
limited to less than 5% in the specification when a sulfate expansion test 
is not available. 
2.1.1.2.2 AGGREGATE 
Aggregates make up 70% of the concrete volume, hence the main constituent materials 
in concrete production according to Gnanavel 2014. Aggregates are mostly derived from 
crushed solid rock or weathered rock, resulting to broad category of grains, classified 
by particle size and consistency in construction. Coarse aggregates have particle size 
larger than 4.75mm (No. 4 sieve) while the fine particles have particle sizes smaller 
than 4.75mm but larger than 75mm (No. 200 sieve) (Newman, 2013). Aggregates 
exhibits properties which affect the performance of the concrete, since they form 
mortar grout and fill voids in concrete along with cement past. 

12 
 
2.1.1.2.3 WATER 
Water plays a vital role in cement hydration where minerals in cement form chemical 
bonds with water molecules and makes the concrete workable (Kucche, 2015). Water 
greatly affects the workability of concrete which largely depends on the water/ratio; 
an increase in the sizes of aggregates, a reduction in water/cement ration and use of 
rounded aggregates will reduce the water demand, thus leading to a reduced slump. 
For strong and workable concrete, the water/cement ration should be balance, since 
too much water reduces concrete strength, while overly reduced water makes the 
concrete unworkable (Kosmatka, 2014). 
2.1.2 BASALT ROCK POWDER 
This is a fine-grained material that is obtained by crushing basalt rocks and is typically 
dark in color, ranging from black to dark gray, due to its high content of dark-colored 
minerals such as pyroxene and olivine. Basalt rock has been used in the construction 
industry for various applications but majorly as aggregates due to its availability, 
sustainability, durability and strength properties (Qiao, 2019). Basalt rock powder (BRP) 
has a large specific surface area and high SiO2 and Al2O3 contents thus when used as a 
supplementary cementitious material, it can have a positive impact on the mechanical 
properties. This is because basalt rock powder forms a gel on hydration, when Calcium 
Oxide from Cement reacts with SiO2, resulting into nucleation of the C-S-H and 
strengthening the bond between basalt and the matrix (Li, 2022).

2.1.3 AREA OF APPLICATION 
The BRP concrete will be largely utilized in construction of columns, pavements and 
sidewalks. This is because the study aims at producing a compressive structure with the 
ability resist compressive loads other than tensile Loads 
2.2 EMPIRICAL LITERATURE REVIEW 
2.2.1 BASALT ROCK POWDER 
Basalt rock powder can be used as a supplementary material in concrete to improve its 
mechanical strength. A study investigated the feasibility of using BRP and Superfine 
sand as partial replacement for Portland cement and artificial sand in mortar. The 
results showed that the use of BRP and superfine sand as partial replacement materials 
for Portland cement and artificial sand respecting in cement mortar is feasible (Qiao, 
2019). Another study investigated the effect of basalt powder on hydration, rheology 
and strength development of cement past. The results showed that the use of basalt 
powder can improve the strength development of cement paste (Li, 2022). Also, 
another study investigated the effect of Basalt Powder on the properties of Cement 
Composites. The results obtained show that the basaltic powder has a positive effect 

14 
 
on the consistency of fresh cement composites and strength of the hardened composite 
(Unčík, 2013). Also, when carried out on Basalt powder as a supplementary 
cementitious material in cement past for CCS wells, due to basalt powder 
characteristics, the chemical resistance increased resistance for formulation of cement 
having low Basalt powder quantity as a result of porosity and permeability reducing, 
due to the gaps getting filled in the network of porous cement (Ponzi, 2021). According 
to Dobiszewska M (2018), the addition of waste basalt powder as a replacement of sand 
in concrete improves its compressive and flexural strength due to the filler effect, and 
also results in a denser and stronger interfacial transition zone microstructure. Also, 
according to the microstructural analysis, the presence of basalt powder in concrete 
mixes is beneficial for cement hydration products and basalt powder substituted 
concretes have lower porosity within the interfacial transitional zone (Dobiszewska, 
2020). 
2.3 RESEARCH GAP 
Several researches have been carried out on basalt rock powder as a partial 
replacement of cement in cement mortar and partial replacement of sand in concrete 
and lots of evidence have been provided for the improvements in strength. However, 
the research on determining the optimum percentage of basalt rock powder with known 
fineness for partial replacement of cement in conventional concrete is lacking and this 
is what our research is focusing to archive.

CHAPTER THREE: METHODOLOGY 
3.0 INTRODUCTION 
This chapter contains the descriptions of materials used in the experimentations during 
the study. The chapter gives explanations of various tests performed to achieve our set 
of objectives such as the sieve analysis test (particle size distribution, aggregate 
crushing value, aggregate impact value (AIV), water absorption, flakiness index, 
specific gravity, compressive strength test, abrasion test, porosity and permeability 
test. All in all, this chapter gives details on; 
a) The materials acquired from various locations; Sand, cement, coarse aggregates 
and basalt rock powder. 
b) Properties of concrete ingredients and basalt rock powder; sieve analysis of both 
fine and coarse aggregates, flakiness index, specific gravity, water absorption, 
aggregate impact value, aggregate crushing value, silt content. 
c) The mix design proportions, slump test, casting of cubes and curing of the cubes 
d) Properties of optimized BRP concrete; compressive strength, porosity and 
permeability. 
3.1 MATERIAL ACQUISITION 
The following materials were acquired from various locations; Sand, cement, coarse 
aggregates and basalt rock powder; 
3.1.1 NATURAL COARSE AGGREGATE, FINE AGGREGATE (SAND) 
The coarse aggregates, fine aggregates (fine sand) were given freely by a team of 
technicians at China lab which reduced on the hustle for materials. A number of tests 

16 
 
were conducted on these materials like sieve analysis test, ACV, AIV, specific gravity, 
abrasion value test, flakiness etc. 
3.1.2 CEMENT 
The type of cement used in this study was Portland Tororo cement (Portland Pozzolana 
Cement) as it conforms to the KS EAS 18-1 cement standards as adopted from the EN-
197 specification that is equivalent to the Uganda specification US EAS 18-1. Cement as 
a material act as a binding agent when it’s mixed with water, since a chemical reaction 
takes during the hardening process of cement while binding together with aggregates. 
3.1.3 WATER 
National water and sewage cooperation was the provider for our water source. It is 
important to note that water as material influences workability and strength of 
concrete greatly and this depends on the quantity used during mix of fresh concrete. 
3.1.4 BASALT ROCK POWDER 
The basalt rock powder was obtained by crushing basalt rocks at Mugarama Stone Quarry 
in Kibaale District with a geo crusher and then pounded to the smallest particle size of 
5mm and below, that were sieved for various tests and experiments such as; sieve 
analysis tests, specific gravity, x-ray fluorescence etc. 
3.2 PROPERTIES OF CONCRETE MATERIALS TO BE USED IN THE BASALT ROCK 
POWDER CONCRETE (BRP CONCRETE) 
3.2.1 SIEVE ANALYSIS 
This method is used for the determination of the particle size distribution of the 
materials and the test will be carried out to determine the physical property of course 

17 
 
and fine aggregates (sand). The result will help in the understanding of aggregates 
distribution with size so as to conform to standard of design and control requirements 
and specifications. The following steps are taken to determine the particle size 
distribution of aggregates 
1. Sample to be tested are dried to a constant weight at a temperature of 110+50C 
and weighed 
2. The samples are then sieved through sieves of different sizes in accordance with 
BS EN 1629 or IS sieves. After sieving, the material on each sieve is weighed 
3. Cumulative weight passing through each sieve is calculated as a percentage of 
total sample weight 
4. Fineness modulus is obtained by adding cumulative percentage of aggregates 
retained on each sieve and diving the sum by 100 
5. A graph of cumulative percentage passing against sieve sizes is plotted on a semi-
log graph with particle size as abscissa (log scale) and the aggregates are 
classified using unified classification system. 
3.2.2 FLAKINESS INDEX (FI) – BS 812: SECTION 105.1 1990 
Flakiness index is one of the tests used to classify aggregates and stones. Aggregates 
are classified as flaky when they have a thickness of less than 60% of their mean sieve 
size. Flaky particles are separated from the mass of aggregates retained on FI sieves 
expressed as a percentage. Thus, FI is the mass of aggregates in percentage with 
minimum dimension less than 0.6 times its mean dimension. The test only applies to 
material that are passing 63 mm sieve and is retained on a 6.30 mm BS test sieve. 

18 
 
3.2.3 WATER ABSORPTION 
The water absorption test was carried out to determine the maximum amount of water 
the coarse aggregates can absorb as per BS: 812: 1975. This test gives an idea on the 
strength of coarse aggregates and their internal structure. From analysis of results, it’s 
easier whether your aggregates are more porous or less porous in nature. 
3.2.4 SPECIFIC GRAVITY/RELATIVE DENSITY 
The specific gravity test is performed to measure the quality or strength of coarse 
aggregates to be used in construction. It is observed at the end of this test that 
aggregates with low specific gravity are known to be weak material compared to 
aggregates with higher specific gravity. 
While carrying out these tests, a sample not less than 2kg is used and the apparatus 
include perforated wire basket, plastic coated with wire hangers for suspending it from 
the balance, dry soft absorbent cloth, water-tight container for suspending the basket, 
shallow tray of minimum 650 sq.cm area, air-tight container of a capacity similar to the 
basket and an oven are used in the process. 
Both water absorption test and specific gravity test are considered to be a measure of 
strength of the material. Specific gravity is the ratio of the weight of a given volume of 
aggregate to the weight of an equal volume of water. It is the measure of strength or 
quality of the specific material. The apparent specific gravity of the commonly used 
rocks ranges from 2.6 to 2.7 as per standards BS: 812: 197 
3.2.5 AGGREGATE CRUSHING VALUE (ACV) 
ACV test is conducted to understand how coarse aggregates resist gradually applied 
compressive load up to crushing point (A measure of resistance). For weak aggregates, 

19 
 
the integrity of the structure is likely to be adversely affected. The ACV is determined 
by measuring the material passing a specified sieve after crushing under a load of 
400kN. The test can be applied to a standard fraction aggregate passing a 14mm sieve 
and retained on a 10mm sieve. Note that the method is not suitable for testing 
aggregates with an ACV higher than 30. In such cases the method for Ten percent fines 
value (TFV) is applicable, as per CML Test no. 2.7 
3.2.6 AGGREGATE IMPACT VALUE (AIV) 
The AIV test is performed to assess the mechanical degradation of coarse aggregates by 
subjecting them to a known load and their resistance determined. The test is a measure 
of toughness of coarse aggregates to resist their disintegration on due to impact as per 
BS 812: Part 112: 1990. A 28 cylindrical measure and plunger, compression testing 
machine and test sieves of sizes 14mm and 10mm were used to determine the AIV of 
the aggregates. 
3.3 PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF BASALT ROCK POWDER 
3.3.1 SIEVE ANALYSIS – BS EN 933-1:1997 
Sieve analysis is the method of determining the particle size distribution of the 
materials. This test will be carried out to determine the physical property of stone dust. 
This test was carried out to know particles distribution with size so as to conform to 
design standards and control requirements. 
3.3.2 RELATIVE DENSITY AND WATER ABSORPTION 
The relative density test is carried out to measure the quality or strength of basalt rock 
powder to be used in the construction while the maximum amount of water that the 

20 
 
basalt rock powder absorbs was determined by carrying out the water absorption test 
as per BS: 812: 1975. To get the idea on strength of basalt rock powder and the internal 
structure, the water absorption test is key. 
3.3.3 BULK DENSITY 
During the determination of the mass or weight of the basalt rock powder that is 
required to fill a specific unit volume of concrete, the bulk density test is used. The 
higher the bulk density, the higher the volume of basalt rock powder that the concrete 
mix will occupy 
3.3.3 X-RAY FLOURESCENCE (XRF) 
This is a technique that analytically determines the composition of elements of several 
materials like rocks, sediments and fluids. In X-ray fluorescence, the emitted X-rays are 
detected and analyzed to determine the elemental composition. 
Sample Preparation 
Basalt rock powder (BRP) is typically prepared by two common forms; compressed 
powder pellets where the powdered sample is compressed into pellet using a hydraulic 
press and Fused Glass Discs where the sample is mixed with a flux usually Lithium 
compound and heated to form a glass disc. These sample forms ensure uniformity and 
facilitate X-ray penetration. 
The XRF spectrometer consists of X-ray tube, sample holder, X-ray detector and 
spectrometer which is calibrated using known standard samples. After detection, 
analysis, quantification and calibration, the software analyses the XRF data and 
provides elemental concentrations with major elements; Na Mg, Al, Si, Ca etc. 

21 
 
3.4 CONCRETE MIX DESIGN FOR M25 
There is various mix design but for our project the M25 is the most favorable since the 
concrete in our study has a pozzolana material. With reference to various literature 
studied, this research has been able to develop the mix design. So, several trial mixes 
were carried out based on literature, so as to get the final mix to be used to get the 
results presented in the report 
Test: Compressive Strength 
During compressive strength test, numerous cubes were to be used for triplicates per 
replacement with basalt rock powder. Three cubes were casted for each set of 
replacement, therefore using the standard for experiment referred to as “triplicates” 
for the compressive strength test which had two sets of days i.e. 7 and 28 curing days. 
There was casting of control experiment and the following percentages; 0%, 10%, 15%, 
20%, 25% and 30%. As a result, the cubes casted were 36 in total. 
3.5 DETERMINING PROPERTIES OF THE OPTIMIZED CONCRETE MIX WITH BASALT ROCK 
POWDER 
3.5.1 FRESH CONCRETE SLUMP TEST 
This slump test was carried out to evaluate the flow characteristics of freshly mixed 
concrete containing basalt rock powder and the other normal concrete ingredients and 
it will be carried out in accordance with BS 1881: Part 102: 1983. The slump test was 
performed by concrete placing in a cone of inverted shape at three levels, and then the 
concrete tamped down up to when it’s full using a metal tamping rod. Using the handles 
on both sides, lifting of the cone off working surface is performed carefully. Measuring 
of the height between the slumped height of fresh concrete and slump cone original 

22 
 
height. Normally, the desired slumps for fresh concrete should range between 4 to 5 
inches to obtain an ideal balance between workability and consistency 
Preparation of test cubes from fresh concrete 
This process involves the making of concrete cubes for testing of compressive strength, 
porosity and permeability where 3 concrete cubes shall be casted for each trial mix and 
then place for 7 and 28 curing days. 
Procedure 
A thin layer of oil is applied on the inside faces of cube mold plates, after carrying out 
the slump test of already mixed fresh concrete. Then a sample of fresh concrete is put 
into the mold in three layer and after every layer a tapping rod is used to compact the 
concrete in order to remove voids.

(Image source:  civiltoday.com) 
3.5.2 HARDENED CONCRETE COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH TEST 
The term compressive strength defines the ability of material or structure to carry the 
loads on its surface without any crack or deflection. The test is carried out in 
accordance with BS 1881 part 116: 1983 and it will be performed on cubes of hardened 
concrete containing basalt rock powder after curing of 7 days and 28days 
Procedure for performing compressive strength test on concrete cubes 

23 
 
Fresh concrete is poured in the mold of 15x15x15cm (150x150mx150) in three layers 
and after every layer it is compacted using tamping rod properly to remove voids. After 
it is left for 24 hours and then the molds are removed and cubes placed in water for 
curing of 7 and 28 days. After the set of curing days, the cubes are tested by 
compression machine where load is applied gradually at the rate of 140kg/cm2 per 
minute till the specimen fails, then the compressive strength computed by dividing the 
applied Load with cross-sectional area of the cube.

CHAPTER FOUR: RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
4.0 INTRODUCTION 
This chapter shows the results obtained from the various tests conducted on the 
materials used in the concrete mix and explained using tables and graphs. 
4.1 DETERMINATION OF PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF CONCRETE AGGREGATES 
4.1.1 SIEVE ANALYLSIS TEST ON AGGREGATES 
This test also known as gradation test, is very essential as it helps technicians in the 
quality control of aggregate samples. This is used in determining the distribution of 
aggregate particles by size in order to comply with the design, production control 
requirements and verification specifications. This test ensures the separation of fine 
particles with the coarse ones during test process using various sieves sizes for the 
sample material. As a result the retained mass of a material on every sieve size is used 
for fineness modulus determination.

Figure 4: Particle size distribution chart for fine aggregates 
A well graded aggregate with a narrower particle size distribution. The fineness modulus 
also gives lower value of 2.3 hence finer sand. The visualized date in the grading curve 
indicates fine aggregates being within the standard for use in the concrete mix. 
4.1.2 FINENESS MODULUS 
This is a numerical index of fineness that gives idea of the mean size of the particles in 
the aggregates and used as a method of standardization of the grading of the 
aggregates. It can therefore be used as the measure of workability of sand according to 
ASTM (ASTM C33 1954). Fineness modulus can be computed as 600 minus total sums of 
cumulative percentages retained on sieve and then divided by 100. The fineness 
modulus is also used in mix design since the gradation of fine aggregates determines 
the density and permeability of the concrete, high fineness modulus implies low density 
and low permeability of concrete. Thus a fineness modulus of 2.3 is fine aggregate 
suitable for concrete matrix used good strength and durability. 

28 
 
4.1.3 FLAKINESS INDEX (FI) 
This is the percentage by weight of particles whose average least dimension is less than 
three-fifths (0.6 times) of their mean dimension, thus the particle is considered as flaky 
if its thickness is less than o.6 times the mean sieve size of the fraction. Flaky particles 
have a large surface area relative to its small volume, hence it decreases the workability 
of concrete mix. The flaky particles can affect the durability of concrete as they tend 
to be oriented in one plane, with water and voids forming underneath.

15.6 
A flakiness index value of 15.6% a good unflaky sample of aggregates as these particles 
affect the durability of concrete. The value is within the acceptable range for many 
concrete applications and suitable to improve concrete performance and mix design 
optimization. 
4.2 AGGREGATE CRUSHING VALUE (ACV) TEST ON COARSE AGGREGATES 
This is the percentage by weight of crushed material obtained when test aggregates are 
subjected to a specified load under standardized conditions. Aggregate crushing value 
test on coarse aggregates gives a relative measure of the resistance of an aggregate 
crushing under gradually applied compressive load. According to BS 8122 PART 110, ACV 
gives the relative measure of crushing under an increasing compressive load. The 
method is applicable to aggregates passing a 14.0 mm test sieve and retained on a 10.0 
mm 
test 
sieve. 

29 
 
 
Figure 5: Graph for ACV 
The graph gives an ACV of 13.5% against the maximum value 25, indicating a good 
aggregate strength hence less disintegration against pressure. Lower ACV implies the 
aggregates are stronger, which indicates that the aggregates are more durable with 
longer service life thus very valuable performance. The crushing value should not 
exceed 25% for construction as per standard BS 812 PART 110: 1990. If the ACV is 25 or 
more, the result may be anomalous and thus the ten percent fines value should be 
determined instead. 
4.3 AGGREGATE IMPACT VALUE (AIV) TEST ON COARSE AGGREGATES 
The ACV test is used to determine the aggregate impact value which gives a relative 
measure of the resistance of an aggregate of sudden shock or impact, which in some 
aggregates differ from their resistance to a slowly applied compressive load. The AIV is 
obtained by calculating the percentage loss of weight particles passing 2.36 mm sieve 
by the application of load by means of 15 blows of standard hammer and drop under 
specified condition.  

30 
 
Table 5: AIV mean value calculations for coarse aggregates 
 
As per BS 812 PART 110: 1990 and the above specifications, the AIV for concrete in non-
wearing areas is to be less than 45% by weight and 25% in wearing areas say runaways. 
From the results above of coarse aggregates, a mean value of 16.4 % was obtained and 
thus the coarse aggregates are suitable for use in concrete. 
4.1 LOS ANGELES ABRASION VALUE (LAAV) TEST ON COARSE AGGREGATES 
Table 6: LAAV calculations for coarse aggregates 
 
LAAV of 19.6% suggests a strong resistance to abrasion. The LAAV represents the 
percentage of material lost by weight during the abrasion test. A higher LAAV indicates 

31 
 
a greater abrasion of the aggregate and by extension, potentially reduced durability of 
the concrete. If the LAAV exceeds allowable limits, adjustments can be made in the 
aggregate selection or mix design to improve resistance 
4.2 RELATIVE DENSITY AND WATER ABSORPTION FOR COARSE AGGREGATES 
Table 7: The calculated relative density and water absorption values 
 
Water absorption test is to determine the amount of water absorbed by aggregate using 
the specified conditions. According to the test carried out, little quantity of water is 
absorbed by the coarse aggregates  as shown in results that is 0.36% thus meaning 
water absorption consideration can be neglected in the mix design, as per BS 882: Part 
2 1995, the standard water absorption should less than 2%  
Relative density test is carried out as a measure of quality for coarse aggregates and it 
is also denotes a measure of the specific gravity of the aggregates 
The apparent specific gravity of the commonly used rocks ranges from 2.6 to 2.7 as per 
standards BS 882: 1992. According to the results obtained as shown in appendix 
apparent specific gravity of the coarse aggregates used was 2.665 coarse aggregates 
thus the aggregates are suitable for use in concrete since they are in recommended 
range as per standard.

Figure 6: BRP particle size distribution chart 
The powder is composed of both fine particles and coarse particles compared to the 
fine aggregates. About 32.8% passes through the 0.075mm sieve, the percentages to be 
used in casting concrete cubes so as to have finer powder reacting with other concrete 
ingredients. The sieve analysis test was conducted for BRP with maximum particle size 
of 5mm and grading curve indicates that 32.85% passed through the 0.075mm, the 
target particle size. However, since the powder (BRP) exhibited relatively uniform 
particle characteristics throughout its composition, the additional insights gained from 
a hydrometer test will not substantially alter the conclusion drown from the sieve 
analysis results ( Mir, 2021). 
4.3.2 PARTICLE DENSITY AND WATER ABSORPTION FOR BASALT ROCK POWDER 
Table 10: The calculated particle density and water absorption results 

34 
 
 
The apparent particle density which relates to the relative density (specific gravity) is 
3.0376mg/m3 indicating that the mass of BRP particles per unit volume, taking into 
account any void spaces within the particles. The Water absorption of 3.8% indicates 
the absorption capacity of BRP weight in the water when fully saturated. Since BRP 
moderately absorbs water, the total water content of the mixture shall be adjusted to 
compensate, and this is vital in achieving desired workability, strength and durability 
of concrete with calculated W/C ratio in accordance to BS 812: Part 2: 1995

strength, durability, setting time, color effects and also indicates the presence of 
mineral compositions of plagioclase, pyroxene and olivine (Ponzi, 2021). The powder is 
from a mafic rock, resulting to Pozzolanic reaction during concrete mix.

4.6 OPTIMAL PERCENTAGE REPLACEMENT OF PHYSICAL AND MECHANICAL 
PROPERTIES OF CONCRETE INCORPORATED WITH BASALT ROCK POWDER AND 
CEMENT 
4.6.1 SLUMP TEST 
This test is carried out to determine the workability accordance to BS 1881: 1983 
British Standards so as to ascertain the workability of fresh concrete for each mix in 
the research. The test is a measure of the consistency of the fresh concrete and how 
easily the concrete can be cast and compacted to form the required shape without any 
segregation

Figure 7: A graph for workability of BRP concrete 
From the graph above, it can be noticed that the slump increases with increase in BRP 
content in the concrete mix. As the percentage of BRP increases from 0% to 30%, the 
slump values also show a general increasing trend. A slump value of 81mm for 0% BRP 
suggests a moderately stiff concrete mix, whereas higher slump values for BRP 
incorporated mixes indicated improved workability. 
This increase in slump indicates that the addition of BRP enhances the workability of 
the concrete mixes, potentially due to the finer particle size and smoother surface 
texture of the BRP compared to cement particles according to Li, 2022 
Standard Deviation 
The standard deviation is the average amount of variability in your dataset, telling us 
on average how far each value lies from the mean. A high standard deviation means 
that values are generally far from the mean, while a low standard deviation indicates 
that the values are clustered close to the mean (Bhandari, 2021)

Sample, 81mm, 85mm, 87mm, 90mm, 93mm, 98mm for 0%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25% and 
30% BRP content by volume fraction respectively 
𝑀𝑒𝑎𝑛= 81 + 85 + 87 + 90 + 93 + 98

𝑀𝑒𝑎𝑛= 89𝑚𝑚 
𝑉𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒
= (81 −89)2 + (85 −89)2 + (87 −89)2 + (90 −89)2 + (93 −89)2 + (98 −89)2

𝑉𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒= 30.33𝑚𝑚 
𝑆𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑎𝑟𝑑 𝐷𝑒𝑣𝑖𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 (𝑆𝐷) = √𝑉𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 
𝑆𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑎𝑟𝑑 𝐷𝑒𝑣𝑖𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛= √30.33 = 5.51𝑚𝑚 
This gives an approximate deviation of 6 SD. This means that the average deviation of 
individual values form the mean slump value of 89 mm is approximately 7mm, providing 
a valuable information about the variability and precision of slump measurements in 
the study on BRP concrete. It helps to assess the reliability of the mean value and 
informs decisions related to mix design, construction practices and quality control in 
concrete production.
