ABSTRACT 
The issue of access to clean drinking water continues to be a great struggle in various 
rural locations where the sources of groundwater are becoming more and more polluted 
with heavy metals and other inorganic substances. At the same time, heavy metals such 
as lead (Pb²⁺) and copper (Cu²⁺) are classified as hazards of the highest order due to their 
toxic nature, persistence, and bioaccumulation (Tchobanoglous et al., 2014). A study on 
water quality in Kyabalogo Village, Nakisunga Sub-county, Mukono District, Uganda, 
indicated the existence of Pb and Cu in the spring water exceeding the tolerable limits 
for drinking water. Therefore, the water cannot be used in households without prior 
purification. 
The current work is focused on the application of natural zeolite as an inexpensive and 
effective adsorbent to purify the spring groundwater by removing Pb²⁺ and Cu²⁺ at the 
household level. Previous literature shows that divalent heavy metals can be taken away 
by zeolites by 80–95% via ion-exchange processes, where the ions of the heavy metals 
Pb²⁺ and Cu²⁺ in the solution replace the cations (e.g., Na⁺, K⁺, Ca²⁺) that are in the 
zeolite lattice (Misaelides, 2011). The results of this research work are expected to 
provide a cheap and an eco-friendly approach solution for the rural water treatment 
community. (Wang & Peng, 2010).

CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION 
This chapter includes the background, problem statement and geographical scope and 
justification of this research project. 
1.1 BACKGROUND 
Pollution from both point and non-point sources still continue to pollute essential water 
resources on a global scale. Major contributors to the pollution of both surface water 
and groundwater are industrial discharges, domestic sewage, agricultural runoff, and 
changes in the environment (WHO, 2024). In many parts of the world that are still 
developing, groundwater that people rely on for drinking purposes is slowly discovered 
to contain harmful inorganic pollutants and especially heavy metals such as lead (Pb), 
copper (Cu), iron (Fe), and cadmium (Cd). These metals are unyielding, non-
degradable, and their presence even in minuscule amounts causes a very serious health 
risk (Tchobanoglous et al., 2014). 
 
By the year 2035, the global population increase is estimated to be around 7.9 billion, 
and consequently, the water crisis is to be more severe than it is now, particularly in 
rural areas where the supply of water treatment facilities is limited (WHO, 2024). The 
conventional use of filtration by households such as plain sand filtration, membrane 
filters, and biochar filters has been found to be inadequate as poor adsorption capacity 
and large variation in maintaining the level of metals below that of the drinking water 
standard have been cited as the causes. 
 

2 
 
Among the various treatment methods available, the one based on adsorption has 
gained recognition as the most efficient and at the same time the least expensive 
solution to heavy metals removal. Natural zeolites in particular are the most popular 
ones, boasting the property of having the highest cation-exchange capacity, micropore 
structure, and strong affinity for the divalent metal ion such as Pb²⁺ and Cu²⁺ (Wang & 
Peng, 2010). In this manner, zeolites can swap their cations (Na⁺, Ca²⁺, K⁺) for those of 
toxic metals, significantly reducing the concentration of metals in contaminated water 
within minutes (Misaelides, 2011). 
This research focuses on the purification of Kyabalogo Village, Nakisunga Sub- by using 
modified zeolites as an adsorbent for household drinking water. 
 
1.2 PROBLEM STATEMENT 
The major sources of water in Uganda are underground, and in addition to that, natural 
springs are also used for domestic purposes, drinking water, and small-scale economic 
activities. In Kyabalogo village, Nakisunga sub-county, the spring water is the main 
source of water since it is free, easy to access, and available all year round. However, 
human activities such as improper waste disposal, agricultural runoff, and unregulated 
land use around these water sources have deteriorated the quality of the water 
significantly (WHO, 2024). 
 
Water quality monitoring from community springs in central Uganda indicates the 
presence of heavy metals and pathogenic microorganisms in large quantities (Nzanzu et 
al., 2022) The heavy metals Pb, Cu, and Cd are listed among the ones that are very 

3 
 
toxic and detrimental to the health of living organisms at very low concentrations 
(Tchounwou et al., 2012). Furthermore, with the presence of pathogens in the water, 
the risk to public health is even greater, with fecal coliforms being detected in the range 
of 1000 CFU/100 mL (Nzanzu et al., 2022). 
 
A good number of the Kyabalogo Village residents are elderly or low-income and thus 
cannot afford the piped water from the National Water and Sewerage Corporation 
(NWSC). They, therefore, rely on spring water that is likely to be contaminated by human 
activities and groundwater infiltration of heavy metals. Hence, the need for developing 
inexpensive household-scale treatment systems is very critical. 
 
Popular household filtration systems like sand filters, membrane filters, and cloth 
filtration have not shown high efficiency in the removal of dissolved heavy metals. On 
the other hand, natural zeolites are known for their high cation-exchange capacity and 
great attraction to divalent heavy metals like Pb²⁺ and Cu²⁺, which makes the 
1.3 OBJECTIVES OF STUDY 
1.3.1 Main objective 
To use modified zeolites in water treatment at household level a case study of Kyabalogo 
village, Nakisunga Sub-County 
 
1.3.2 Specific objectives 
1. To determine the physicochemical properties of three selected springs in 
Kyabalogo village, Nakisunga Sub-County

2. To determine the removal efficiency of natural zeolites in water treatment 
3. To design a simple household water treatment system.  
 
1.4 
Research questions 
1. 
What are the current heavy metal concentrations in the water of the three 
selected springs in Kyabalogo Village, Nakisunga Sub-County? 
2. 
How to determine the removal efficiency of natural zeolites in water treatment? 
3. 
What are the specifications of the household treatment system to be designed? 
 
1.5 JUSTIFICATION 
Zeolites are regarded as the most efficient crystalline aluminosilicates minerals for 
water-treatment media applications, thanks to their remarkable capability of removing 
heavy metals such as lead (Pb²⁺) and copper (Cu²⁺) from water. The main reasons for 
their high efficiency are their high cation-exchange capacity, porous structure, and 
excellent affinity for divalent metal ions. Clinoptilolite, a natural zeolite, is the most 
commonly used mineral as it is regarded as a very low-cost, eco-friendly, and selective 
adsorbent for toxic metals in drinking water (Sprynskyy et al., 2006; Wang & Peng, 2010). 
 
Ion exchange occurs mainly as a mechanism of sorption whereby metal ions in solution 
displace the weaker cationic exchangeable ones (Na⁺, K⁺, Ca²⁺) of the zeolite. This 
phenomenon can be illustrated as follows: 
 
2(Z–Na)+Pb2+→(Z)2–Pb+2Na+ 

5 
 
2(Z–Na)+Cu2+→(Z)2–Cu+2Na+ 
Zeolites additionally eliminate heavy metals through surface adsorption and 
complexation, thus making them multifunctional. As a result of their high efficiency, 
simplicity, low operational cost, and compatibility with household water treatment, 
adsorption has been identified as the preferred method over such treatments as 
membrane filtration, precipitation, and solvent extraction (Foo & Hameed, 2010). 
 
Among the possible adsorbents, zeolites win due to their very large specific surface area, 
permanent negative framework charge, natural occurrence, and water resistance. It has 
been proven on many occasions that zeolites possess an extremely strong selection for 
Pb²⁺ and Cu²⁺ ions even when the competing ions are Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺ (Inglezakis & Zorpas, 
2012). Thus, they could very well be applied in the treatment of natural groundwater in 
rural areas like Mukono, where heavy metals may be above the stipulated limits. 
 
To sum up, zeolites, with their combination of low cost, selectivity, and high efficacy, 
become the ideal option for household water treatment. They are distinguished by their 
dual Roman Catholic and Orthodox mechanisms of ion-exchange and adsorption with 
natural availability, which are the best choice for Pb²⁺ and Cu²⁺ removal from spring 
groundwater and as a natural resource that is readily available in the rocks of Mbale 
proven performance. 
1.6 GEOGRAPHICAL SCOPE 
The study focused on three springs located in Kyabalogo village, Nakisunga Sub-County, 
Central Region (0034/40.0// N, 60000/30.0// E). The presence of many springs (both 

6 
 
protected and unprotected) is a characteristic of the area, but the researchers chose 
to study only three springs which are most likely to get contaminated because of their 
location.

CHAPTER TWO: LITERATURE REVIEW 
2.0 Introduction 
This chapter comprises of details of current academic literature, reviews, theories and 
general information specific to this research project from existing published 
information in peer reviewed articles, books, conference papers and others. 
2.1 Heavy metals 
There are definitions that dictate heavy metals according to their toxicity meaning that 
they are very harmful even if present in very small concentrations and thus arsenic, 
lead, and mercury have been said to be more dangerous than iron, copper, and zinc 
which are considered to be the body’s allies or have very limited effects in the amounts 
set as non-lethal for the most toxic elements. Nevertheless, the scientific community 
has come to the conclusion that heavy metals are those elements with a density greater 
than 5g/cm3 (Ali & Khan, 2018). With respect to this investigation, copper with an 
estimated density of around 8.9g/cm3 and iron with 7.9g/cm3 can definitely be 
classified as heavy metals. 
2.2 Copper 
Copper (Cu) is an indispensable trace element that functions as a cofactor for various 
enzymes, participates in the formation of connective tissues, strengthens the immune 
system, and takes part in the processing of nervous impulses (ICA, n.d). Its occurrence 
in food as well as the low levels in many water sources makes copper deficiency rare, 
if not impossible, in the general population, the exception being individuals with 
defective copper metabolism. 

8 
 
 
It is the case that copper is essential in minute quantities, but when it is present in 
large amounts, it becomes a contaminant of drinking water. To prevent health issues 
like gastrointestinal irritation, nausea, and complications in patients with Wilson's 
disease (WHO, 2017), the WHO sets a limit of 2.0 mg/L as the maximum allowable 
concentration in drinking water. Furthermore, copper at concentrations exceeding 2.5 
mg/L will alter the taste and color of the water, making it less acceptable. 
Copper contamination in groundwater systems is a common issue caused by not only 
geological sources but also leaching of contaminated soils, agricultural chemicals, and 
improper waste disposal. In contrast to the corroding copper pipes being the main 
source of contamination in piped distribution systems, rural groundwater pollution may 
come from weathered rocks, mining residues and human wastes (Zhou et al., 2024). 
Household water with excessive copper has the potential to cause laundry staining at 
the concentration of more than 1 mg/L and pipe discoloration (WHO, 2017). Traditional 
methods of household filtration do not remove dissolved Cu²⁺ ions, as copper is not 
easily removed through simple sand filtration or chlorination. While more advanced 
techniques like chemical precipitation, coagulation, membrane and ion exchange have 
been proven effective, they also tend to be expensive and complicated for low-income 
rural households. 
Adsorption, particularly the application of natural zeolites, is a cheap and an efficient 
alternative. The high cation-exchange capacity of zeolites and their ability to 
selectively bind Cu²⁺ ions make them ideal for the purification of contaminated 

9 
 
groundwater in the home setting. 
2.3 Lead  
Lead is a metal that is very toxic and has no beneficial role in the human body. The case 
of lead is different from that of trace elements: Even the least exposure might lead to 
huge health impacts, and this is especially so for vulnerable groups like children and 
pregnant women (WHO, 2021). According to the WHO, lead is a Group 2A probable human 
carcinogen, and it is very strictly stated that no amount of lead exposure is considered 
to be safe (WHO, 2021). Thus, the WHO guideline value for lead in drinking water is fixed 
at 0.01 mg/L.  
 
A vast pool of scientific studies has all pointed to the same conclusion that the 
consumption of lead-contaminated water even at levels of less than 0.1 mg/L can have 
extreme effects on brain development, general health, and even physiology of the 
organism. Lead diminishes the amount of hemoglobin made, disrupts enzyme activity and 
builds up in the bones and soft tissues of the body with time (Tchounwou et al., 2012). 
In children, lead presence in drinking water below the level of 0.05 mg/L is blamed for 
lowering IQ, hindering cognitive skills, creating behavior series, and causing growth to 
stop (Lanphear et al., 2018). Adults suffering from the similar case might face the 
problems of high blood pressure, kidney malfunction, infertility, and heart attack (Flora 
et al., 2012). 
Even higher amounts of lead in drinking water, and say, those found in rural groundwater 
and city outskirts, springs, are huge risks. Rahman et al. (2023) mention fatigue, 

10 
 
abdominal pain, memory loss, muscle weakness, and anemia as symptoms of chronic lead 
exposure. The long-term lead deposit causes neurodegeneration, seizures, and organ 
failure. Health risks depend on various factors like age, nutrition, socio-economic status, 
and exposure time (WHO, 2021). 
Groundwater percolation varies a lot, nevertheless, the major contributors are the 
geological weathering, lead plumbing corrosion, wrong batteries and paints disposal, 
and agricultural or industrial runoff (Kumar et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2024). For 
example, a rural Ugandan community like Kyabalogo Village in Nakisunga Sub-County 
frequently experiences lead pollution through geological layers, soil leaching 
contamination. These sources usually cause contamination that is more direct and 
persistent than contamination resulting from isolated human activities. 
As per the Uganda Standards (US EAS 2014), the maximum allowable limit for lead in 
potable water is 0.01 mg/L, which is in line with WHO recommendations. Lead levels 
beyond this point are not only harmful to health but also signify that the groundwater 
has been contaminated on a larger scale. 
Considering the great health risks of lead even at low levels in drinking water, it is critical 
that proper treatments are implemented. Among the adsorption-based methods, one 
especially using natural zeolites has the potential to remove Pb²⁺ from the water 
selectively, and that is due to its high cation-exchange capacity and strong affinity for 
divalent heavy metals (Wang & Peng, 2010; Misaelides, 2011). 
 
 

11 
 
2.4 Methods of removing heavy metals from water. 
Heavy metals have been removed or at least reduced to acceptable levels through a 
variety of methods that have been developed and implemented. These ways of removal 
include; Coagulation, Ion exchange, Adsorption, Chemical precipitation/neutralization, 
Membrane filtration, ion floatation which covers reverse osmosis, micro/nano/ultra- 
filtration, evaporation and electrochemical methods (Lupa et al, 2023; Senanu et al, 
2023).  
Such methods are considered to be impractical particularly in developing nations 
because of the enormity of the costs involved (operation, maintenance, education/ 
skilling) that would be incurred for the continuous use of the techniques, particularly, 
to treat the large quantities of water or over-contaminated water in order to provide 
water just adequate enough for the growing populations in vast regions with very little 
or no access to clean water for consumption (Joseph et al, 2019). Thus, the search is 
on for more affordable methods in the removal of heavy metals from water in places 
like Uganda. 
Other limitations of the conventional methods according to Gahrouei, (2024) and 
Senanu (2023) are in Table 1 below.

Method of treatment 
Limitations 
Membrane filtration: This involves the 
passage of water that is pressurized 
through membranes. The membranes 
extract the heavy metal ions allowing 
water to go through. 
High 
operation 
costs from 
energy usage to pressurize water 
Expensive membranes/membrane material 
Heavy metal species with smaller size 
than the membrane cannot be filtered 
Chemical precipitation: This involves 
chemical reagents being added to 
aqueous solutions with heavy metals and 
the reagents react to form insoluble 
solids easily precipitated out of the 
water and filtered out eventually. 
Some heavy metals have optimum pH points 
& may form water soluble compounds in 
both base and acidic conditions. Thus, pH 
adjustment is needed. 
Toxic chemical by products from the 
reactions. 
Large amounts of chemicals required for 
efficient precipitation leading to high 
operational costs. 
Large amounts of sludge produced. 
Floatation: 
Just

into water from the bases of their 
chambers binding heavy metal ions as

the top of the water surface containing 
the heavy 
metal ions and is skimmed off. 
Coagulation: Chemicals(coagulants) are 
added to destabilize charges on heavy 
metal ions forming dense colloids  that 
are  sedimented  or 
filtered from the water. 
Chemicals cannot be reused 
 
Large amounts of sludge formed daily 
Ion exchange: Solid like polymers with a

Adsorption is one of the methods used in which heavy metal ions are fixed on the surface 
of the adsorbent, hence, the elimination of heavy metals through adsorption (Lupa et 
al, 2023). The process of separation here involves removing ions from the liquid by 
either physical or chemical adsorption of the dissolved heavy metal ions. 
Physical adsorption means that the ions get trapped in the adsorbent’s porous surface. 
Hence, adsorbents with large pore size and high surface area among others are 
expected to be good ones (Akhtar et al, 2024). In contrast, chemical adsorption refers 
to the use of the chemical compounds such as functional groups that serve as binding 
sites to which the ions exhibit high affinity. 
The research on the use of waste materials in particular has been focused on the 
availability of these materials locally, thus, environmental sustainability due to the 
regeneration of the biochar (Carrasco et al, 2022). Therefore, water treatment with 
bio-sorbent waste materials. The adsorption process is also regarded as a heavy metal 
removal technique that is two in one, as it inherently involves the filtration process due 
to the media used and hence is sometimes called activated carbon filtration when 
activated carbon is used (Pillai, 2024). 
 
Numerous researches have explored the employment of both natural and altered 
zeolites for the decontamination of water, especially by the extraction of heavy metals 
like Pb²⁺ and Cu²⁺ from aquifers. The main mechanisms of zeolites are adsorption and 
cation-exchange, where the ions of metals in water are trapped and substituted by ions 

15 
 
that are on the zeolite surface. The combination of their porous crystalline structure, 
high specific surface area, and strong affinity for divalent metal ions makes zeolites 
highly efficient in household-scale treatment applications. 
 
2.6 Use of natural zeolite in treatment. 
Natural zeolites have been the subjects of extensive research owing to their ability to 
purify water by removing heavy metals and other toxic ions, especially in the case of 
groundwater contaminated with Pb²⁺ and Cu²⁺. The unique feature of zeolites which 
contributes to their effective performance is their solid structure of aluminosilicate 
that has connected micropores where metal ions can be readily adsorbed by cation 
exchange (Fernandes et al., 2022). Through the use of zeolites as a filtration or 
adsorption medium, water containing heavy metals can be treated to obtain a very low 
concentration of these metals due to the large surface area of the zeolite and the very 
strong affinity of the zeolite for divalent cations. 
 
Zeolites are natural minerals formed from the volcanic eruptions, and their primary 
location is usually in the cracks and pores of the volcanic rocks. The development of 
zeolites is associated with the destruction of volcanic glazes, feldspars, and clay 
minerals under the specific conditions of hydrothermal areas (Fernandes et al., 2022). 
Although there are more than sixty types of natural zeolite identified across the globe, 
only a few clinoptilolite, mordenite, chabazite, and heulandite are found in sufficient 
amount and with the right quality to be applied for water treatment. 
 

16 
 
Natural zeolites are, in contrast to synthetic zeolites, more versatile in the sense that 
they have a wider range of chemical compositions, pore structures, and mineralogies. 
This variability, however, is a double-edged sword and may sometimes limit their 
performance to a certain degree. But on the other hand, it is a significant advantage 
that natural zeolites are much cheaper and easier to obtain than synthetic ones; 
therefore, they can be used for rural water purification systems and household filtration 
solutions (Fernandes et al., 2022). Their use in these situations has resulted in a growing 
interest in their ability to remove toxic metals from drinking water in low-income areas, 
e.g. Kyabalogo Village. 
 
2.6.1 Adsorption 
Zeolites have a very large specific surface area and a very large cation-exchange 
capacity, which allow them to effectively adsorb metal ions that are dissolved in water. 
Their open framework of three-dimensional pores allows for the presence of a large 
number of active sites where metal ions with positive charges like Cu²⁺ and Pb²⁺ can be 
captured and held by means of surface adsorption and ion-exchange processes. Thus, 
zeolites are appropriate for the removal of heavy metals from groundwater in treatment 
applications. 
2.6.2 Ion Exchange 
Zeolites are crystalline aluminosilicates with negatively charged lattice sites that can 
exchange their native cations (such as Na⁺, K⁺, Ca²⁺) with dissolved metal ions in water. 
Through this ion-exchange mechanism, zeolites can selectively remove heavy metals 

17 
 
such as Pb²⁺ and Cu²⁺ by replacing their internal exchangeable ions with the 
contaminant ions present in the groundwater.  
2.7 Catalytic Oxidation 
Zeolites of some types may also show catalytic properties based on the active surface 
sites and the composition of the framework. Such a catalytic character, in heavy-metal 
removal, can give a boost to the adsorption process by assisting in the reactions that 
take place at the surface between the zeolite and the dissolved metal ions. Therefore, 
the binding strength of the metals like Pb²⁺ and Cu²⁺ onto the zeolite surface may be 
strengthened which would lead to an increase in the removal efficiency. 
2.7.1 pH Adjustment 
At the time of treatment, zeolites have the ability to alter as well as stabilize the pH 
level of the water that has been contaminated. A suitable pH level must be maintained 
because the adsorption efficiency of heavy metals, like Pb²⁺ and Cu²⁺, is highly pH-
dependent. During the adsorption process, zeolites can function as a mild buffering 
medium, which would generally assist in controlling sudden alterations of pH in the 
treated water and thus, increase the metal uptake efficiency.  
2.8 Modification of natural zeolites for use. 
Natural zeolite modification, a necessary process, comes first in the list of the steps to 
be taken for improving its power as an adsorbent for heavy metals, like Pb²⁺ and Cu²⁺, 
in groundwater. Impurities, blocked pores, and a limited number of active sites usually 
accompany raw zeolite, the presence of which could hinder the latter's adsorption 
efficiency. Therefore, it is necessary to apply physical and chemical modification 

18 
 
methods not only to increase the surface area and porosity of the zeolite but also to 
improve its cation-exchange capacity. 
With acid or base chemicals, one can effectively remove mineral impurities, dissolve 
carbonates and open up blocked pore channels and thus, enjoy improved ion-exchange 
performance as well as the higher affinity for metal ions (Fernandes et al., 2022). HCl, 
for example, acid treatment, can effectively lead to the exposure of more active sites 
and hence, a better binding of Pb²⁺ and Cu²⁺ ions from water. 
Furthermore, besides mineral acid treatments, the polarity and surface charge of 
zeolites have also been changed by using organic surfactants for surface modification. 
Surfactants, such as quaternary ammonium compounds, form a monolayer on the 
external surface of zeolite and this, in turn, results in better metal adsorption and 
interaction with the dissolved contaminants (Fernandes et al., 2022). 
Thermal activation, salt impregnation, and particle-size reduction are some of the 
other enhancement techniques that may come under the umbrella of household-scale 
filtration applications, whereby adsorption kinetics would be improved and, 
consequently, removal efficiency increased.

CHAPTER THREE: METHODOLOGY 
3.0 Introduction 
This chapter explains the methods and materials used to achieve the objectives of the 
research. It contains details of sampling procedures, test methods for key parameters 
on water, material samples, material preparation and attaining specifications for an 
efficient household system. 
The assessment of the removal of heavy metals (Cu and Pb) using natural Zeolites 
followed a quantitative experimental procedure. From the analysis of collected raw 
water samples to the design of the treatment system. 
 
Figure 1 : Research design flow chart 
3.1 Sampling and Sample Storage 
3.1.1 Area of study 
The research is focusing on the area Kyabalogo Village, which is located in Nakisunga 
Sub-County of Mukono District in Central Uganda (approximately at the latitude and 
longitude coordinates of (0°17′24″N, 32°46′48″E). The research is concentrated on three 
springs that are situated in the village and are the major sources of groundwater for 

20 
 
the local community's domestic use. Among the three springs, one is well protected but 
still hazardous for direct human use without prior treatment; the other two springs are 
not protected which makes them more vulnerable to contamination and hence, the safe 
drinking water supply for the local community is at risk. 
 
The groundwater from these springs is the main source of water for the local people 
who consume it for drinking, cooking, cleansing and bathing, irrigation of small areas, 
etc. The reason for this heavy reliance on springs is that most households cannot afford 
tap water from the National Water and Sewerage Corporation (NWSC). The unprotected 
springs are surrounded by humans and their activities—such as washing clothes, bathing, 
vehicles washing, watering animals, and disposing of household refuse—which definitely 
raise the contamination risk. Along with this, the nearby agricultural fields contribute 
to the problem through runoff, fertilizers, and leaching from soils giving rise to heavy 
metals and other pollutants in the groundwater. 
 
The sampling points were strategically chosen to reflect the differences in exposure: 
• Spring A (Protected) – Approx. 0°25′05″N, 32°45′10″E, situated upstream in 
a sheltered area. 
• Spring B (Unprotected) – Approx. 0°24′58″N, 32°45′20″E, midpoint close to 
domestic activities. 
• Spring C (Unprotected) – Approx. 0°24′52″N, 32°45′35″E, downstream, near 
areas for agricultural and waste disposal. 
 

21 
 
The groundwater quality in the village is represented by these springs and also the 
effectiveness of zeolite-based treatment for heavy-metal removal under household 
conditions is made possible to be assessed through these springs. 
 
3.1.2 Sampling procedure 
During a month-long period, water samples from three springs in Kyabalogo Village, 
Nakisunga Sub-County were collected on three different days: 8th, 15th, and 21st 
September. The laboratory then received the samples where they were going to 
conduct heavy metals (Pb²⁺ and Cu²⁺) analysis and assess several other physicochemical 
parameters. Besides this, the pH, electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids 
(TDS), and temperature were also measured in situ at each spring during the sampling. 
 
The sampling method was designed according to the WHO (2017) and APHA (2017) 
standard guidelines for heavy-metal water sampling. The borosilicate glass bottles to 
be used were conditioned by being washed with 1:1 nitric acid 24 hours before sampling 
this will remove any contaminants that may be left from the previous use and also 
protect the metal ions. 
 
The spring water was collected by dipping the bottles into the water at a depth of about 
20 centimeters, with the mouths angled toward the springs to prevent the intake of any 
surface debris. To maintain the quality of the samples, nitric acid (1:1) was added 
immediately after collection until the sample pH fell below 2. The sample was then 
labeled with the sample number, spring location, date, time, temperature, and pH, 

22 
 
and then kept in a cooling box with ice at 4–8°C for transport to the laboratory. 
 
This systematic sampling allowed for the continuous monitoring of groundwater quality 
changes and at the same time the reliable evaluation of the zeolite's adsorption 
capability for heavy metals removal. 
 
 
3.2 Objective I: Determination of the Physico-Chemical Characteristics of Raw 
Groundwater from Three Selected Springs in Kyabalogo Village, Sub-County  
3.2.1 Introduction 
The water quality indicators that will be examined in this goal are pH, electrical 
conductivity (EC), Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), Temperature, and the concentrations 
of heavy metals (Pb and Cu) in the unprocessed water of the three chosen springs in 
Kyabalogo village, sub-county. 
In the case of heavy metal evaluation of unprocessed groundwater, the parameters that 
are most susceptible to pollution and thus their values will be decreased or increased 
are pH, electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), and the concentrations 
of the dissolved metals like Pb²⁺ and Cu²⁺. These parameters are very important for 
the determination of water quality and also play a significant role in the evaluation of 
the treatment methods, such as zeolite adsorption, (Lu, 2021). 
3.2.2 Measuring In-situ Parameters 
At the same time, in-situ trials for the other parameters pH, electrical conductivity 
(EC), Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), Temperature, etc. were done several times at that 
location where the sample was taken by a multimeter (Model eXact pH+). The probe of 

23 
 
the multimeter was rinsed with distilled water, and then it was plunged into the sample 
to ensure that the entire sensor was submerged. The values that were on the screen of 
the multimeter were allowed to stabilize for 1–2 minutes before reading and recording 
the values of the respective parameters. 
 
3.2.3 Determining the concentration of (Cu) and (Pb) in the water samples 
The amounts of Pb²⁺ and Cu²⁺ in the spring water samples collected were determined 
by Flame Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (FAAS), according to the procedures laid out 
in APHA 3111B (APHA, 2017). The analyses were carried out after the samples (pH < 2) 
were very carefully adjusted to the original pH values which had been measured during 
collection. 
 
Each sample was fed to the spectrometer via a thin tube and subjected to a flame at 
specific wavelengths for lead and copper. The FAAS device quantified the light 
absorption by the atoms in the sample, and the software derived the absorbance values 
to determine the amount of Pb²⁺ and Cu²⁺ in mg/L based on the concentration. This 
technique allowed for accurate measurement of the heavy metals in the groundwater 
and at the same time made possible the assessment of the zeolite adsorbent’s 
effectiveness for the removal of these pollutants. 
Determining the removal efficiency of natural zeolites in water treatment 
The study used natural zeolite rocks from Mbale in Eastern Uganda. After mining, the 
zeolites were cleaned first and then crushed and sieved into different particle sizes 
before use in adsorption experiment. 

24 
 
  
 
3.3 Objective II: Determination of removal efficiency of Zeolites. 
3.3.1 Material Preparation 
The natural zeolite rocks sourced from Mbale in Eastern Uganda were initially subjected 
to a rigorous washing process with distilled water to eliminate any dirt, dust, and other 
impurities. The zeolite materials were then subjected to a drying process in the oven 
at 105°C for 24 hours to evaporate any water present. After the drying process, the 
zeolite rocks were pulverized and screened to acquire a consistent particle size of 0.6–
2 mm, which allowed for uniformity in flow and perfect interaction during the 
adsorption testing of heavy-metal removal from spring water. 
3.3.2 Preparation and Modification of Zeolite 
The first natural zeolite rocks were hammered to break them into smaller pieces, after 
which a manual aggregate crushing machine was used to make them even smaller. The 
crushed zeolite was later screened to get particle sizes ranging from 0.15 to 0.3 mm. 
Moreover, in order to eliminate impurities, the washed zeolite was packed in oven-
dried polythene bags at 70°C for 12 hours and then stored in polythene bags to avoid 
contamination by dust. 
To gain higher heavy-metal adsorption, chemical alteration of the zeolite took place. 
An 800 g amount of prepared zeolite was combined with a 1000 cm³ solution of 
anhydrous ferric chloride (FeCl₃) in water at the concentration of 21.36 g/dm³ under 
the temperature of 25°C. The mixture was subjected to stirring for 15 minutes and then 

25 
 
allowed to stand for 24 hours to enable ion exchange properly. Then the modified 
zeolite was filtered and washed with distilled water until no chloride ions were 
detected (this was confirmed with the silver nitrate test). After that, the iron(III)-
modified zeolite was dried at 70°C for 12 hours and stored in sealed polythene bags, 
which were then placed in a plastic container to shield against contamination 
(Turyasingura & Kantuntu, 2023). 
This alteration increases the cation-exchange capacity of the zeolite and its affinities 
for Pb²⁺ and Cu²⁺, thus making the zeolite more effective for treating household 
groundwater.

3.3.3 Percentage determination for the removal efficiency of Zeolites. 
The removal efficacy of zeolites was established through the determination of lead (Pb²⁺) 
and copper (Cu²⁺) concentrations in spring water before and after its treatment. Along 
with these, pH, electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), and temperature 
were measured, in-situ, to gauge water quality. The treatment outcomes were labeled 
as Cₑ (effluent concentration) and the starting concentrations in the unprocessed water 

26 
 
as Cᵢ. 
The zeolite adsorption efficiency (%) is determined through the following formula: 
Adsorption capacity = 𝐶𝑖−𝐶𝑒 × 100 (Reagan, 2019) 
A preliminary column experiment was done to investigate the best particle size and 
packing method for the zeolite to be used in a household-scale filtration system. The 
columns were placed in containers of a 6 cm diameter (D1, D2, D3) and filled randomly 
with zeolite of the same particle size (0.6–2 mm), and at the bottom was a small layer of 
cotton to support the adsorbent and prevent washout. 
Throughout the experiment, certain volumes of water from the three chosen springs were 
run through the columns, and samples were taken at the outlet for Pb²⁺ and Cu²⁺ analysis 
by FAAS. The removal rates of each zeolite column were then compared to find the best-
performing configuration for heavy-metal adsorption from spring groundwater. 
3.4 Objective III: Designing an adsorption system 
The design of the zeolite column adsorption system was based on the average day water 
requirement of a typical domestic unit in Kyabalogo Village, Nakisunga Sub-County, 
following the guidelines by the Uganda Water Supply Design Manual (MWE, 2013), the 
World Health Organization (2020), and the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (2024). 
 
The dimensions of the adsorption column were designed based on the flow rate needed 
to satisfy the daily water requirement in the household to ensure the required 
interaction time between the water and the zeolite for effective elimination of the 
Pb²⁺ and Cu²⁺ ions from the spring water. The design was meant to be suitable for 

27 
 
domestic application and thus made from the natural zeolites available in the country. 
3.4.1 Design of simple household treatment system. 
The estimated output of the spring water was expected to fit in the limit of the 
household zeolite adsorption column design. The best height of the zeolite in the test 
column was determined to be 30cm through initial experimentation to establish the 
correct time for the removal of Pb²⁺ and Cu²⁺ ions. 
The method that was applied in determining the speed of the spring water was a basic 
timing technique. The bottle was dropped to fall through a known distance of 50m and 
the time taken to fall through the known distance was recorded three times. The 
average velocity (v) was then determined by the equation: 
v = = S/t 
DISTANCE = S 
The discharge/flow rate is derived from; 
 
Q= V × A 
 
Where; 
 
v = velocity 
A = area  
The values measured above were employed to design the domestic zeolite column in 
order to provide an optimal contact area for the efficiency of the Pb²⁺ and Cu²⁺ ions 
while also taking into consideration a reasonable flow rate for domestic applications.

4.0.1 pH 
The pH levels of the raw water from the three springs in Kyabalogo Village recorded a slightest 
variation for the three days of collection (8th, 15th, and 21st September). The pH levels 
ranged from 6.24 to 6.94, and the pH levels are still within the recommended pH levels for 
natural potable water in the Uganda Standard US EAS 12:2014 guidelines, where the pH ranges 
from 5.5 to 9.5. 
The second sampled day, A (protected spring), recorded the lowest average pH value of 6.24, 
followed later by the gradual increase in Spring B (6.82), followed again by a slight decrease 
in Spring C (6.67). All these changes occur due to the natural fluctuating processes in the 
springs, since the springs are fed by groundwater. 
 
The variation in the pH level, according to Zhang et al. (2021), in the short-term periods is 
because of changes in rainfall infiltration, interaction of the groundwater with the surface, 
and biogeochemical reactions in the aquifer. 
The possible increase in pH in Spring B relatively might be a resultant effect of the activities 
conducted by the people believed to be the primary cause of the pH rise. The sampling activity 
period in the area involved observing the number of houses in the area surrounding the spring 
where people wash, bath, and wash the Jerry Can water nearby in the order listed above. The 
activity conducted involves the use of domestic detergents and soap that increase the pH 
levels temporarily when the by-products are discharged into the water in spring sources (Goel 
and Kaur, 2012). The mean values recorded in point A, B, and C were 6.64 ± 0.49, 6.95 ± 0.48, 
and 6.24 ± 0.79 respectively, showing an increase in the pH levels from point A to C in the 
springs studied. 

30 
 
 
 
Figure 5 : Mean pH values for samples of A, B and C 𝑛 = 3. 
4.1 Electrical Conductivity (EC)  
The values for Electrical Conductivity (EC) measured in the three days of sampling also stayed well 
within the maximum limits allowed by the Uganda Standards US EAS 12:2014, at a maximum of 2500 
μS/cm for EC in drinking water. The average values measured for EC rose marginally from Spring A 
(54.87 ± 4.52 μS/cm) to Spring B (57.30 ± 9.99 μS/cm), then marginally fell at Spring C (54.53 ± 3.12 
μS/cm), but the slight increase recorded at Spring B indicates a natural effect and does not form part 
of the source water quality impairment. 
The rise in Spring B is mostly due to human activities surrounding the spring. Various human activities 
such as washing clothes, bathing, jerry-can washing, and motorbike washing, among other domestic 
activities, occur directly near the spring site and contribute greywater characterized by the presence 
of dissolved ions such as phosphates and chlorides present in washing soap and detergent to the spring. 
Various studies carried out earlier have demonstrated that the presence of such chemical compounds

in domestic wastewater is responsible for the rise in the electrical conductivity levels in the 
 spring and ground water sources, as more charged particles are added to the water column (QMUL, 
n.d.). 
Overall, in spite of the slight change in the EC values in Spring B, the levels in the other two springs 
are well below the national standards. This implies that the springs are less affected by the 
contamination due to salinity and that the slight changes are due to the input of grey water in the 
area. 
 
Figure 6: Average values of EC for the three sampling springs points A, B and C 
4.1.1 Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) 
Total Dissolves Solids (TDS) are those total solids in water that pass through a filter with a 
pore size of 2.0 μm (APHA, 1999). 
TDS gives an approximate value of the quality of the groundwater because the total dissolve 
solids affect the turbidity, taste, and conductivity of the water (APHA, 1999). 
For naturally occurring groundwaters, TDS values are mostly due to the dissolution of ions such 
as Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, Na⁺, K⁺, HCO₃⁻, Cl⁻, and trace levels of ions such as Cu²⁺ and Pb²⁺. 

32 
 
The results of the mean TDS concentrations also validate the stability of the springs, with 
Spring A registering an average of 39.51 ± 2.00 mg/L, Spring B registering an average of  43.62 
± 5.06 mg/L, and Spring C registering an average of 41.04 ± 2.77 mg/L. Notably, each average 
is well within the acceptable limit of the US Environmental Assessment Strategy 12:2014 
guideline of 1500 mg/L in drinkable water. The minor variations in the concentrations across 
the springs are understandably a result of the variations in the geology and recharge 
mechanisms but are instead stable and do not pose any issues of salinity to the water sources

4.1.2 Heavy metal concentrations (Cu and Pb) 
The results of the analysis of the levels of Copper (Cu) and Lead (Pb) released from the 
sampled springs on the 8th, 15th, and 21st of September clearly indicated the presence of 
spatial variation across the area studied. The maximum permissible limits of Cu and Pb in 
drinking water according to the Uganda Standard for Drinking Water Quality US EAS 12:2014 
are given by 1.0 mg/L and 0.01 mg/L, respectively.

When taking into consideration the total number of sampling periods, the lowest levels of both 
metals in Spring A (protected spring) are observed. For the Copper level, the values fluctuated 
from 0.65 to 0.82 mg/L, while the average value reached 0.73 mg/L, while the Lead ranged 
from 0.006 to 0.009 mg/L, with a mean of 0.006 mg/L. The average concentration of the 
analyzed metals is wthin the limits of the safe concentration of drinking water specified by 
the US EAS 12:2014 standard, indicating that spring A is safe from contamination. Even though 
the concentration of the heavy metals is not alarming, the fact that they are present suggests 

34 
 
that the ‘protected’ spring is not completely insulated from the effects of environmental 
factors such as surface runoff.  
The spring with the highest concentrations of metals came from Spring B. The results in the 
analysis illustrate that the levels of Copper ranged from 1.10 to 1.30 mg/L while the average 
value is approximately 1.2 mg/L, and Lead was ranging from 0.20 to 0.24 mg/L with an average 
of 0.20 mg/L. The concentrations of both Cu and Pb in Spring B and C exceeded the 
recommended levels for safe drinking water. The substantially high concentrations of the two 
metals in Spring B could be linked to the uncontrolled human activities taking place in and 
around the source such as bathing, washing clothes, washing cars/bodas, and drainage from 
the settlements that form the spring surroundings, thus resulting in the scattering of the 
metal-containing sediments and dust into the springs. 
 
The Spring C recorded a moderate to high level of metal content characterized by the presence 
of Copper at a level of 0.99 to 1.34 mg/L (approx. 1.2 mg/L) and Lead at a concentration of 
0.19 to 0.22 mg/L (approx. 0.20 mg/L). However, this was still lower than the recorded 
concentrations in Spring B but higher than the permissible levels. The slight drop in the values 
recorded on the final day might be attributed to dilution and incorrect calibration. The water 
from the two Springs is also harmful for human consumption but only safe after treatment.

The resulting effect on the pH of the spring water samples, following treatment with the natural 
and modified zeolite beds of varying depths, was a marked increase in pH values due to the 
chemical composition and interaction of zeolite minerals and the spring water. The 
exchangeable alkaline earth elements in zeolites include calcium, magnesium, sodium, and 
potassium, which migrate to the water in the process of ion exchange. The replacement of the 
hydrogen ions in the water with the weakly alkaline ions resulted in an increase in pH values, 
an effect that was accelerated by the size of the zeolite bed in contact with the water. 
The first treatment phase was represented by the sample taken on 8th September, with a pH 
value of 6.58 ± 0.10. Upon treatment with a 10 cm layer of natural zeolite on 10th October, the 
pH rose to 6.98 ± 0.12. This is typical for natural zeolite media, whose relatively low number of 
active binding sites and relatively low surface activity make them less effective than modified 
zeolites. Also, the short contact time of two minutes in this treatment was a factor in the 
moderate ion exchange and slight neutralization of the slightly acidic raw water sample. 
Higher pH increase was recorded in the second stage, where the sample collected on the 15th 
September (raw pH value of 6.62 ± 0.12) received treatment on the 16th October with a bed of 
modified zeolite measuring 20 cm in height. The pH of the treated water increased to 7.32 ± 
0.15, showing a higher buffering capacity. Surface modification is known to improve the ion 
exchange capacity of zeolite by accentuating the surface functional groups, pore volume, and 
the availability of active adsorption sites. The deeper bed and the larger contact time of five 
minutes gave a higher chance of hydrogen ion exchange with the alkaline cations, resulting in 
higher pH levels than in the natural zeolite sample processed in a shallow bed. 
The last treatment process, applied to the sample of the 21st September (raw pH of 6.65 ± 
0.11), performed on the 23rd of October, consisted of a modified zeolite with a bed height of 

37 
 
30 cm and an extended contact time of approximately ten minutes. It produced the highest pH 
value in the treated solution, averaging 7.52 ± 0.18 at a depth where the higher quantity of 
zeolite present, along with its larger surface area and longer interaction time with the water, 
enabled the maximum utilization of the ion-exchange capacity of the modified zeolite. The pH 
of the resultant effluent shows a considerable neutralization process, resulting in an optimally 
well-buffered pH suitable for drinking quality.

4.2.2 Electro Conductivity 
The Electrical Conductivity (EC) of the raw groundwater samples taken from the springs on the 
8th, 15th, and 21st of September ranged from 54 to 57 μS/cm, with Spring B recording higher 
amounts because of the grey water discharge from bathing, washing, and motorbike washing 
practices. The EC value of the water reduced systematically following the treatment process 

38 
 
involving natural and modified zeolite beds of various depths, representing the process where 
the ions in solution are removed through adsorption and ion exchange processes. The modified 
zeolite has a high cation exchange capacity, making it capable of removing ions such as Na⁺, 
Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, and trace amounts of heavy metals responsible for the conductivity in the water. 
For the 8th September samples, following treatment on the 10th of October with a 10 cm bed 
of natural zeolite and a contact period of approximately two minutes, EC reduced slightly from 
the raw levels (54.9-57.3 µS/cm) to an average treatment value of 50-52 µS/cm. For the 15th 
September samples, treatment on the 16th of October with a 20 cm bed of modified zeolite and 
an average contact period of five minutes resulted in a considerable decrease in EC from the 
raw levels to an average treatment value of 44-47 µS/cm in the springs. The maximum decrease 
in EC was measured in the 21st September samples treated on the 23rd of October with a 30 cm 
bed of modified zeolite and an average contact period of ten minutes, resulting in EC values 
ranging from 40-42 µS/cm. This depicts the highest level of efficiency in the removal of dissolved 
ions.
