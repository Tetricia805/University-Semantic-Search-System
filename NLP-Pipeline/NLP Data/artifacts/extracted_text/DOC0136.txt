ABSTRACT  
This paper investigated the potential of the bio-enzyme and pineapple leaf fiber 
combination as stabilizers for the clay bricks to decrease the carbon emission firewood 
the usual material used in the firing process. We present a study covering the 
effectiveness of the hybrid bio-enzyme (Terrazyme) mixtures with Pineapple Leaf Fiber 
(PALF) in clay bricks as a detailed description. The results of the field tests performed 
in Siron clay bricks provided evidence that the use of the new material not only 
decreases the environmental impact but also improves the strength and water 
absorption of the brick itself. Which in turn contributes to the construction of the eco-
friendly and sustainable building brick.

CHAPTER ONE 
1.1 
INTRODUCTION 
The construction sector is an economic stimulant but is no less a source of ecological 
degradation. The extensive application of firewood in Ugandan bricks is directly 
responsible for carbon accumulation and deforestation. As demands for green building 
materials rise, innovative ways to stabilizing bricks have to do to lessen the effects on 
the environment by regular bricks. 
Clay bricks, in Uganda, omnipresent for their strength and insulating ability, can 
completely be exploited by subjecting them to stabilization treatments to convert them 
to mechanically reinforced and environment-safe bricks. Studies in recent decades 
have revealed extensive opportunities for application of bio-enzyme technology in 
quality improvement of clay bricks. In their natural forms, bio-enzymes, microbially 
produced catalysts, have revealed opportunities to catalyze reactions to improve 
bonding quality of clay in combinations with traditional stabilizers such as cement and 
lime. 
In addition, fibers such as natural fibers made of pineapple leaf fibers (PALF) have found 
attention for their ability to strengthen construction materials. PALF is widely available 
in Uganda, and its utilization in clay bricks would be a sustainable alternative to the 
limitations provided by traditional stabilization techniques. This study seeks to explore 
the synergetic effects of pineapple leaf fiber and bio-enzyme on the stabilization of 
clay bricks in terms of their mechanical strengths, durability, and eco-sustainability. 
 

11  
  
1.2 
BACKGROUND  
Uganda, like most developing nations, is faced with an acute shortage of housing 
resulting from urbanization and population growth. Clay bricks are among the most 
widely used construction materials for building in both urban and rural areas because 
they are readily available and affordable. In regions like Kapchorwa, production of clay 
bricks is normally on a small scale from locally available clay of high plasticity that 
requires stabilization to enhance strength and durability. Nevertheless, the 
conventional technique of clay brick firing using firewood is not just energy-consuming 
but also causing serious environmental concerns. The practice is leading to 
deforestation, which is resulting in biodiversity loss, soil erosion, and carbon dioxide 
emission in the environment. Research indicated that the forest cover in Uganda is 
diminishing at a rate of 1.8% per year, and the majority of the loss is due to fuelwood 
harvesting for brick kilns (Bodipo-Memba et al., 2022). High plasticity clays, which 
occur in districts like Kapchorwa, pose further problems. These soils, which have a high 
montmorillonite content, swell when wet and shrink when dry, making structures 
constructed from them without stabilization vulnerable to instability. While fired 
bricks, by making available better compressive strength, alleviate this challenge, they 
are high in environmental as well as economic kiln cost. Other types of stabilization, 
and especially those minimizing the use of firewood, are thus sorely required. 
Pineapple leaf fiber (PALF) is an abundant agricultural residue in Uganda, particularly 
in areas where the cultivation of pineapple is widespread like Kayunga, Luwero and 
Mukono. 

12  
  
Pineapple leaves are presently disposed of as waste during pruning. Nevertheless, the 
study reveals that PALF has superior tensile strength and binding qualities and can be 
utilized as reinforcement material in building construction (Razman et al., 2024). By 
integrating bio-enzyme stabilization techniques with PALF, the present research seeks 
to investigate an eco-friendly alternative that not only mitigates the issues of plasticity 
in clay soil but also minimizes environmental degradation linked to conventional brick-
making processes. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

13  
  
1.3 PROBLEM STATEMENT  
The traditional clay brick production in Uganda relies heavily on firewood, and as such, 
it results in tremendous deforestation and greenhouse emissions. Firewood fuels over 
70% of the energy used in the brick kiln and results in the burning of approximately 
92,000 hectares of forest cover annually (Bodipo-Memba et al., 2022). The process is 
unsustainable and poses a risk to Uganda's natural resources and environmental well-
being. 
In eastern Uganda, Budadiri, Chelel, Mutufu, and Siron are also affected by expansive 
smectite clays (Wasajja-Navoyojo et al., 2016; Mukasa-Tebandeke et al., 2015). The 
clays are highly acidic (0.1-1.85 mol/g) relative to kaolinite clays from central Uganda 
(Mukasa-Tebandeke et al., 2014). The characteristics, such as enormous chemically 
active surface areas, influence water absorption and liquid flow behavior (Odom, 1984). 
Cement and lime are being widely utilized as stabilizers but are energy-intensive, thus 
causing greenhouse gas emissions. Environmentally friendly alternatives are urgently 
needed. Bio-enzymes, i.e., Terrazyme, have the potential to enhance compressive 
strength and reduce permeability via stable clay aggregates formation (Saini & 
Vaishnava, 2015). This study suggests mixing bio-enzymes with pineapple leaf fibers for 
the development of a hybrid stabilization method that reduces the environmental 
impact of brick manufacturing. 
 
 

14  
  
1.4 MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY  
To assess the use of a bio-enzyme and pineapple leaf fibers as a stabilizer in clay bricks.  
1.5 SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES  
1. To determine the soil properties of the clay brick.  
2. To determine the physical properties of pineapple leaf fibers.  
3. To evaluate the engineering properties of stabilized clay bricks and identify the 
optimal ratio for the mix.  
1.6 RESEARCH QUESTIONS  
1. What are the soil properties of the clay brick?  
2. What are the physical properties of pineapple leaf fibers?  
3. What are the engineering properties of a bio-enzyme and pineapple leaf fiber-
stabilized clay bricks and the optimal ratio for the mix?  
1.7 JUSTIFICATION  
In Siron Village, located in Kirwoko Parish, Kaptanya Subcounty, Kapchorwa District, 
clay soils primarily consist of Montmorillonite, which has a high cation exchange 
capacity. This leads to significant swelling as the clay absorbs large amounts of water, 
increasing its volume. 
Bio-enzymes like Terrazyme, an organic and non-toxic formulation derived from the 
fermentation of fruit and vegetable waste, enhance soil engineering properties. 
Terrazyme catalyzes reactions between clay particles and organic cations, reducing 
water absorption and increasing compaction (Shah, 2017; Suresh, 2017). Studies 

15  
  
indicate improvements in the California Bearing Ratio (CBR) values of treated soil, with 
optimal results typically at 0.5 ml per 100 ml of water (Suresh, 2017; Panchal, 2017). 
This treatment enhances soil strength and can reduce pavement thickness, potentially 
saving up to 30% in road construction costs (Suresh, 2017). 
Pineapple leaf fibers (PALF) also show promise as reinforcement in clay and earth 
bricks, demonstrating tensile strength ranging from 16.71 MPa to 76.47 MPa, with 
optimal fiber loading (Kasim et al., 2015; Odusote & Kumar, 2016; Susilowati & 
Sumardiyanto, 2018). 
 
 
1.8 SCOPE  
This research will focus on the clay found in Siron Village, in Kirwoko Parish, Kaptanya 
Subcounty, Kapchorwa District, Uganda. It will focus on assessing the physical 
properties of the pineapple leaf fibers, determining their optimal mix for brick 
stabilization, and evaluating the resulting bricks' engineering properties. The study will 
involve laboratory testing of bricks stabilized with varying ratios of bio-enzyme and 
pineapple leaf fiber.

CHAPTER TWO: LITERATURE REVIEW 
2.1 CLAY SOILS 
Clay soils comprise fine grains composed of clay minerals whose grain is below 2 
micrometers. The soils exhibit good plasticity, cation exchange ability (CEC), and 
holding of water and thus their application is vital in agricultural, civil engineering, and 
in environment application in Mukono and in Ugandans' eastern regions. 
Clay soils have three classes, such as illite, smectite, and kaolinite. Smectite soils have 
good swelling and good cation-exchanging property, but good for agricultural moisture 
and bad for building, in case of ground instability. The illite soils have average shrink-
shrink and in building, while for low plasticity and strength, kaolinite is valued and 
good for bricks and for ceramic industry (Belghazdis & Hachem, 2022; Mukasa-
Tebandeke et al., 2022). 
2.2  PROPERTIES OF SMECITE 
Smectite clays have good cation-exchanging capacities, and such capacities are 
desirable for agricultural application in water scarcity soils (Keren, 2021). Such 
capacities are desirable for agricultural application in water scarcity. The plasticity is, 
however, challenging to handle in construction. The illite clays, however, have average 
plasticity and low shrink-swelling, and such is desirable for application in building, for 
example, in bricks' manufacture. Kaolinite is desirable for strength and stability under 
high-temperature, something desirable in strong bricks' and tiles' manufacture (Dixon, 
2022). 

17  
  
2.3 CLAY BRICKS 
Clay bricks are materials for construction made through molding clay and subjecting 
them to kilning. In Uganda, their standard measurement is 200mm in length, 100mm in 
breadth, and 75mm in thickness. The bricks have various applications, including load 
walls and foundations. The locally produced clay bricks have been used for housing and 
building on a large scale, and offered an inexpensive and renewable source, in most 
rural societies where there is adequate clay (Ifurueze et al., 2018). 
2.4 STABILIZATION 
Stabilization refers to any treatment to improve physical quality of building materials, 
for instance, soils like clay, to make them resistant and to ensure them to function 
properly. Stabilization is made up of addition of stabilizers like cement, cement, or bio-
enzymes, to which stabilizers have to undergo chemical reaction to soils or materials, 
to limit their plasticity, to strengthen them, and to protect them against deformation 
under impact of such natural components such as water and shrinkage. 
2.4.1 Chemical Stabilization 
Chemical stabilization is made possible through stabilizers such as cement and lime in 
clay soils to improve their engineering behavior. Stabilizers cement and cement in 
Uganda have been largely employed. Stabilizer's calcium ions bind to clay minerals to 
form cementitious compounds, thus increased compressive strength and durability in 
clay bricks (Riza et al., 2011). Fly ash, combustion residue of coal, is also discovered 
to be used in stabilizing in various regions, posing an available low-impact solution. 

18  
  
2.4.2 Mechanical Stabilization 
Mechanical stabilization compresses the mixture of clay to compact void space and to 
ensure optimal density. The process strengthens and makes bricks moisture and natural 
effects resistant. Mechanism is oftentimes employed in Ugandan commercial bricks to 
ensure standard shapes and dimensions (Firoozi et al., 2017). 
2.5 BIO-ENZYMES 
Bio-enzymes are natural, organic compounds produced by fermenting plant materials 
including fruit, vegetable, or cane. In their role as stabilizers, bio-enzymes in stabilizing 
soils modify physical and chemical states of soils, stabilizing, compacting, and 
strengthening them to sustain load. As an organic, green cement or lime stabilizers' 
substitute, bio-enzymes have low carbon footprints and low ecological impact (Sathish 
et al., 2021). 
2.6 Terrazyme as one of the bio enzymes for stabilization 
Terrazyme is a commonly used organic liquid enzyme in soil stabilization and soil 
improvement, made of different vegetable and fruit extracts. Terrazyme positively 
changes the California Bearing Ratio (CBR) and enhances soil strength while decreasing 
the Optimum Moisture Content (OMC) and plasticity index (Ikeagwuani, & Nwonu, 
2019).  
As the water is removed from the soil, the soil particles (mostly clay) have a greater 
capacity to exchange cations, resulting in increased friction (Agarwal & Kaur, 2018). 
The Terrazyme coats the clay particles to make them moisture resistant, which 

19  
  
ultimately results in a higher long-term stabilizing effect and biodegradability (Jain & 
Sharma, 2020).  
Terrazyme is a dark brown liquid that dissolves in water and has a sweet molasses smell. 
It is not an eye irritant, and personal protective equipment (i.e. masks and gloves) is 
not required (Kumar et al., 2021).  
Terrazyme must be dosed correctly; under-dosing will have ineffective stabilization, 
and over-dosing is an unwanted expense without added benefit (Onah et al., 2022). 
Terrazyme can be dosed appropriately by performing a California Bearing Ratio (CBR) 
test with soil samples mixed with varying concentrations of Terrazyme to conclude the 
optimal dosage for stabilization (Ikeagwuani & Nwonu 2019).

2.6.1 Mechanism of bio-enzyme stabilization 
Bio-enzymes can have a positive impact on the stability of soil through the alteration 
in soil grain arrangements. In soils with a high clay content, the enzymes can assist in 
re-aggregation of clay particles from de-aggregation of organic matter, allowing certain 
chemical reactions to occur that facilitate the decomposition of water-clay bonds 

21  
  
(Ikeagwuani & Nwonu, 2019). The outcome of these actions reduces the swelling-
shrinkage behavior of expansive clays and enhances solidification of the soil (Agarwal 
& Kaur, 2018). The stabilization process includes: Cation exchange reducing clays 
plasticity through the replacement of the absorbable water molecule with stabilizing 
ions (Jain & Sharma, 2020). 
2.6.2 Promote cation exchange 
Bio-enzymes facilitate cation replacement between clay minerals in such a manner in 
which calcium and magnesium ions replace sodium ions in clay structure. The cation 
replacement lowers electrostatic repellency between clay materials, and thus, forms 
denser and stable structure in soils (Narain et al., 2020). 
2.6.3 Reduce plasticity 
Bio-enzymes significantly constrain plasticity index of the soil, and swelling and water-
absorbing ability is compromised. The consequence is to render the soil impermeable 
to water deterioration and, therefore, wet durability is enhanced (Sathish et al., 2021). 
2.7 Natural fibers (Pineapple Leaf Fiber) 
Pineapple leaf fibers consist of plant leaves Ananas comosus. The plant is renewable 
resource and green in accordance to their degradable and renewable property and their 
available by-product in agricultural industry (Behera et al., 2019). The pine leaf fibers 
have good extension strength resistance and good strength in building materials, in 
composites and earth stabilizers.

CHAPTER THREE: METHODOLOGY 
3.1 To determine the soil properties of the clay bric 
3.1.1 Particle Size Distribution 
3.1.1.1 Sieve Analysis  
This method evaluated soils with particle sizes ranging from gravel to fine sand. The 
detailed procedure was as follows. 
Materials required. 
• 
A set of sieves with appropriate aperture sizes, typically ranging from 63 mm to 
63 µm, depending on the soil sample. 
• 
Mechanical sieve shaker to facilitate consistent sieving. 
• 
Balance readable to 0.01 g for precise measurements. 
• 
Drying oven capable of maintaining temperatures between 105°C and 110°C. 
• 
Metal trays for handling soil samples. 
• 
Sieve brushes for cleaning sieves. 
• 
Sieve analysis worksheet for recording data. 
Sample Preparation. The soil sample was Placed in a dried to remove moisture. After 
drying, it was weighed accurately, m0. 
The sieves were arranged in descending order of aperture size, from largest to smallest, 
ensuring each sieve was clean and undamaged. And place the dried soil sample onto 
the top sieve of 63mm. 

23  
  
Secured the sieve stack in the mechanical sieve shaker and operated it for a standard 
duration, typically 10 to 15 minutes, to ensure thorough separation of particle sizes. 
After sieving, carefully removed each sieve, starting from the top, and weighed the soil 
retained on each sieve separately. 
Noted the mass of soil retained on each sieve and calculated the percentage retained 
relative to the total sample mass. 
Determined the cumulative percentage passing each sieve size by subtracting the 
cumulative percentage retained from 100%. 
Plotted the cumulative percentage passing against the corresponding sieve sizes on 
semi-logarithmic graph paper to produce the particle size distribution curve, which aids 
in soil classification and assessment. 
 
3.1.2 Atterberg Limits Test (Plastic Limit, Liquid Limit, and Plasticity Index) 
The Atterberg Limits (Liquid Limit, Plastic Limit, and Plasticity Index) were determined 
in accordance with British Standard BS 1377-2:1990. These tests classify fine-grained 
soils based on their consistency and plasticity. ‘ 
Liquid Limit (LL) – Cone Penetrometer Method (BS 1377-2:1990, Clause 4.3) 
This method determined the moisture content at which a soil transitions from a liquid 
to a plastic state. 
Materials Required: 
• Cone penetrometer (30° cone, 80g ± 0.5g total mass). 

24  
  
• Penetration measurement device. 
• Mixing tools (spatula, glass plate). 
• 425 µm sieve. 
• Moisture content containers. 
• Oven and balance (readable to 0.01 g). 
• Distilled water. 
Procedure 
The soil sample was air-dried and sieved through a 425 µm sieve. 
The sieved soil was mixed with distilled water to form a smooth, homogeneous paste. 
The soil paste was placed in the penetrometer cup, and the surface was leveled. 
The cone was lowered until it just touched the soil surface, and it was then released 
for 5 seconds. 
The penetration depth of the cone into the soil was measured. 
The moisture content of the soil was adjusted, and the process was repeated to obtain 
at least four penetration readings bracketing 20 mm. 
The penetration depth (mm) was plotted against the moisture content (%) on a graph. 
The Liquid Limit (LL) was the moisture content corresponding to 20 mm penetration, 
interpolated from the flow curve. 
 
 

25  
  
Plastic Limit (PL) (BS 1377-2:1990, Clause 5.3) 
This method determined the moisture content at which a soil transitions from a plastic 
to a semi-solid state. 
Materials Required: 
Glass plate. 
3 mm rolling rods. 
425 µm sieve. 
Moisture content containers. 
Oven and balance (readable to 0.01 g). 
Distilled water. 
Procedure 
Use approximately 20 g of soil that had passed through a 425 µm sieve. 
The soil was mixed with distilled water to form a stiff, plastic paste. 
The soil paste was rolled into a 3 mm diameter thread on the glass plate. 
If the thread crumbled at 3 mm diameter, the crumbled soil was collected for moisture 
content determination. 
The process was repeated until consistent crumbling occurred at 3 mm diameter. 
The moisture content of the crumbled soil was determined. 
The results of two trials were averaged to obtain the Plastic Limit (PL). 

26  
  
Plasticity index (PI) 
The difference between the liquid limit and the plastic limit was calculated as the 
plasticity index. 
PI = LL – PL (as a percentage) 
 
3.1.3 The X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) 
This test was performed to evaluate the chemical composition of clay soil in accordance 
with ASTM D5381-93 (2021). The clay soil sample was left to air dry, ground to pass 
through a 75-micron sieve, and weighed (15g), then placed in a plastic sample cup with 
a support film to establish a flat surface for scanning. 
The sample was compacted and area crushed for homogeneous distribution. 
Standardized reference materials were utilized to calibrate the XRF spectrometer. 
The sample was placed into the spectrometer, and an X-ray beam was directed at the 
surface of the sample while the fluorescence emissions were recorded and analyzed. 
The XRF assessment provided quantitative data on the percent archaeometric 
compositions of the significant oxides of SiO₂, Al₂O₃, Fe₂O₃, CaO, MgO, Na₂O and K₂O 
oxides found in the clay soil. The reported values could then be used to evaluate the 
soil material for engineering purposes.  
The protocols for preparation were strictly followed so accurate results would be 
obtained. The X-ray fluorescence test will display reliable results for chemical analysis 
of clay soil. Proper sample preparation, calibration, and positioning provided accurate 

27  
  
results in support of decisions such as: soil stabilization, construction material 
selection, and geotechnical applications. 
 
3.1.4 Free Swell Index (FSI) Test 
The free swell test, using the USBR (United States Bureau of Reclamation) method, 
determined the potential for a soil to swell when exposed to water by measuring the 
increase in volume of a soil sample after it was immersed in water. This method was 
developed by Holtz and Gibbs (1956) and was used to assess soil expansivity. 
Free swell ratio was defined as the ratio of the equilibrium sediment volume of a 10 g 
oven-dried soil sample that had passed through a 425 μm sieve and was placed in a 100 
ml graduated measuring jar containing distilled water, to that in kerosene, after an 
equilibration period of a minimum of 24 hours. 
This test was used to check volume expansion in water in soils, which was crucial in 
identifying swelling soils. The swelling property was significant in testing stabilization 
treatments.

CHAPTER FOUR: RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
This chapter discusses and examines the findings from several test results of the 
materials tested and compared to the existing requirements. These tests included those 
carried out on the existing bricks and soils and the stabilized bricks. The tests include; 
strength test, water absorption test, the Atterberg limits test and the free swell index 
test. 
 
4.1 Objective one: Determining the soil properties of the clay brick. 
The soils were analyzed at the Stirling Laboratory in Malaba, Mukono, after being 
collected from Siron village, Kapchorwa District. The soil was greyish in color and 
several tests were carried out on it and these include; particle size distribution, 
Atterberg tests, free swell Index. The strength and water absorption of the site bricks 
were also tested and these were carried out on both the fired and unfired bricks.

Figure 1 Particle size Distribution 
 
The results indicated that the coarser fractions (sand-sized particles) are minimal, with 
only 1% retained on the 4.75 mm sieve while, a large portion (80%) of the sample is 
finer than 0.075 mm, which means the sample is mostly fine-grained material and based 
on BS 1377-2:1990, soils with a high percentage of fine particles are typically clayey 
silts or clays. This confirms that the soil is predominantly a fine-grained material, likely 
clayey soil, which aligns with the project’s focus on stabilizing clay bricks. 
 
4.1.2 Atterberg Limits test on the clay soil sample 
The Atterberg Limits—Liquid Limit (LL), Plastic Limit (PL), and Plasticity Index (PI)—are 
critical indicators of the engineering behavior of fine-grained soils, particularly their 
response to moisture changes. The results for the clay soil from Siron Village, Uganda, 
are as follows:

Liquid Limit (LL): 57.6% 
Plastic Limit (PL): 27.6% 
Plasticity Index (PI): 30.0% 
 
Liquid Limit (LL) 
The LL of 57.6% signifies the soil’s high water-holding capacity, characteristic of 
montmorillonite-rich clays. At this moisture content, the soil transitions from a plastic 
to a liquid state. Such a high LL suggests that the soil is prone to significant volume 
expansion when saturated, making it unsuitable for construction without stabilization. 
Montmorillonite’s layered structure and high cation exchange capacity (CEC) 
exacerbate this behavior, as water molecules infiltrate the mineral layers, causing 
swelling. 
Plastic Limit (PL): 
The PL of 27.6% represents the moisture content below which the soil becomes brittle 
and cracks under stress. While this value is moderate compared to highly organic soils, 
it underscores the soil’s sensitivity to drying. During brick production, maintaining 
moisture slightly above the PL is essential to ensure workability. However, exceeding 
this threshold risks deformation, while under-drying leads to brittleness. 
Plasticity Index (PI): 
The PI (LL − PL = 30.0%) categorizes the soil as highly plastic (PI > 25%). According to 
the Unified Soil Classification System (USCS), this soil falls under CH (high-plasticity 

38  
  
clay). High PI soils exhibit pronounced shrink-swell behavior, expanding when wet and 
contracting when dry. The PI (30%) aligns with studies on Ugandan montmorillonite 
clays, which report PI values of 25–35% (Mukasa-Tebandeke et al., 2022). 
 
USCS classification Chart 
The Unified Soil Classification System (USCS) classifies soils based on their particle size 
distribution and plasticity characteristics. Based on the results archieved, the soil 
sample can be classified as follows:

39  
  
Grain Size Distribution Analysis: 
o 80% of the soil passes through the 0.075 mm sieve, indicating that it is a 
fine-grained soil. 
o According to the USCS, soils with more than 50% passing through the 0.075 
mm sieve are classified as fine-grained soils (silts or clays). 
Plasticity Analysis: 
o Liquid Limit (LL) = 57.6% 
o Plasticity Index (PI) = 30.0% 
o According to the USCS classification: 
▪ 
If LL > 50%, the soil is classified as high plasticity. 
▪ 
A PI of 30% confirms that the soil exhibits high plasticity, meaning 
it undergoes significant volume changes with moisture variation.

4.1.3 XRF test of the clay soil 
The X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) analysis provides a chemical composition of Siron clay, 
which is compared with Illite and Montmorillonite clay standards. This comparison helps 
in classifying the soil type and understanding its behavior in engineering applications.

Comparison of Siron Clay (XRF Results) to Illite and Montmorillonite Clay Standards 
To assess the characteristics of the clay soil from Siron, Kapchorwa District, a 
comparison on its chemical composition was made to the standard compositions of Illite 
and Montmorillonite clays. This helped determine which category it closely aligns with 
and how it influences the stabilization and engineering behavior of the soil. 
Key Observations & Comparisons 
1. Silica (SiO₂) Content 
Siron Clay: 48.27% 
Illite Range: 50–60% 

42  
  
Montmorillonite Range: 55–65%  
▪ Siron clay has slightly lower silica content than Illite and Montmorillonite, 
meaning it may have lower resistance to shrinkage and expansion. 
2. Aluminum Oxide (Al₂O₃) Content 
Siron Clay: 20.53% 
Illite Range: 15–25% 
Montmorillonite Range: 20–30% 
▪ Siron clay matches closely with Montmorillonite in Al₂O₃ content, suggesting it 
has good plasticity but potential shrink-swell issues. 
3. Iron Oxide (Fe₂O₃) Content 
Siron Clay: 10.18% 
Illite Range: 4–8% 
Montmorillonite Range: 2–5% 
▪ Siron clay has much higher Fe₂O₃ than both Illite and Montmorillonite. This 
means it will produce reddish bricks when fired but may also be more brittle 
than Montmorillonite clays. 
4. Calcium Oxide (CaO) Content 
Siron Clay: 7.32% 
Illite Range: 0–3% 
Montmorillonite Range: 1–5% 

43  
  
▪ Siron clay has significantly higher CaO, closer to Montmorillonite, making it 
more self-stabilizing but prone to lime popping (expansion issues). 
5. Magnesium Oxide (MgO) Content 
Siron Clay: 4.22% 
Illite Range: 1–3% 
Montmorillonite Range: 3–10% 
▪ Siron clay has MgO within the Montmorillonite range, meaning it has some self-
hardening properties but not as much as high-MgO Montmorillonite. And  also 
contributes to the swelling potential of the clay. 
6. Potassium Oxide (K₂O) Content 
Siron Clay: 3.56% 
Illite Range: 3–7% 
Montmorillonite Range: 0.5–3% 
▪ Siron clay is similar to Illite in K₂O content, meaning it may have some 
resistance to chemical weathering and high-temperature durability. 
7. Sodium Oxide (Na₂O) Content 
Siron Clay: 2.87% 
Illite Range: 0.5–2% 
Montmorillonite Range: 1–4% 
▪ The Na₂O content in Siron clay is greater than that in Montmorillonite, 
meaning it is responsible for the swelling potential in this clay. 

44  
  
4.1.4 Free Swell Index (FSI) Test (BS 1377-2:1990)  
FSI = 85.41% which was quite high and it occurs due to high presence of sodium ions, 
Magnesium ions primarily. This means the clay soil swells when wet and shrinks when 
dry. 
How swelling occurs; 
• 
Montmorillonite has weak Van der Waals forces and cation exchange sites (Na⁺, 
and Mg²⁺) that attract water molecules, leading to interlayer expansion. 
• 
Illite swells moderately because its interlayers contain K⁺ ions, which hold the 
structure but allow slight expansion. 
Thus, high FSI values suggest the presence of Montmorillonite, while low values indicate 
Kaolinite-dominant soil. 
Table 3 Standard Classification of Swelling Potential (as per IS 1498-1970 & Literature Studies)

The value of 85.41% is high and could have adverse effects if the caly soil is utilized 
without a form of stabilization.

4.1.5 The compressive strength test 
The compressive strength test evaluates the ability of bricks to withstand axial loads, 
which is crucial in determining their structural applicability. The results for the Siron 
clay bricks are compared against the BS EN 772-1:2011 and BS EN 771-1 standards, as 
shown in the table below:

(BS EN 771-1)

Fired bricks (3.9 MPa vs. 5 MPa Standard) 
The fired bricks from the case study had an average compressive strength of 3.9 MPa, 
which is considerably lower than the 5MPa compressive strength set as a threshold by 
BS EN 772-1:2011 for loadbearing walls.  
Fired bricks from the case study could be appropriate for a non-load bearing application 
(e.g., partition walls), but in other applications for load-bearing mortar with a gross 

46  
  
over-design will raise the safe load-bearing capacities of these bricks, possibly 
rendering them suitable with other allowances of safety values.  
Fired bricks that do not structurally qualify as load bearing can be acceptable for walls 
or foundations with reinforcement, but the lack of strength for broader or unlimited 
use must be established for any particular circumstance.  
The lower strength may have multiple sources, such as: 
• Clay mineral composition: Higher proportions of smectite or montmorillonite 
may yield higher shrinkage and cracking when fired too thoroughly. 
• Firing conditions: If the kiln temperature to not achieve a high enough 
temperature (850 to 1100°C for fired bricks), then the dissipation of heat may 
leave the bricks incompletely sintered with badly weak inter-particle bonding. 
• Pore structure: If the clay is not adequately compacted before firing they may 
have too much porosity leading to lower strength. 
Unfired bricks (1.7 MPa versus a 2 MPa standard) 
The unfired bricks registered an average compressive strength of 1.7 MPa which is lower 
than the 2 MPa minimum required by British Standards, BS EN 771-1, for non-fired load-
bearing units, meaning that unfired bricks are structurally weak for any load-bearing 
applications without additional stabilization. 
The expected low strength of the unfired bricks is due to: 
• Lack of sintering: Unlike fired bricks, unfired bricks are air-dried, 
which leads to a higher level of porosity and weak particle cohesion. 

47  
  
• Plasticity of clay: The high plasticity index (30%) indicates that the 
clay has a high shrink-swell potential that is detrimental to strength. 
• No stabilizers: Lime, cement or bio-enzymes could help improve the 
compressive strength of the unfired bricks. The Siron fired bricks (3.9 
MPa) and unfired bricks (1.7 MPa) tested are not representative of the 
minimum for BS EN 772-1:2011 and BS EN 771-1 (non-fired) standards 
respectively.  
Further improvements to firing conditions, stabilization of the clay, and compaction of 
the bricks are necessary to improve the quality of the material for structural 
applications. 
 
4.1.6 Water Absorption Test 
The Water Absorption Test is an important measure of the durability, porosity and 
resistance to moisture penetration of a brick. It simply measures the amount of water 
a brick can absorb when immersed in water for a period of time (normally 24 hours) 
expressed as a percentage of its dry weight. Water Absorption Test results against BS 
standards.

Fired Bricks (7.6) % - Meets BS Standard 
The fired bricks' water absorption of 7.6% is below the BS EN 772-11:2011 standard 
limit of ≤15% therefore, these bricks can be classified as suitable and are sufficiently 
resistant to water for construction purposes. 
The minimal absorption demonstrates a level of sintering took place during the firing 
process, which leads to: 
• Reduced porosity due to fusion of clay particles. 
• Stronger interparticle bonding that reduces water absorption. It falls in line with 
common Ugandan fired bricks, which usually have a water absorption rate of 8–12%.  

49  
  
The Fired Bricks (7.6% water absorption rate), can meet BS EN 772-11:2011 and are 
considered suitable for structural use, however, from a sustainability perspective, we 
need to consider alternate methods of stabilization, as the firing process raises 
environmental concerns: 
• A result of firewood use resulting in deforestation in Uganda (Bodipo-Memba et al., 
2022). 
• Carbon emissions released from the kiln discharge into the environment, thus 
affecting sustainability.  
• Additional methods of stabilization such as bio-enzyme stabilization or 
improvements to the industrial kilns could produce a more environmentally friendly 
policy. 
Unfired Bricks (-14.0%) - Fails BS Standard 
The negative absorption value (-14.0%) reflects the mass lost from the clay brick due 
to structural collapse as opposed to absorption. The brick suffered mass loss due to: 
• Montmorillonite-rich clay swells upwards of 85% in volume due to absorption 
of water into the interlayer spaces, which caused disintegration of the 
compact clay brick after 24 hours. 
• High plasticity index (PI = 30%), indicating high sensitivity to moisture. 
Unfired Bricks (-14.0%) failed BS EN 771-1 entirely due to swelling and disintegration. 
They will require further stabilization with bio-enzymes, lime or cement before they 
can be used practically.

4.2 Objective two: To determine the physical properties of pineapple leaf fibers. 
The Pineapple Leaf Fiber (PALF) Tensile Properties Test evaluated the mechanical 
behavior of the fiber subject to tensile stress. This test examined key properties of the 
fiber, including breaking force, elongation, resistance per kilometer (RKM), breaking 
work, and breaking time, which will determine suitability of the fiber for reinforcement 
materials, composites, and textile uses.
