Abstract 
This study aimed to investigate the relationships between service quality, 
customer loyalty, and customer retention within private healthcare facilities 
in Mbarara City. It specifically focused on how service quality affects cus-
tomer retention and loyalty, and how loyalty in turn influences retention. A 
cross-sectional design was used, with data collection and analysis conducted 
quantitatively. The study encompassed 36 operational private healthcare 
centres, with their customers serving as the subjects of the investigation. 
The study distributed self-administered closed-ended questionnaires to the 
participants, and the data collected was later processed and analysed using 
Statistical Package for Social Scientists (SPSS), version 21. To address the 
research objectives, Pearson correlation was utilized to examine the rela-
tionships between the variables under investigation, while Ordinary Least 
Square regression was employed to assess the model’s predictive capability. 
The study revealed a noteworthy positive relationship between service qual-
ity and customer loyalty, as well as a significant positive correlation be-
tween customer loyalty and customer retention. However, it was deter-
mined that the link between service quality and customer retention was not 
statistically significant. Therefore, there is a need for private healthcare 
management to focus on service quality to improve customer loyalty. This 
means that activities related to the reliability of the health staff, positive re-
sponsiveness of the doctors and other employees in the health centres, en-
suring that the patients are assured of quality service and equipping the 
health facility with the right machines that can test and treat diseases, this 
will help in improving customer loyalty hence customer retention among 
private health care services in Mbarara City.

1. Introduction 
Companies boost their profits through various means, including acquiring new 
customers, increasing the volume of one-time purchases from existing custom-
ers, and prolonging customer retention (Ali et al., 2010). In an intensely com-
petitive business landscape, customer retention is vital to a company’s continued 
existence. This is because the loss of a customer equates to relinquishing the po-
tential future revenue generated by the customer’s lifelong purchases. Further-
more, customer retention brings several advantages, including enhanced em-
ployee retention, higher job satisfaction, improved service quality, reduced costs, 
decreased price sensitivity, and increased productivity, among other benefits 
(Aydin & Özer, 2006). It is important to highlight that acquiring new custom-
ers comes with considerably higher costs than retaining existing customers 
(Osarenkhoe et al., 2017). The more extended a customer maintains their rela-
tionship with a company, the greater the company’s advantages (Shashikala & 
Ashwini, 2015). This result is shaped by various factors and aligns with the idea 
that the expenses associated with acquiring and enticing new customers are sub-
stantial. The expense associated with attracting new customers is five times 
higher than that of retaining existing ones (Rust & Zahorik, 1993). In agreement, 
Tao (2014) asserted that attracting and retaining profitable customers is impor-
tant in businesses today. 
Globally, many firms face challenges in retaining their customer base. For 
example, in the mobile phone industry, customer attrition rates frequently sur-
pass 30% despite the implementation of various strategies aimed at retaining 
customers. Well-known UK mobile network providers Orange, T-Mobile, O2, 
and Vodafone have lost more than one-third of their younger customers to rival 
companies (Andic, 2006). This scenario is not unlike the situation in the Ugan-
dan telecom sector, where, as reported in the Business Market International Re-
port (2017), MTN Uganda maintains a customer base of 11.2 million subscrib-
ers, representing 55 per cent of its market share. Nevertheless, there has been a 
noticeable increase in the number of inactive prepaid users, with mobile cus-
tomers periodically opting to abandon some of their SIM cards. 
Service companies place a significant emphasis on service quality as a critical 
tool for customer retention. In the financial services sector such as banks, com-
petition varies in the market using differentiated products. These services are 
regarded as competitive tool (Nsiah & Mensah, 2014). In other words, the bank-
ing sector attracts customers by offering high-quality services. Similarly, within 
the healthcare sector, service quality encompasses the provision of what patients

desire (patient quality) and what they require (professional quality) while opti-
mizing resource utilization and minimizing errors to ensure their ongoing pa-
tronage (Mosadeghrad, 2014). Previous studies have confirmed the connection 
between service quality and customer retention (Althonayan et al., 2015; Nsiah 
& Mensah, 2014; Saeed et al., 2005; Uslu & Eren, 2020). 
Furthermore, a great deal of research has examined the connection between 
client retention and loyalty (Oliver, 1999). When faced with situational influ-
ences and marketing campaigns that may tempt one to switch, customers who 
exhibit loyalty will repeatedly purchase the same brand or product within the 
same category. This deep commitment to repurchasing a preferred product or 
service in the future is what defines customer loyalty. Thomas and Tobe (2012) 
advocate that “loyalty is more profitable,” since it is significantly more expensive 
to acquire new customers than it is to keep existing ones. In addition to sticking 
with a company, devoted consumers act as brand ambassadors, encouraging 
others to buy from it and make thoughtful choices before looking at other op-
tions. Customer loyalty can be cultivated over time through multiple transac-
tions (Khadka & Maharjan, 2017). 
Private healthcare providers are viewed as more competitive than public 
healthcare providers because they have qualified and competent healthcare pro-
viders. Being the closest to community members, they are the main source of 
health care, thus extending health care services including required medicines 
closer to Ugandans (Martini et al., 2007), and filling gaps where little or no pub-
lic health care is available. Nevertheless, these private healthcare providers have 
struggled to maintain their customer base, as customers appear to be transition-
ing from one healthcare facility to another in search of improved services. 
Customer retention is crucial for businesses, including private healthcare pro-
viders in Mbarara City, where most customers are new and repeat (Ali et al., 
2010). This trend, evidenced by the closure and relocation of health centres such 
as the Rwebikona Clinic and Rubindi Pharmacy in 2020, could lead to more 
closures if not addressed (Ali et al., 2010; Shashikala & Ashwini, 2015). Previous 
studies on customer retention have focused on different sectors and developed 
countries, leaving a knowledge gap in developing countries, such as Uganda. 
This study aims to fill this gap by exploring the relationship between service 
quality, customer loyalty, and customer retention in Mbarara’s private health 
care sector. 
2. Literature Review 
2.1. Customer Retention 
According to Hume et al. (2007), customer retention is characterized by cus-
tomers’ willingness to partake in future interactions with a service provider, en-
compassing the particular nature of these forthcoming interactions. Hume et al. 
(2007) also posit that customer retention is a direct result of consumer attitudes 
and behaviors in response to the services they receive. Essentially, it can be con-

N. Harriet et al.

cluded that the desire to repurchase is rooted in consumers’ willingness to make 
repeat purchases or return to the same organization. 
A company’s customer retention rate is determined by dividing the total 
number of active customers by the proportion of the remaining customers at the 
start of the fiscal year (Ali et al., 2010). Oliver (2014) characterizes customer re-
tention as a robust and long-lasting pledge to regularly repurchase a favoured 
good or service in the future. It encompasses actions taken by a selling organiza-
tion to mitigate customer defects. Successful customer retention efforts com-
mence from the initial interaction a company has with a customer and persist 
throughout the entire duration of the customer relationship. Essentially, cus-
tomer retention focuses on maintaining a business relationship between a sup-
plier and a customer (Duffy, 2003). 
Moreover, the customer retention rate is defined by Buchanan and Gillies 
(1990) as the percentage of consumers who were part of the customer base at the 
beginning of a specific term, such as a year, and who continue to be customers 
after that same period. This metric offers a quantitative measure of a business’s 
ability to retain customers over a specific timeframe. This definition aligns with 
Motiwala (2005), which emphasizes that customer retention entails maintaining 
the current customer base by cultivating positive relationships with individuals 
who purchase a small business’s products or services. The primary goal of cus-
tomer retention is to minimize the loss of profitable customers, aiming for zero 
defects, as outlined by Richards (1996). This signifies sustained commitment 
from both the customer and firm to preserve the relationship. Customer reten-
tion focuses on recurring patronage, which is closely associated with repeat 
purchasing behaviour and brand loyalty (Osarenkhoe et al., 2017). Komunda et 
al. (2015) assert that retained customers are individuals who persistently remain 
loyal to the company. Customer retention dimensions include repeated pur-
chases and referrals to other buyers, where repeated purchases are the continu-
ous purchase of a product or service from the same seller. Referral to other buy-
ers is the act of the existing customer to encourage others to buy from where 
they buy. 
2.2. Service Quality 
Service quality, as defined by Bitner (2018), represents a consumer’s holistic 
judgment of the relative excellence or inferiority of an organization and its ser-
vices. Service quality, as well as quality in a broader sense, is defined as the value 
of a service from the customer’s perspective. The shared elements of service 
quality—reliability, responsiveness, empathy, personalization, competence, dili-
gence, consistency, safety, security, environmental variables, and user inter-
faces—are in line with this viewpoint (Ali, 2021; Ali & Anwar, 2021; Faraj et al., 
2021). 
Recognizing the imperative of achieving customer satisfaction and loyalty 
through the delivery of higher-quality services, Ali et al. (2021), Rajeswari et al. 
(2017), and Shava (2021) emphasize the continuous efforts of service providers.

Highlighting the significance of addressing individual customer needs to en-
hance satisfaction, Bolton and Drew (1991) stress the importance of customized 
services. In various service industries such as telecommunications, the focus is 
increasingly on providing exceptional customer service to maximize satisfaction, 
as noted by Sharma and Jhamb (2017). 
Within the domain of customer service quality, Karatepe (2011) utilized a 
modified SERVQUAL framework and identified network efficiency as the most 
influential factor, whereas staff responsiveness had room for enhancement be-
cause it had the least impact. Al-Aali et al. (2011) added network quality and 
competitive advantage to the SERVQUAL framework, extending it. However, 
Kadasah (2016) evaluated the service quality of several telecom companies using 
SERVQUAL and found that Mobily was the best in all areas of service provision. 
When Bora et al. (2015) included network quality in SERVQUAL in an Indian 
setting, they found a significant and positive correlation between all aspects and 
customer satisfaction. Furthermore, gender differences were observed in the 
evaluation of empathy, responsiveness, and dependability among Indian telecom 
service users. Similarly, SERVQUAL was used by Suguanthi and Shanthi (2017) 
and Sharma and Jhamb (2017) to examine the relationship between customer 
happiness and service quality in India. 
Similarly, Ali et al. (2021) emphasized that concerning service quality, five 
critical dimensions profoundly influence customer satisfaction. Tangibility is 
significant among these dimensions. This is because there exists a connection 
between customers and tangibility, where the tangible aspects of a service draw 
customers’ attention to service quality by aligning the tangible elements associ-
ated with the service provided. Tangibility involves physical presence, hardware, 
staff, and communication materials, all of which contribute to perceptions of 
service quality. 
Reliability involves the consistent and accurate delivery of promised services. 
Customers prefer to interact with businesses or companies that are dependable 
and true of their commitments, particularly concerning service guarantees and 
essential support elements. Customers value and prioritize reliability in any 
business environment (Ali et al., 2021). Responsiveness is another crucial aspect 
that directly impacts customer experience. This dimension relates to the will-
ingness to promptly assist and provide customers with fast service (Ali et al., 
2021). Assurance pertains to confidence and trust in customers. This implies 
that any business or market entity must possess the necessary capabilities to in-
spire customers with a strong sense of confidence and trust (Suguanthi & Shan-
thi, 2017). 
Empathy represents another dimension characterized by two vital compo-
nents: trust and attentive care. Empathy is closely tied to customer attention and 
serves to reassure customers that a particular market or business entity is best 
suited to satisfy their needs and foster strong customer loyalty through trust (Ali 
et al., 2021). Essentially, it reflects the customer’s desire for quality products and 
services and underscores the responsibility of businesses to cultivate a sense of

comfort, trust, and loyalty. 
In the context of healthcare, service quality is a broad term that includes all 
the characteristics and elements of a good or service that affect its ability to meet 
explicit or implicit demands. The quality of health care services encompasses 
meeting the needs of both patients and professionals (professional quality); op-
timizing resource utilization; minimizing errors, delays, and inefficiencies; and 
complying with overarching regulations (management quality) (Korwar, 1997; 
Suguanthi & Shanthi, 2017). 
2.3. Customer Loyalty 
Pearson (1996) defined customer loyalty as the mindset of customers who hold 
favourable attitudes towards a company, commit to repurchasing the company’s 
products or services, and recommend them to others. Similarly, Oliver (1999) 
defines loyalty as “a deeply held commitment to consistently repurchase a pre-
ferred product or service in the future, even in the face of situational influences 
and marketing efforts that may encourage switching behaviours.” Customer 
loyalty is recognized as a long-term asset and a crucial business outcome 
(Abu-Alhaija et al., 2018). Many companies consider having loyal customers as 
an essential strategy, given its significant role in establishing sustainable com-
petitive advantages. Achieving customer loyalty involves identifying, managing, 
and meeting customer needs (Komunda et al., 2015). Companies can cultivate 
loyalty among their customers by providing superior value, exceptional services, 
and high-quality products (Rahman et al., 2012; Uslu & Eren, 2020). Remarka-
bly, achieving customer loyalty in business organizations is heavily influenced by 
service quality and customer satisfaction (Ehigie, 2006). 
In the contemporary rapidly evolving market, the task of establishing and 
sustaining customer loyalty has grown more complex, largely owing to techno-
logical progress and the prevalent use of the Internet. To foster loyalty, busi-
nesses must place strong emphasis on the value of their products and services, 
showing a sincere commitment to fulfilling customer needs and cultivating ro-
bust customer relationships (Uslu & Eren, 2020). Building a strong relationship 
with customers is a critical element in fostering customer loyalty, which often 
requires companies to function within a broader framework that goes beyond 
their primary expertise because no single company can excel in every facet 
(McDonald & Keen, 2000). 
2.4. Service Quality and Customer Loyalty. 
Rajeswari et al. (2017) illustrate that when service providers enhance the quality 
of their services, customer loyalty tends to increase. Similarly, in a study con-
ducted by Boohene and Agyapong (2011), which investigated the determinants 
of customer loyalty in Ghana, the importance of prioritizing service quality 
within telecommunication management was highlighted. They emphasized that 
given the intangible nature of services, service quality is commonly evaluated

through the relationships between service providers and customers. 
The study conducted by Parasuraman et al. (1988) underscores the positive 
and significant relationship between service quality and customer loyalty. It is 
important to note that service quality, with factors such as cost, assurance, re-
sponsiveness, and reliability following in that order, plays a central role in this 
context, which aligns with the findings of Parasuraman et al. (1994). Addition-
ally, Nsiah and Mensah (2014) observed that satisfaction with product offerings 
(quality) is a primary driver of overall customer loyalty. In summary, a positive 
association exists between service quality and customer loyalty, and consistent 
research findings demonstrate the substantial impact of service quality on or-
ganizational outcomes, particularly fostering customer loyalty (Ehigie, 2006). 
Moreover, service quality influences customer loyalty through repurchase inten-
tions (Levesque & McDougall, 1996). The success of a service provider is closely 
tied to the quality of the customer relationship, which in turn affects customer 
loyalty (Komunda et al., 2015). It is widely acknowledged that high service qual-
ity significantly leads to customer satisfaction and, consequently, customer loy-
alty (Duffy, 2003; Osarenkhoe et al., 2017). 
Research conducted by Uslu and Eren (2020) establishes a positive relation-
ship between customer loyalty and customer satisfaction. When customers per-
ceive that their overall experience, encompassing service quality, ambience, and 
value for money, exceeds their expectations, they experience satisfaction, which 
in turn fosters customer loyalty and intentions to revisit. Factors contributing to 
customer loyalty include the quality of food, interpersonal relationships, social 
bonds, a pleasing environment, variety-seeking, dining experience, perceived 
value, switching costs, and price-value ratios. Similarly, Zhong and Moon (2020) 
illustrated that having dependable and trustworthy service personnel can create 
a welcoming and pleasurable dining environment, which, in turn, encourages 
patron loyalty in quick-service restaurants. Providing services on time, being 
dependable, accurately charging customers, and other aspects all help foster a 
loyal customer base. Oliver (1980) highlights that each service interaction pre-
sents an opportunity to deliver exceptional service quality and sets the company 
apart from its competitors in the quest for customer loyalty. The product, its at-
tributes, performance, reliability, sales processes, and customer support all rep-
resent the vital components necessary to meet or surpass customer satisfaction. 
Satisfied customers typically return for repeat businesses and serve as advocates 
by sharing their positive experiences with potential customers (Komunda et al., 
2015). 
Customers frequently look for value in the entirety of the service, necessitating 
internal cooperation among various departments responsible for different facets 
of the offering, which may include the core product (goods or services), product 
delivery, product documentation, etc. Therefore, companies must strive to gain a 
deeper understanding of their customers than they typically do. Building trust 
with customers is essential for facilitating feedback collection from customers 
(Parasuraman et al., 1994). Several key factors come into play in customer loy-

N. Harriet et al.

alty, with quality, reliability, empathy, responsiveness, and assurance being the 
primary influencers. To foster customer loyalty, both Oliver (2014) and Osarenk-
hoe et al. (2017) emphasize that every service encounter presents a chance to de-
liver exceptional service quality, setting the company apart from its competitors. 
The relationship between service quality and customer loyalty has not been 
carefully studied or solidly proven, even though customer loyalty is crucial to a 
business’s ability to survive (Ramzi & Mohamed, 2010). 
2.5. Service Quality and Customer Retention 
Numerous scholars (Ennew & Binks, 2005; Oliver, 1999; Ranaweera & Prabhu, 
2003; Venetis & Ghauri, 2004) have investigated the relationship between service 
quality and client retention. The results of their investigations regularly showed 
a direct correlation between client retention and service excellence. In particular, 
their results emphasize that reliability, responsiveness, empathy, and security 
significantly impact customer retention (Murugiah & Akgam, 2015). Further-
more, these studies reveal that empathy is particularly significant in customer 
retention, as customers tend to gravitate towards private healthcare services that 
genuinely prioritize their best interests. Customer retention is influenced by 
various factors, with service quality being the key driver in the purchase process. 
This process is expected to yield customer satisfaction and commitment, leading 
to repeat purchases (Sari et al., 2018). Similarly, in multiple studies (Ranaweera 
& Prabhu, 2003; Saeed et al., 2005), service quality consistently emerged as a 
pivotal factor in retaining customers. These results indicate that service quality 
has a positive and significant relationship with customer retention. 
Reichheld and Kenny (1990) were among the first to draw attention to the 
observable advantages of a business’s dedication to keeping consumers, asserting 
that a higher retention rate translates into a higher net present value for custom-
ers. Within the service marketing domain, retaining customers is considered a 
way to improve the calibration of customer care. In today’s competitive market, 
long-term survival depends on maintaining profitable long-term client relation-
ships and consistently providing quality customer services. According to Wilson 
(1995), customer retention refers to a consistent effort on the client side and the 
business to maintain the relationship. Better service quality encourages good 
behavioural intentions, which in turn helps customer retention (Nsiah & Men-
sah, 2014). 
Evidently, the effectiveness of customer service levels enhances customer re-
tention, reduces customer switching between service providers, and provides a 
competitive advantage over other competitors. In the past, customer retention 
strategies were often overshadowed by the primary focus on attracting new cus-
tomers, with marketing professionals downplaying their significance. However, 
companies that continually acquire new customers without retaining them are 
unlikely to achieve positive outcomes, emphasizing the vital role of customer re-
tention in the current business landscape. The relationship between customers 
and banks appears to be influenced by two distinct factors: social bonds, repre-

senting relational components that foster direct relationships, and structural 
bonds, which provide insights into the structural components of the parties in-
volved. As noted by Patterson et al. (1997), the service market is becoming pro-
gressively competitive, characterized by heightened price competition and the 
readiness of customers to change their loyalties. 
Service quality is linked to customer loyalty through repurchase intentions 
(Levesque & McDougall, 1996; Parasuraman et al., 1988). Enhancing customer 
retention not only benefits the retention of existing customers but also aids in 
acquiring new ones. Loyal customers are more likely to engage in word-of- 
mouth advertising because of their positive attitude towards their current pro-
vider. Reichheld and Kenny (1990) discovered that between 20% and 40% of 
new customers select a bank based on the referrals. van Riel et al. (2001) catego-
rized services into five distinct elements: user interface, auxiliary services, sup-
porting services, core services, and complementary services. This finding high-
lights the fact that service quality is mostly determined by perceptions. This un-
derscores the need for businesses to proactively assess how they deliver high- 
quality services that not only fulfil but also surpass customer expectations 
through direct input. The dominant view in the field of service quality suggests a 
positive relationship between customer loyalty and repeat purchases (Storbacka 
et al., 1994). Furthermore, research by Gounaris (2005) showed a strong correla-
tion between customer trust and service quality in terms of attracting and re-
taining new customers. Additionally, because clients know that they can rely on 
a reputable company, trust reduces uncertainty in a situation where they feel 
exposed (Aydin & Özer, 2006). Under the influence of trust, one is willing to 
repurchase from a company (Jarvenpaa et al., 2000). 
2.6. Customer Loyalty and Customer Retention 
Seth et al. (2005) highlighted the interchangeable use of the terms “customer 
loyalty” and “customer retention,” while (Gerpott et al., 2001) argued that these 
concepts are distinct. In today’s service business landscape, success hinges on 
retention and long-term focus on existing customers, particularly since a select 
few brands manage to cultivate loyalty at high levels (Jarvis & Goodman, 2005). 
Ulaga and Eggert (2006) propose that loyalty is contingent upon certain in-
centives offered by companies to their customers. Consequently, extensive re-
search has explored the impact of customer loyalty on firms, given its positive 
influence on repeat purchases (Oliver, 1999; Ulaga & Eggert, 2006). Loyalty can 
manifest through behavioural patterns, such as frequent purchases of specific 
products or brands, as well as attitudinal aspects, including emerging consumer 
attitudes and preferences. Hence, loyalty programs have been thoroughly exam-
ined by both researchers and industry professionals because of their potential to 
generate positive impacts on repeat purchases from the same service provider 
(Craft, 2007). These loyalty programs empower firms to enhance customer re-
tention and encourage customer recommendations (Ha, 2007).

Dick and Basu (1994) research revealed that highly loyal customers tend to 
reduce their motivation to seek new brands, leading to a diminished inclination 
to choose other brands and reduced effort in the decision-making process. Re-
search has consistently shown that positive consumption experiences and accu-
mulation of trust strongly influence repeat purchase intentions among loyal 
customers. Additionally, the diffusion of trust in specific firms tends to reduce 
perceived risk when purchasing other services from the same company, thus in-
creasing repeat purchases of the same brand. 
Another crucial aspect of loyal customers is their consistent and frequent 
purchase of preferred services or products. Thomas and Tobe (2012) highlighted 
the notion that “loyalty is more profitable.” Gaining a new customer is signifi-
cantly more expensive than maintaining an existing customer. Loyal consumers 
not only persuade others to buy from you but also carefully analyze their options 
before thinking about switching to other businesses. Customer loyalty is devel-
oped through thoughtful sourcing and design choices, not through happen-
stance. Adopting customer-centric strategies that consider the requirements and 
preferences of the service recipient is necessary for cultivating client loyalty. 
Customer loyalty develops over time in multiple transactions. Osarenkhoe et al. 
(2017) highlighted that serving a loyal customer costs five to six times less than 
acquiring a new customer, highlighting the importance of customer loyalty. 
Walsh et al. (2012) emphasize the prudence of prioritizing existing customers 
before pursuing new ones. Furthermore, customer retention represents the fu-
ture inclination of customers to remain faithful and loyal to the use of goods or 
services (Ranaweera & Prabhu, 2003). 
According to Agyei and Kilika (2013) and Komunda et al. (2015), loyal cus-
tomers exhibit greater tolerance for negative customer experiences and greater 
willingness to purchase other products. Customer retention is a strategy used to 
transform customer behaviour, shifting it from defection to loyalty or fostering a 
strong, long-term relationship with the company (Hasan et al., 2013). This 
transformation is often based on trust built in the products and services offered 
by a particular organization. However, Aspinall et al. (2001) argue that customer 
acquisition is not as crucial as client retention. The study conducted by Payne 
and Frow (2018) revealed that in UK enterprises, client retention accounts for 
only 23% of the marketing budget. To have a competitive edge in the market—a 
crucial component of any business’s survival—many companies have also im-
plemented client retention tactics (Komunda et al., 2015). Hanks (2007) also 
pointed out that a 5% improvement in client retention might provide a massive 
75% boost in profitability. However, not all businesses place the same emphasis 
on establishing and sustaining strong relationships with every client because not 
all relationships and customers are profitable or consistent (Chen & Popovich, 
2003). Reichheld and Kenny (1990) have also observed that many firms concen-
trate on current-period revenues and costs, often overlooking the potential cash

2.7. Conceptual Framework 
The conceptual model that guided this study was largely influenced by the stud-
ies of Parasuraman et al. (1988) and Ranaweera and Prabhu (2003). This study 
focuses on the potential of service quality and customer loyalty as predictors of 
customer retention among healthcare providers in Mbarara City, as shown in 
Figure 1. 
When private healthcare providers implement strategies that ensure quality 
services, such as tangibles, responsiveness, empathy, and assurance, customers’ 
behaviour, emotions, and love for the business change and grow, allowing them 
to make repeat purchases and recommend the business to others. Additionally, 
improved service quality through tangibles, reliability, and assurance also im-
proves the effectiveness and positive attitudes towards the company’s products 
and services. Furthermore, customers are more likely to make repeat purchases 
and recommend the business’s services and goods to others when they grow to 
have a favourable attitude and enthusiasm for what the company has to offer. 
Finally, improved service quality and customer loyalty lead to repeated pur-
chases and referrals of other customers to the company’s services and products. 
It can be realized from the above extant literature that service quality, cus-
tomer loyalty and customer retention are correlated. The literature on service 
quality identifies traits such as tangibles, empathy, responsiveness, assurance, 
and reliability as the major factors that influence customer retention because 
they enable customers to hang on to the organization. The literature on cus-
tomer loyalty identifies honesty, trust, and integrity as the determinants of cus-
tomer retention. Customer retention can be enhanced by optimizing these indi-
cators. Nevertheless, uncertainty remains regarding the specific variables that 
can act as proxies for customer retention. Therefore, this study is necessary to 
bridge this gap in the literature. Moreover, prior research has primarily exam-
ined the independent and dependent variables separately, whereas there is a lack 
of literature on all three variables combined. This study aims to rectify this gap

by exploring the relationship between service quality, customer loyalty, and cus-
tomer retention among private healthcare providers in Mbarara City. 
3. Methods 
3.1. Research Design 
According to Amin (2005), a research design is an all-inclusive plan or approach 
used to conduct research. This study used a cross-sectional design, which in-
volved gathering data at a particular moment in time. This design was mostly 
selected using a questionnaire survey because it is economical, efficient, and 
simple to apply. The cross-sectional design makes it possible to gather important 
data in a comparatively short amount of time (Sedgwick, 2014). 
3.2. The Study Population 
The study population for this research study included the thirty-eight (38) active 
private healthcare providers in Mbarara City (Ministry of Health, 2018). Private 
healthcare centres were selected because they are accessed by all people, but 
many have failed to retain customers. The unit of analysis was the private health 
centres in Mbarara and patients over the years as a unit of inquiry since they are 
adults and have good reasons for visiting a particular health centre. 
3.3. Sample Size and Selection Procedure 
The sample size for this study, which included 36 private health centres, was de-
termined using the Krejcie and Morgan (1970) table for sample size determina-
tion. The sample was selected using simple random sampling. Specifically, a lot-
tery method was employed whereby a list of health centres was first obtained, 
followed by the allocation of a unique number to each health centre, writing the 
numbers and names on individual pieces of paper, and placing them in a box. 
The pieces of paper were then picked without replacement until a total of 36 
health centres were established. As health centres are the unit of analysis, they 
cannot answer questionnaires by themselves. Four (4) patients from each of the 
36 health centres were requested to complete the questionnaires. 
3.4. Source of Data and Data Collection Instrument 
The main source of data was primary data collected through self-administered 
questionnaires distributed to the patients. These questionnaires encompassed 
various aspects, including information related to respondents’ demographics 
and the specific characteristics of the healthcare centres. The questionnaire also 
included questions on customer loyalty, customer retention, and service quality. 
Responses to continuous variables were recorded on a 5-point Likert scale. The 
questionnaire design was aligned with the guidelines provided by scholars, such 
as Sekaran and Bougie (2016). To ensure the tool’s reliability and validity, a pre-
liminary version was pretested before the final survey was conducted. The 
items used to measure the study variables were adapted from previous schol-

N. Harriet et al.

arly work. 
3.5. Validity Tests 
Validity refers to whether an instrument measures what it was designed to 
measure, and is one way of trying to ensure that the measurement error is kept 
to a minimum (Field, 2013). A content validity test was used in this study to as-
sess the degree to which individual items in the questionnaire represented the 
constructs being measured (Field, 2013). Experts, experienced researchers, and 
academics were asked to rate the relevance of the items in the instrument. The 
content validity index (CVI) for each variable 0.7 is the recommended cut-off 
point (Field, 2013). 
3.6. Reliability Tests 
According to Field (2013), a measure’s reliability is its capacity to yield consis-
tent outcomes when applied to the same circumstances. In this study, the inter-
nal consistency of the scales was assessed using Cronbach’s alpha (α), a widely 
used and trustworthy reliability metric. According to the criteria established by 
Nunnally (1978) and De Vellis (2003), an alpha coefficient cutoff point of 0.7 
provides adequate evidence that the item scales are both consistent and reliable, 
thus allowing us to infer that the instrument demonstrated reliability. The in-
strument was pilot tested among health centres in Kabale Municipality, and the 
reliability results are shown in Table 1. 
3.7. Data Processing and Analysis 
Data from the field were cleaned to ensure completeness. This is followed by 
testing the regression assumptions. Next, the relationships between variables 
were tested using correlation and regression analyses. This is detailed as follows: 
3.7.1. Data Cleaning 
The collected data were edited first to identify and eliminate errors, the informa-
tion was categorized according to its different nature and then well coded, and 
responses were entered into the Statistical Package for Social Scientists (SPSS) 
Version 21. An outlier check was conducted using minimum and maximum 
frequency counts, means, and scatter plots. Outliers are values outside the range 
of the measurement scale (Field, 2013). Based on this analysis, a few identified 
outliers were due to data entry errors and were deleted. Parametric assumption

tests were also performed. This was necessary, given the conceptualization of the 
study. Conceptualization required the use of parametric analyses, such as corre-
lation and regression. However, these analyses depend on parametric assump-
tions. The researcher tested for normal data distribution, variance homogeneity, 
data linearity, and the absence of multicollinearity, which are critical for further 
statistical analyses. These tests were conducted according to the recommenda-
tions of Hair et al. (1987). Evaluation of these assumptions is essential because 
the validity of the findings drawn from statistical analyses relies on the sound-
ness of these assumptions. Parametric tests were performed to confirm that the 
sample met the criteria for the parametric data. Subsequently, correlation and 
regression analyses were conducted to explore the relationships among the study 
variables. 
3.7.2. Data Analysis 
Data analysis involved descriptive statistics, correlations, and regressions. Pear-
son’s correlation coefficient was used to evaluate the association between the 
study variables. Ordinary least squares regression was used to assess the predic-
tive power of the conceptualized model. The results are then presented in the 
following section. 
3.8. Ethical Considerations 
The participants were made aware, to protect their privacy, that the study did 
not require their names (Mugenda & Mugenda, 2003a, 2003b). The respondents 
were also informed that any information they submitted would only be used for 
academic purposes, and that any information about personal matters would be 
handled with the highest discretion to ensure anonymity (Amin, 2005). Before 
conducting the study, the researcher made all efforts to obtain approval from the 
Mbarara City Health Office (CHO) and health care providers. The researcher 
acknowledges and credits the work of other researchers. 
4. Results 
4.1. Demographic Characteristics of the Respondents 
The following details about the respondents’ demographic profiles were re-
quested: sex, age range, educational attainment, and marital status. 
The results in Table 2 indicate that most of the respondents were female 
(68.1%) and the males were 31.9%. This implies that women tend to visit health 
centres more often than men. In addition, women tended to take children to 
private health care services compared to men, which h is why they were more in 
the study. 
The results in Table 2 indicate that most of the respondents were between 31 - 
40 years (43.5%), followed by those between 21 - 30 years (23.9%). These find-
ings imply that most of the individuals who go for healthcare services are mature 
and responsible parents who are normally above 25 years of age, and these pro-
vided true information about the study variables.

The results in Table 2 indicate that most of the respondents were degree 
holders and above (44.2%), followed by diploma holders (28.3%), and the least 
group had primary-level certificates (5.1%). These findings imply that most of 
the individuals who access private health care are the elite class who do not want 
to waste a lot of time waiting for government services, and these gave a clear 
picture of the status of private health centres. 
The results in Table 2 indicate that most of the respondents were married 
(63.0%), followed by singles (31.9%), and the least divorced (5.1%). These results 
imply that most married people have health-related problems because they typi-
cally have young children who are prone to diseases. 
The results in Table 2 indicate that customers had spent 2-5 years (35.5%), 
followed by those who had spent less than 1 year (33.3%), and the least group 
had spent more than 10 years (6.5%). These findings imply that most of the cus-
tomers provided information that was relevant to the study subject since they 
had spent more than two years providing health care services in private health 
centres. Those customers who had spent one year also had information about

where they had left where they were getting their services before, and this pro-
vided valid information to make a recommendable conclusion about customer 
retention. 
4.2. Correlation Analysis 
A zero-order correlation analysis was conducted to establish the association be-
tween the independent variables (service quality and customer loyalty) and de-
pendent variable (customer retention). The results are presented in Table 3. 
The results in Table 3 show a significant positive relationship between service 
quality and customer retention among private healthcare providers in Mbarara 
City (r = .557**, p < .01). This means that any positive change in service quality 
results in a positive change in customer retention. Additionally, the results fur-
ther imply that any improvement in tangibility, reliability, responsiveness, as-
surance, and empathy would result in a positive change in customer retention 
among private healthcare providers in Mbarara City. 
The results in Table 3 show that there is a significant positive relationship 
between service quality and customer loyalty among private healthcare providers 
in Mbarara City (r = .660**, p < .01). This means that any positive change in ser-
vice quality results in a positive change in customer loyalty. In addition, the re-
sults imply that any improvement in tangibility, reliability, responsiveness, as-
surance, and empathy would result in a positive change in customer loyalty 
among private healthcare providers in Mbarara City.

tomer loyalty and customer retention among private healthcare providers in

Mbarara City (r = .760**, p < .01). This means that any positive change in cus-
tomer loyalty results in a positive change in customer retention. In addition, the 
results further imply that any improvement in behaviour, affective, and cognitive 
among customers would result in a positive change in customer retention 
among private healthcare providers in Mbarara City. 
4.3. Ordinary Least Square Regression 
Regression analysis was used to confirm the relationship between service quality, 
customer loyalty, and customer retention, as they are three variables. The results 
are presented in Table 4. 
The results in Table 4 indicate that service quality was found to be an insig-
nificant predictor of customer retention among private health centres in 
Mbarara City, as indicated by a probability value below the 95% level of confi-
dence (Beta = .098, p < .05). This implies that a positive change in service quality 
may not necessarily improve customer retention. The results further indicated 
that customer loyalty was a significant predictor of customer retention, as indi-
cated by a significance level of above 95% level of confidence (Beta = .695, p 
< .01). This implies that a unit increase in customer loyalty results in a .695 unit 
increase in customer retention. 
Finally, the results indicate that 57.7% (Adjusted R Square = .557) of the 
variations in customer retention were a result of changes in service quality and 
customer loyalty. This also implies that 44.3% of the changes in customer reten-
tion were due to other factors not considered in this study, such as customers’ 
level of income and customer awareness of private services in Mbarara city. 
5. Discussion 
The correlation findings indicated a significant relationship between service 
quality and customer retention; however, the regression results demonstrated 
that service quality does not serve as a significant predictor of customer retention 
among private healthcare providers. The findings indicate that improvements in

service quality in terms of tangibility, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and 
empathy may not necessarily improve customer retention among private 
healthcare providers in Mbarara City. 
This can be attributed to the nature and conduct of the people in the western 
region of Uganda. Anecdotal evidence shows that most Westerners are arrogant, 
not empathetic, have the “I don’t care” attitude, and customer care is next to 
impossible. As such, there is evidence that most health centres lack food for their 
patients; if it is there, it is of poor quality; there is the issue of opening late, staff 
not minding the emergencies, staff taking their time, the places are not that tidy, 
it is rare for patients to get apologies for the inconveniences caused, etc. In short, 
patients rarely obtain the value of the money they expect. 
These results contrast with the findings of Oliver (1999) and Ranaweera and 
Prabhu (2003) which indicated a direct relationship between service quality and 
customer retention. Their studies demonstrated that attributes such as reliabil-
ity, responsiveness, empathy, and security have a substantial impact on customer 
retention (Komunda et al., 2015). Furthermore, their findings point to a signifi-
cant connection between empathy and customer retention, suggesting that indi-
viduals Favor private healthcare services that genuinely prioritize their well- 
being. Customer retention appears to be influenced by multiple factors, with 
service quality being a crucial element shaping the dynamics of a purchase 
transaction. 
Correlation analysis revealed a strong relationship between customer loyalty 
and service excellence. Nonetheless, the findings of the regression analysis indi-
cated that, among private healthcare providers, client loyalty may not be signifi-
cantly predicted by service quality. These results suggest that improving client 
loyalty within the private healthcare sector in Mbarara City may not always fol-
low improving components of service quality, such as tangibility, reliability, re-
sponsiveness, assurance, and empathy. 
This implies that the improvement of tangible equipment in terms of having 
updated machines, a clean environment of the health facility, having enough 
rooms in the health centre, and having properly qualified nurses will result in an 
improvement in customer loyalty. In addition, when the services of the health 
facility are reliable in terms of staff doing the right thing at the right time, the 
health centre is well located in the most accessible place and keeps the patients’ 
records properly for easy accessibility, which will result in an improvement in 
customer loyalty. 
Furthermore, when activities related to responsiveness to the client’s needs are 
focused on, in terms of patients receiving prompt services from the health cen-
tre, staff giving clear explanations to the customers and employees at the health 
centre being able to help every patient, this will lead to improved customer loy-
alty. Finally, when activities related to assurance and empathy for customers are 
improved, customer loyalty will improve. 
These results are consistent with those of the study conducted by Suguanthi 

N. Harriet et al.

Open Journal of Social Sciences
 
and Shanthi (2017), which similarly highlighted the positive correlation between 
service quality and customer loyalty. Similarly, in an analysis by Boohene and 
Agyapong (2011) regarding customer loyalty in the context of telecommunica-
tion management in Ghana, they emphasized the significance of quality. They 
highlighted that service firms that often lack tangible products are typically 
evaluated based on interactions between the service provider and customers. 
This study found a strong positive correlation between service quality and 
customer loyalty. However, service quality is not a significant predictor of cus-
tomer loyalty among private healthcare providers because service quality dimen-
sions such as tangibles, which include healthcare infrastructure and reliability 
like location, do not change the patient’s perception and feeling about the health 
centre services since they are mostly convinced when they heal other than where 
they are treated. 
The correlation and regression findings confirm that customer loyalty has a 
positive and significant relationship with customer loyalty and customer reten-
tion. This implies that any improvement in activities related to the behaviour of 
health workers is improved in terms of decreasing the charges of health care, 
improving the services at the health unit, and ensuring that the services offered 
are the best choice will result in customer retention. In addition, improvement 
in activities related to affect in terms of clients having a positive emotional rela-
tion to the health centre they have chosen, and customers considering them-
selves as loyal patrons of the health centre will result in improvement in cus-
tomer retention. Finally, when customers are cognitive in terms of looking at the 
health centre as being different from others, saying positive things about the 
health centre, and being committed to the health centre, this will result in im-
provement in customer retention among private health care providers. 
These results are in line with Seth et al. (2005), who pointed out that histori-
cally, the terms customer loyalty and customer retention have often been used 
interchangeably, although Gerpott et al. (2001) argued that they represent dis-
tinct concepts. According to Jarvis and Goodman (2005), a small number of 
brands can foster high levels of client loyalty; therefore, the secret to success in 
the current environment of service organizations is to focus on long-term cus-
tomer retention. Diller (2000) posited that loyalty may be contingent on the in-
centives provided by companies to their customers. Consequently, substantial 
research has explored the impact of customer loyalty on firms, given its positive 
influence on repeat purchases (Oliver, 1999). 
5.1. Conclusion 
It can be concluded that service quality, measured in terms of tangibility, reli-
ability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy, may not necessarily improve 
customer retention among private healthcare providers in Mbarara City. There-
fore, activities related to service quality may work in other cities that aim to im-
prove customer retention, but not Mbarara, implying that emphasis may be

placed on managerial issues of activities related to customer satisfaction to im-
prove customer retention among the private health centres in Mbarara City. 
Service quality is very important in improving customer loyalty, and accord-
ing to the results, there is a confirmed positive significant relationship between 
the two variables, which means that when one variable improves, the other also 
improves. In addition, customer loyalty can be improved by increasing the 
equipment, reliability of the staff, and all the services needed and responsiveness 
of health workers. 
Customer loyalty was also found to have a significant positive relationship 
with customer retention among private healthcare centres in Mbarara City. This 
also suggests that when customers exhibit positive behaviors towards services, 
effectiveness, and cognitive thinking, it will lead to an enhancement in customer 
retention among private health centres. 
Given these results, private health centres should consider all variables as de-
pendable indicators of customer retention. The outcomes of the regression 
model demonstrated the statistical significance of the overall model. Neverthe-
less, it is crucial to emphasize that a stronger emphasis should be placed on cus-
tomer loyalty, as it explains a larger proportion of the variation in customer re-
tention than in service quality. 
5.2. Recommendations 
There is a need for private healthcare centre management to focus on service 
quality as it will improve customer loyalty. This means that activities related to 
the reliability of the health staff, positive responsiveness of the doctors and other 
employees in the health centres, ensuring that the patients are assured of quality 
service, and equipping the health facility with the right machines that can test 
and treat any form of the disease will help improve customer loyalty. 
There is also a need to increase customer loyalty in terms of making custom-
ers feel as if there is no other better place where they can obtain better services, 
ensuring that customers can inform other clients about the services provided by 
the same health facility, which will result in improvement in customer retention 
among private health centres. 
Finally, the predictor variables in this study accounted for 57.7% of the cus-
tomer retention. This covers both predictor variables of the study. However, the 
remaining percentage may be attributed to factors other than those in this study. 
This is because customer retention is affected by factors that differ from one 
private healthcare provider to another. Thus, it is important to consider a variety 
of factors rather than focusing only on the predictor variables in this study. 
5.3. Limitations and Areas of Further Research 
This study employed a cross-sectional research design and collected data from a 
single point in time. As cross-sectional studies provide insights limited to the 
current period, future research endeavours could contribute to the field’s

knowledge by employing a longitudinal research design. This would allow for an 
examination of changes and developments over an extended period. 
This study used a predominantly quantitative approach. Incorporating qualit-
ative elements into this research would enrich the study by providing a deeper 
understanding of the subject matter.
