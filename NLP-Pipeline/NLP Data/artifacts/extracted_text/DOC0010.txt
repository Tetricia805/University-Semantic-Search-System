ABSTRACT 
The study assessed the impact of teenage pregnancy on family stability in Bubaare 
Sub-County, Rubanda District. The objectives of the study were; to investigate the 
causes of teenage pregnancy among teenagers in Bubaare Sub-County, to assess the 
effects of teenage pregnancy on family stability in Bubaare Sub-County and to 
identify coping strategies families use to deal with the challenges posed by teenage 
pregnancy in Bubaare Sub-County. A qualitative research approach was used and 
data was collected using interviews and questionnaires. The study findings on causes 
of teenage pregnancy among teenagers in Bubaare Sub-County were; peer pressure 
contributes to teenage pregnancy, lack of sex education leads to teenage pregnancy, 
poverty drives many teens into early sexual activity. The study findings on effects 
of teenage pregnancy on family stability in Bubaare Sub-County were; teenage 
pregnancy increases economic burden on families, teenage pregnancy leads to 
school dropout. The study findings on coping strategies families use to deal with the 
challenges posed by teenage pregnancy in Bubaare Sub-County were; families seek 
counseling services to handle teenage pregnancies. The study recommended that 
policymakers should develop and implement comprehensive sexuality education 
policies that are age-appropriate and culturally sensitive to address the root causes 
of teenage pregnancy.  
In conclusion, the study revealed that teenage pregnancy significantly affects family 
stability in Bubaare Sub-County, Rubanda District through increased economic 
burdens, emotional stress, school dropout, family conflicts, and reputational 
damage. The findings highlighted key contributing factors such as peer pressure, 
poverty, lack of sex education, broken family structures, and media influence. In 
response, families employ coping strategies including seeking counseling, involving 

x 
 
religious leaders, relying on extended family support, prioritizing education for the 
teenage mother, and, in some cases, resorting to early marriages.

CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Introduction 
Teenager pregnancy is still a major problem in the world, affecting people 
individually, in families, and in communities. It interferes with teenagers' typical 
transition into adulthood, which frequently results in financial difficulties, 
psychological suffering, and social disapproval. Families with teenager moms may 
experience significant instability, especially in rural areas with socioeconomic 
difficulties like Bubaare Sub-County, Rubanda District. With an emphasis on the 
causes, effects, and coping mechanisms of impacted families, this study sought to 
evaluate the effect of teenage pregnancy on family stability. 
1.2 Background of the Study 
1.2.1 Historical Background 
With historical roots ingrained in gendered, cultural, and economic dynamics, 
teenage pregnancy has long been acknowledged as a socioeconomic and public 
health concern. The phenomenon of teenager childbirth has affected marginalized 
people worldwide, especially in low- and middle-income nations. International 
agencies like the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the World Health 
Organization (WHO) have reported increasing rates of teenage pregnancies 
throughout the years, particularly in regions with poor access to economic, medical, 
and educational possibilities (UNFPA, 2021). 
Family stability has been greatly impacted by teenage pregnancy in South America, 
which is influenced by poverty, cultural norms, and restricted educational 
opportunities (Del Mastro, 2023). Although early motherhood was normalized in 

2 
 
extended family structures in pre-colonial communities, colonization brought rigid 
religious beliefs that punished unmarried pregnancy. Increasing urbanization and 
economic disparity during the 20th century contributed to a rise in teenager 
pregnancies, particularly in underprivileged areas. These pregnancies frequently 
caused unstable family structures by interfering with economic and educational 
prospects. Issues like poverty, gender inequity, and lax enforcement of policies 
continue to exist despite contemporary attempts to implement reproductive health 
initiatives (Smith & Sinkford, 2022). Teenage pregnancy therefore keeps families 
under stress by sustaining cycles of dependency and decreased social mobility.  
Historically, teenage pregnancy has been more common in areas where traditional 
customs and gender norms, like early marriage and little female autonomy, are 
deeply ingrained. These customs have endured down the years in Sub-Saharan 
Africa, helping to normalize early childbearing. UNICEF (2020) asserts that cultural 
norms frequently govern girls' early motherhood, considering it a rite of passage 
rather than a risk factor for socioeconomic instability. 
In order to decrease teenager pregnancies by increasing access to reproductive 
health care and education, national governments and development partners have 
launched a number of campaigns and policy initiatives over time. Nevertheless, the 
issue persists despite decades of work. According to the World Health Organization 
(2020), this is caused by structural deficiencies in the provision of health services, 
gender-sensitive education, and youth empowerment initiatives, particularly in rural 
regions. 

3 
 
In African countries, gender norms, poverty, and cultural traditions all have a 
significant role in the history of teenage pregnancy and its effects on family stability 
(Zgambo, 2022). In the past, extended families supported early marriage and 
childbearing, which were widespread and socially acceptable. However, these 
systems have deteriorated due to urbanization and modernization, which has put 
more strain on young moms (Haq, 2024). Teenage pregnancies increased in the post-
colonial era due in part to inadequate access to reproductive health services and 
education. This has frequently resulted in poor family relationships, financial 
difficulty, and school dropouts. Teenage pregnancy still causes family instability in 
spite of recent measures, particularly in low-income and rural areas. 
In East African countries, Cultural customs like early marriage and restricted female 
autonomy have long been linked to teenager pregnancy (Nhampoca & Maritz, 2024). 
In the past, it was socially acceptable and frequently encouraged by extended 
families for girls to marry young and have children early. However, formal education 
gained relevance as a result of colonial influence and subsequent industrialization, 
and early pregnancies began to be perceived as a disruption to the development of 
the individual and the family. Teenage pregnancies, which frequently occurred 
outside of marriage, increased in the late 20th century due to urban migration and 
poverty, leaving families struggling financially and leaving them with a single mother 
(Trask, 2022). The problem was made worse by inadequate health services and 
restricted access to reproductive education.  
In Uganda, although population control and education programs have changed over 
time, the rate of teenage pregnancies has not been completely reduced. Uganda 
continues to have one of the highest rates of teenage pregnancies worldwide, 

4 
 
according to the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS, 2022). Teenage pregnancy is a 
persistent issue with deep historical roots that has not yet been adequately 
addressed by policy or practice in rural areas like Western Uganda, where poverty 
and traditional values are prevalent. Teenage pregnancy is still a significant problem 
in Bubaare Sub-county, Rubanda District, where poverty and traditional beliefs are 
still prevalent.  
1.2.2 Theoretical Background 
The Ecological Systems Theory (Bronfenbrenner, 1979) and the Strain Theory 
(Merton, 1938) served as the study's guiding theories. 
Ecological Systems Theory 
According to Bronfenbrenner's Ecological Systems Theory, which was developed in 
1979, human development is impacted by many environmental system levels that 
interact with a person's biological potential to shape experiences and behavior 
(Bronfenbrenner, 1979). The microsystem, mesosystem, exosystem, macrosystem, 
and chronosystem are the five interconnected systems described in the theory. 
Through their connections with peers, family, the community, and societal 
institutions, these systems together impact a person's development (Neal & Neal, 
2019). 
Human development takes place inside nested environmental structures, and 
interactions between these systems continuously influence an individual's 
development, according to the Ecological Systems Theory's underlying presumptions.  
Another presumption is that people are impacted by their immediate and extended 
contexts rather than developing independently.  Additionally, according to the idea, 

5 
 
development is dynamic, which means that alterations throughout time like changes 
in family stability or socioeconomic standing can significantly impact a person's life 
outcomes (Tudge, 2019). 
This hypothesis explains how various environmental factors contribute to early 
pregnancies and their subsequent consequences on families, which is closely related 
to the study on the influence of teenage pregnancy on family stability in Bubaare 
Sub-County. How a teenager woman handles her pregnancy may be influenced by 
the presence or absence of familial support at the microsystem level. The teenager's 
capacity to pursue further education or seek out support networks is influenced by 
the mesosystem, which encompasses interactions between the home, school, and 
community. How well families are able to manage the financial strains of a young 
pregnancy depends on the exosystem, which includes factors like parental 
employment status and local economic stability (Bronfenbrenner, 2005). 
At the macrosystem level, family reactions and the general stability of the home are 
influenced by cultural and societal conventions surrounding early pregnancy, gender 
roles, and marriage. Teenage pregnancy trends and family adaptability are 
influenced by historical and life transitions, such as changes in socioeconomic 
conditions or policy regarding teenager reproductive health (Darling, 2020). The 
study may thoroughly evaluate the several elements influencing teenager pregnancy 
and how they interact to influence family stability in Bubaare Sub-County by using 
this framework. 
Strain Theory 

6 
 
Sociologist Robert K. Merton created Merton's Strain Theory in 1938. It offers a 
framework for comprehending how social factors influence abnormal behavior. 
According to the notion, people are driven to pursue alternative paths, which may 
involve risky or criminal activities, by social pressures and a lack of access to legal 
ways to succeed (Agnew, 2019). Teenage pregnancy and early sexual engagement 
are two such outcomes, especially for teenagers living in low-income environments. 
The foundation of Merton's Strain Theory is the idea that while society sets cultural 
objectives like stability and financial success, not everyone has equal access to legal 
ways to fulfill these ambitions. Because of the stress and anomie caused by this 
discrepancy, some people turn to other means of achieving success (Agnew, 2019). 
According to Merton, there are five ways that people can adjust to stress: 
conformity, which involves following social norms and goals; innovation, which 
involves pursuing success through illegal means; ritualism, which involves eschewing 
social norms but continuing to follow customs; retreatism, which involves rejecting 
both social norms and means; and rebellion, which involves trying to replace the 
current social structures with new ones (Passas & Agnew, 2020).  Strain theory is a 
useful paradigm for examining socioeconomic difficulties and deviance because of 
these adaptations, which also explain differences in deviant conduct and social 
reactions to inequality. 
In the context of teenage pregnancy, according to Merton's Strain Theory, societal 
expectations, restricted educational possibilities, and financial difficulties can cause 
stress in teenagers, especially in low-income neighborhoods (Bunting et al., 2020; 
Madkour et al., 2021). Some young females may regard early partnerships and 
pregnancy as alternate ways to obtain stability, social approval, or financial support 

7 
 
when traditional alternatives like school and job advancement appear unachievable 
(Harden, 2019). This is in line with the "innovation" form of adaptation, in which 
people use non-traditional methods to accomplish social objectives. Media impacts 
may also have an impact on how teenagers view early motherhood (Coyne et al., 
2020). 
Teenage pregnancy disrupts family stability in Bubaare Sub-County due to restricted 
prospects and economic hardship, as explained by Merton's Strain Theory. Teenagers 
are pushed toward early parenthood by poverty and a lack of support. These effects 
can be lessened with focused interventions in health, work, and education. 
1.2.3 Conceptual Background 
Pregnancy in a young lady between the ages of 10 and 19 is referred to as teenage 
pregnancy. This study views teenager pregnancy as a multifaceted occurrence 
having socioeconomic and psychological ramifications, in addition to being a 
reproductive health concern. The main ideas being reviewed are the interconnected 
consequences of teenage pregnancy, such as early sexual debut, unplanned 
pregnancy, school dropout, and family instability. 
In this context, the ability of a family to preserve functional relationships, emotional 
support networks, and economic sustainability is referred to as family stability. 
Particularly in low-resource environments like Rubanda District, teenage pregnancy 
upsets this stability by bringing with it unanticipated caregiving responsibilities, 
financial strain, and social stigma. After a teenager pregnancy, families frequently 
face emotional strain, intergenerational conflict, and disintegration (Banke-Thomas 
et al., 2020). 

8 
 
Furthermore, one of the most important conceptual pillars is access to reproductive 
health information and services. Teenagers in rural areas usually don't receive 
thorough sexuality education, which leads to poor sexual behavior decisions. These 
youths are more likely to have unprotected intercourse and become pregnant 
unintentionally if they are not given the right information and support (Habumugisha 
et al., 2021). 
Last but not least, the idea of social support networks is crucial to reducing the 
harmful effects of teenage pregnancy. Schools, medical facilities, peer groups, 
places of worship, and non-governmental organizations are some examples of these 
systems. Teenager moms' ability to pursue further education, obtain healthcare, or 
reintegrate into their communities is greatly impacted by the availability and 
accessibility of such services. 
1.2.4 Contextual Background 
Teenager pregnancy is still a significant developmental obstacle in Uganda. 
According to UBOS (2022), 25% of Ugandan girls between the ages of 15 and 19 are 
either pregnant or have previously given birth. Due to high rates of poverty, limited 
access to reproductive health services, and enduring cultural norms that encourage 
early marriage and childbirth, rural districts like those in Western Uganda are 
disproportionately impacted. 
Bubaare Sub-County in Rubanda District is a prime example of this nationwide 
pattern. The region is primarily rural, has poor educational attainment, high rates 
of poverty, and strongly ingrained gender norms. Teenage birth rates are rising, 
according to anecdotal evidence from nearby health centers. This trend is frequently 

9 
 
attributed to parental neglect, economic hardship, and a lack of sex education. 
Pregnant girls are stigmatized, expelled from school, and often become reliant on 
their elder partners or family (Akoth et al., 2021). 
Government agencies and non-governmental organizations have implemented youth-
friendly health services and conducted community awareness initiatives as part of 
their efforts to lower teenager pregnancies in Bubaare. These haven't, however, 
resulted in appreciable drops in teenager pregnancies, indicating that more serious 
structural problems may be at work. According to Muwonge et al. (2020), these 
include pervasive poverty, a dearth of economic prospects for young people, and lax 
implementation of child protection legislation. 
There is an urgent need to investigate the wider societal and familial ramifications 
of teenage pregnancy, as it continues to put strain on family structures in Rubanda 
District.  The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of teenage pregnancy 
on family stability in Bubaare Sub-County and to provide long-term, locally relevant 
solutions. 
1.3 Problem Statement 
Teenage pregnancy is a global public health and socio-economic concern, 
particularly in low- and middle-income countries where teenager girls face high 
levels of vulnerability. According to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA, 
2021), approximately 16 million girls aged 15–19 years give birth annually, with Sub-
Saharan Africa recording the highest rates due to poverty, cultural norms, early 
marriages, and inadequate access to reproductive health services. In East Africa, 
countries like Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda continue to struggle with high teenager 

10 
 
pregnancy rates, which significantly affect maternal health, reduce educational 
attainment, and undermine the stability of family structures. In Uganda, the Uganda 
Bureau of Statistics (UBOS, 2022) indicates that 25% of teenage girls have begun 
childbearing, a figure that climbs to 27% in the Western Region, highlighting the 
heightened vulnerability of rural communities. 
In Rubanda District, and more specifically in Bubaare Sub-County, teenage 
pregnancy has become a pressing issue that threatens family stability and community 
development. The problem predominantly affects girls aged 13–19 years from 
impoverished rural households with limited access to formal education and 
reproductive health services. Consequences include school dropout, early marriages, 
economic dependence, psychological distress, and increased strain on extended 
family systems. Despite various government and NGO-led interventions such as 
reproductive health education and youth-friendly services, teenage pregnancy rates 
in rural areas like Bubaare remain persistently high. This suggests gaps in the 
effectiveness, accessibility, or cultural sensitivity of existing strategies. The 
problem is further influenced by the roles and attitudes of parents, educators, 
religious leaders, and healthcare providers. If unaddressed, teenage pregnancy will 
continue to reinforce cycles of poverty, gender inequality, and disrupted family 
systems. This study, therefore, sought to explore the causes, impacts, and coping 
mechanisms surrounding teenage pregnancy in Bubaare Sub-County, aiming to fill 
knowledge gaps and support the development of informed, context-specific policy 
responses.

12 
 
1.4.2 Specific Objectives 
1. To investigate the causes of teenage pregnancy among teenagers in Bubaare Sub-
County. 
2. To assess the effects of teenage pregnancy on family stability in Bubaare Sub-
County. 
3. To identify coping strategies families use to deal with the challenges posed by 
teenage pregnancy in Bubaare Sub-County.

pregnancy? 
1.6 Scope of the Study 
1.6.1 Geographical Scope 
The study was conducted in Bubaare Sub-County, Rubanda District, a rural area with 
a high prevalence of teenage pregnancy. The district borders with Kisoro to the west, 
Rukungiri and Kanungu to the north, Kabale to the East, and the Republic of Rwanda 
to the south. Rubanda District lies on the main highway from Kabale to Kisoro, 
connecting to Rwanda and DRC.  Rubanda District was curved out of Kabale following 
the Act of Parliament of 3rd September 2015 and it became operational on 1 July 
2016. The area was chosen because of the high rate of cases of teenage pregnancies 
which have been reported to the in the sub county. In Bubaare Sub County, the 
majority of men and women have finished basic school, while a small percentage 

13 
 
have graduated from senior four, senior six, and tertiary institutions, respectively 
(Mukiza, 2020). The majority's low educational attainment prevents them from 
having formal employment opportunities. Because they are unable to provide for all 
of the family's fundamental necessities, they have turned to low-paying, informal 
work, which exposes many to unnecessary behavior. 
1.6.2 Content Scope 
This study's content scope was focused on investigating the problem of teenage 
pregnancy in Bubaare Sub-County, with an emphasis on identifying its underlying 
causes, how it affects family stability, and the coping strategies used by affected 
families. In particular, the study intends to examine the root causes of teenage 
pregnancies in the region, evaluate the impact of such pregnancies on family 
stability and functioning, and pinpoint the different approaches these families take 
to cope with and get past the difficulties that come with them. 
1.6.3 Time Scope 
The study examined teenage pregnancy trends and their impact on family stability 
within the last five years (2019–2024) to provide relevant and up-to-date data. 
1.7 Significance of the Study 
Policymakers 
The study might provide evidence-based insights into the root causes and 
consequences of teenage pregnancy in rural communities. This information will help 
in the formulation of targeted policies and programs aimed at prevention and 
support, ultimately promoting social stability and development. 
Healthcare Providers 

14 
 
The research might highlight the psychological, reproductive, and general health 
needs of teenage mothers. This might support the design and implementation of 
responsive and youth-friendly healthcare services, including counseling and 
reproductive health education. 
Community Leaders and Local Government  
The study might guide community-based interventions and sensitization campaigns. 
By understanding the social dynamics contributing to teenage pregnancy, community 
leaders can spearhead cultural and behavioral change through informed advocacy 
and local action. 
Families and Community Members 
The study might propose practical coping strategies and support mechanisms that 
families can adopt. This might help in managing the emotional, financial, and social 
effects of teenage pregnancy, promoting resilience and improved well-being among 
affected households. 
Researchers and Academics 
By contributing to the existing body of literature, the study may serve as a valuable 
resource for future researchers investigating related issues. It might open new 
avenues for academic inquiry into rural reproductive health, family dynamics, and 
youth development. 
The conceptual framework for this study is based on the socio-ecological model, 
which examines how individual, family, community, and societal factors interact to 
influence teenage pregnancy and its impact on family stability.

Narrative of the conceptual framework 
The causes of teenage pregnancy, such as lack of comprehensive sex education, peer 
pressure, early exposure to sexual activity, and limited access to contraceptives, 
directly influence teenager reproductive choices. However, these causes do not 
operate in isolation; they are shaped and mediated by socioeconomic, cultural, and 
policy factors. For instance, poverty and low educational attainment may increase 
vulnerability to early pregnancy, while cultural norms such as the acceptance of 
early marriages or stigmatization of contraceptive use further exacerbate the issue. 
Additionally, weak policy enforcement on reproductive health education and 
inadequate youth-friendly health services can limit preventive measures. These 
Independent Variables

intervening variables collectively shape the long-term impact of teenage pregnancy 
on family stability, affecting economic well-being due to increased financial strain, 
emotional health through stress and disrupted aspirations, and social well-being as 
young mothers may face stigma, limited opportunities, or strained family 
relationships. Therefore, addressing teenage pregnancy requires a holistic approach 
that considers these broader systemic influences to promote stability and resilience 
within affected families.

CHAPTER TWO: LITERATURE REVIEW 
2.1 Introduction 
Globally, teenage pregnancy is still a major social and public health concern, 
especially in low-income areas where socioeconomic and cultural factors play a role 
in its incidence.  Teenager pregnancy has effects on families, communities, and the 
advancement of the country in addition to the individual. This chapter reviews 
existing literature related to teenage pregnancy and its impact on family stability in 
Bubaare 
Sub-County, 
Rubanda 
District. 
The review 
includes 
theoretical 
perspectives, key conceptual discussions, empirical evidence on the causes and 
effects of teenage pregnancy on family stability, coping strategies employed by 
families, research gaps, and a conclusion. 
2.2 Theoretical Review 
The Ecological Systems Theory (Bronfenbrenner, 1979) and the Strain Theory 
(Merton, 1938) served as the study's guiding theories. 
2.2.1 Ecological Systems Theory 
According to Bronfenbrenner's Ecological Systems Theory, which was developed in 
1979, human development is impacted by many environmental system levels that 
interact with a person's biological potential to shape experiences and behavior 

19 
 
(Bronfenbrenner, 1979). The microsystem, mesosystem, exosystem, macrosystem, 
and chronosystem are the five interconnected systems described in the theory. 
Through their connections with peers, family, the community, and societal 
institutions, these systems together impact a person's development (Neal & Neal, 
2019). 
The Ecological Systems Theory is predicated on the notion that human development 
takes place inside nested environmental structures and that interactions among 
these systems continuously influence an individual's development. Individuals are 
assumed to be influenced by their immediate and extended environments rather 
than developing in a vacuum. The theory also makes the assumption that 
development is dynamic, which means that changes over time like adjustments in 
family stability or socioeconomic standing can have a significant impact on a person's 
life outcomes (Tudge, 2019). 
This hypothesis explains how various environmental factors contribute to early 
pregnancies and their subsequent consequences on families, which is closely related 
to the study on the influence of teenage pregnancy on family stability in Bubaare 
Sub-County. How a teenager woman handles her pregnancy may be influenced by 
the presence or absence of familial support at the microsystem level. The teenager's 
capacity to pursue further education or seek out support networks is influenced by 
the mesosystem, which encompasses interactions between the home, school, and 
community. How well families are able to manage the financial strains of a young 
pregnancy depends on the exosystem, which includes factors like parental 
employment status and local economic stability (Bronfenbrenner, 2005). 

20 
 
At the macrosystem level, family reactions and the general stability of the home are 
influenced by cultural and societal conventions surrounding early pregnancy, gender 
roles, and marriage. Teenage pregnancy trends and family adaptability are 
influenced by historical and life transitions, such as changes in socioeconomic 
conditions or policy regarding teenager reproductive health (Darling, 2020). The 
study may thoroughly evaluate the several elements influencing teenager pregnancy 
and how they interact to influence family stability in Bubaare Sub-County by using 
this framework. 
2.2.2 Strain Theory 
Overview Sociologist Robert K. Merton created Merton's Strain Theory in 1938. It 
offers a framework for comprehending how social factors influence abnormal 
behavior. According to the notion, people are driven to pursue alternative paths, 
which may involve risky or criminal activities, by social pressures and a lack of access 
to legal ways to succeed (Agnew, 2019). Teenage pregnancy and early sexual 
engagement are two such outcomes, especially for teenagers living in low-income 
environments. 
The foundation of Merton's Strain Theory is the idea that while society sets cultural 
objectives like stability and financial success, not everyone has equal access to legal 
ways to fulfill these ambitions.  Because of the stress and anomie caused by this 
discrepancy, some people turn to other means of achieving success (Agnew, 2019).  
According to Merton, there are five ways that people can adjust to stress: 
conformity, which involves following social norms and goals; innovation, which 
involves pursuing success through illegal means; ritualism, which involves eschewing 
social norms but continuing to follow customs; retreatism, which involves rejecting 

21 
 
both social norms and means; and rebellion, which involves trying to replace the 
current social structures with new ones (Passas & Agnew, 2020). Strain Theory is a 
useful framework for examining socioeconomic difficulties and deviance because of 
these adaptations, which also explain differences in deviant conduct and social 
reactions to inequality.  
According to Merton's Strain Theory, cultural expectations, restricted educational 
prospects, and financial difficulty may cause stress in teenagers, especially in low-
income communities, when it comes to teen pregnancy (Bunting et al., 2020; 
Madkour et al., 2021). Some young females may regard early partnerships and 
pregnancy as alternate ways to obtain stability, social approval, or financial support 
when traditional alternatives like school and job advancement appear unachievable 
(Harden, 2019). This is in line with the "innovation" form of adaptation, in which 
people use non-traditional methods to accomplish social objectives. Media impacts 
may also have an impact on how teenagers view early motherhood (Coyne et al., 
2020). Teenage pregnancy disrupts family stability in Bubaare Sub-County due to 
restricted prospects and economic hardship, as explained by Merton's Strain Theory.  
Teenagers are pushed toward early parenthood by poverty and a lack of support.  
These consequences can be lessened by focused interventions in the fields of health, 
work, and education. 
2.3 Empirical Review 
2.3.1 Causes of Teenage Pregnancy among Teenagers 
Poverty and financial difficulty are major contributors to teenager pregnancy. 
Teenager girls are frequently forced to participate in transactional sex, when they 
trade sexual favors for cash, food, or essentials due to economic insecurity (UNFPA, 

22 
 
2020). Many teenage females in rural areas like Bubare Sub-County are compelled 
to seek financial support through early marriages or partnerships with older men due 
to a lack of work options and household poverty. Although there is ample evidence 
linking poverty to preterm birth, little research has examined the direct impact of 
such economic vulnerabilities on family stability, especially in rural Ugandan 
communities. By investigating how teenager pregnancies brought on by poverty 
affect parental relationships, financial resources, and family responsibilities in 
Bubare Sub-County, this study aims to close that gap. 
The absence of access to thorough sexual and reproductive health education is 
another important contributing factor. Many teenagers still don't know enough about 
STIs, contraception, and the long-term effects of getting pregnant too young. 
Unwanted pregnancies and unprotected sex are made more likely by this ignorance 
(Guttmacher Institute, 2021). Though previous research has emphasized this 
educational disparity, few have looked at the ways in which this ignorance impacts 
the teenager girl as well as the larger family, including the stress, increasing 
dependency, and social stigma it causes.  
Teenage pregnancy is also greatly aided by cultural and religious conventions. As a 
means of maintaining family honor, ancestry, and traditional beliefs, early marriage 
and childbearing are frequently encouraged in a number of African societies, 
including Uganda (Mugisha & Mugisa, 2021). Early sexual activity and childbearing 
are encouraged by cultural views that define a woman's worth via motherhood, 
which can limit girls' access to education and employment prospects. However, little 
empirical study has been done to determine how these cultural factors interact with 

23 
 
family structures and whether they strengthen or impair family stability when early 
motherhood occurs.  
Teenage pregnancy is also caused by media exposure and peer pressure. Teenagers 
frequently copy the actions of their friends or celebrities, particularly when those 
actions are presented as contemporary or socially acceptable (Kalule & Ochen, 
2019). Teenagers may engage in dangerous sexual conduct to fit in due to peer 
pressure, and media outlets usually glorify sexual relationships without emphasizing 
the negative effects. However, the impact of peer and media-driven pregnancies on 
home stability whether through interrupted education, strained parent-child 
relationships, or financial strains is not adequately examined in the literature 
currently in publication.  
Another important factor is family background, especially dysfunctional family 
settings. Teenagers from households where there is parental abuse, neglect, or 
absence frequently don't receive the right kind of emotional support and direction 
(Ninsiima et al., 2020). These teenagers are more likely to engage in early sexual 
activity and become pregnant if they go to other sources for affection or financial 
support. Although the overall literature acknowledges these dynamics, local 
research on the ways in which teenager pregnancies from broken households lead to 
long-term instability within extended families particularly in rural communities like 
Bubare Sub-County are lacking.  
Additionally, one underappreciated factor contributing to teenager pregnancy is the 
lack of access to youth-friendly health services. Young people are discouraged from 
obtaining sexual and reproductive health treatments because many rural Ugandan 

24 
 
health facilities lack teenager-centered care, qualified staff, and confidentiality. 
Unwanted pregnancies are more common among girls who lack access to counseling 
services or contraceptives. Although this institutional gap has been extensively 
recognized (WHO, 2022), less is known about how it affects family stability through 
increased caring responsibilities, financial pressure, and intergenerational disputes. 
This study will look at these underappreciated effects on families in Bubare Sub-
County that are impacted by teenager pregnancy. 
2.3.2 Effects of Teenage Pregnancy on Family Stability 
Economic Strain on Families 
The financial strain that teenager pregnancy places on families is one of its main 
effects. Teenager moms generally lack the financial means to maintain themselves 
and their children, and they are frequently still reliant on their caretakers. As a 
result, families are left to pay for childcare, food, clothing, and medical care. This 
additional financial strain might further impoverish households in resource-
constrained areas like Bubare Sub-County, where poverty rates are already high. 
Teenage pregnancy raises household expenses, which reduces a family's capacity to 
fund the welfare and education of other children (UNICEF, 2021). However, there is 
a lack of localized research regarding how such economic strain directly impacts 
rural households in southwestern Uganda, as the majority of studies on this topic 
concentrate on national or urban settings.  
Emotional and Psychological Distress 
According to a recent study, families with teenage moms frequently face more 
emotional and psychological difficulties. Parents may experience anxiety, shame, or 

25 
 
disappointment, particularly in societies where teen pregnancy is frowned upon. 
Social disengagement, poor parent-child interactions, and internal family disputes 
might result from these emotions (Kagimu, Sekiwunga, & Atuhaire, 2021). The 
stigmatization that comes from the larger community makes these emotional 
difficulties even worse. Despite these facts, not much research has looked at how 
emotional turmoil like this affects parenting styles and family cohesion in rural 
Uganda. Additionally, by describing the emotional strain and psychological stress 
that teenager pregnancy causes in families in Bubare Sub-County, the 
aforementioned study highlights a gap. 
Disruption of Family Roles and Responsibilities 
Teenager pregnancies frequently result in changes to family dynamics, including 
adjustments to domestic duties and caregiving roles. Siblings may be neglected or 
forced to help with child-rearing responsibilities, while parents may end up co-
parenting their grandkids. Family members may experience conflict, stress, and 
resentment as a result of these unexpected role adjustments (Nabukalu, Lwanga, & 
Tumwine, 2019). Research and policy responses frequently fail to systematically 
capture such disturbances. However, there is a research gap because the study by 
Nabukalu, Lwanga, and Tumwine (2019) does not demonstrate how role 
reassignments in the family unit, brought on by teenager pregnancy, affect long-
term household harmony and stability in Bubare Sub-County. 
Educational Disruption and Intergenerational Poverty 
In Uganda, one of the main reasons why females drop out of school is teenage 
pregnancy.  Due to their inability to manage parenthood and study, many young 
women are compelled to drop out of school (MoES, 2020).  This results in fewer work 

26 
 
options and a lifetime of reliance on family or low-wage informal labor.  A cycle of 
poverty that impacts the teenager mother and her extended family is the long-term 
effect.  There is a dearth of precise data demonstrating how teenager mothers' 
disruption of their education affects family ambitions, production, and long-term 
stability in rural regions like Rubanda, despite national reports indicating this 
tendency.  This study will look at how early pregnancy-related school dropouts 
impact the socioeconomic trajectory of families in Bubare Sub-County. 
Limited Social Support Systems 
The lack or insufficiency of official and informal support networks for impacted 
families is another underappreciated effect of teenage pregnancy.  While some non-
governmental organizations offer interventions in metropolitan areas, these services 
are frequently absent in rural areas.  Without sufficient psychosocial or financial 
support, families are forced to deal with the complicated realities of teenage 
pregnancy (Gahongayire et al., 2022).  This exacerbates family dysfunction by 
fostering feelings of helplessness and loneliness.  There is no empirical data on the 
availability and efficacy of local support networks in reducing familial instability in 
Rubanda District, despite the fact that teenage reproductive health is receiving 
more national attention.  
2.3.3 Coping Strategies Families Use to Deal with Challenges of Teenage 
Pregnancy 
When faced with teenager pregnancy, families frequently seek support from 
community organizations, religious communities, and extended family members. 
These social networks offer practical, financial, and emotional support, which can 
lessen the strain on the family. Informal support networks are essential in many 

27 
 
communities for families to manage the difficulties of teenager parenthood 
(Muwonge et al., 2021). Some families actively encourage their teenage daughters 
to pursue higher education in spite of the obstacles.  To increase their chances of 
landing a steady job after giving birth, they might advise them to go back to school 
or seek vocational training.  In order to give the young mother greater chances for 
independence and a more stable future, these initiatives are frequently crucial 
(Nalwoga & Namuli, 2021). 
Many families look for alternate sources of income in order to deal with the financial 
difficulties associated with teenager pregnancy. This could entail launching small 
enterprises, accepting more work, or participating in locally based revenue-
generating endeavors. These initiatives assist the family in covering the higher 
expenses of healthcare and childcare that come with being a teenage mother 
(Atuhaire et al., 2021). 
In order to cope with the psychological and emotional effects of teenage pregnancy, 
some families look for professional therapy or psychosocial assistance. The teenage 
mother in particular benefits from counseling services as it helps her deal with 
stress, depression, and guilt. According to WHO (2021), psychosocial support also 
aids in the young mother's reintegration into the family, fosters positive 
relationships, and enhances the general well-being of the family. 
2.4 Research Gaps 
Even though teenager pregnancy in Uganda is becoming more and more of a problem, 
little is known about how it specifically affects family stability locally, especially in 
rural places like Bubaare Sub-County, Rubanda District. The majority of current 

28 
 
research concentrates on the health consequences, disruption of schooling, and 
financial strains faced by teenager mothers, frequently ignoring the ways in which 
early pregnancies impact the emotional, social, and economic dynamics of families 
and communities in this particular area. The ways that teenager pregnancy damages 
family ties, raises dependency ratios, and fuels domestic strife or dissolution in 
Bubaare Sub-County are not well documented empirically. This disparity emphasizes 
the necessity of doing localized research to comprehend the distinct sociocultural 
and economic effects of teenage pregnancy on the stability of families in Rubanda 
District. 
2.5 Conclusion 
According to the reviewed literature, social, cultural, and economic factors all have 
an impact on teenager pregnancy.  It causes mental misery, financial pressure, and 
disturbances in family roles, all of which have a significant impact on the stability 
of families.  Families use a variety of coping mechanisms, but it's unclear how 
efficient they are.  By concentrating on the rural setting of Bubaare Sub-County, 
Rubanda District, this study filled in existing research gaps by offering localized 
insights into the effects of teenage pregnancy on family stability and possible 
treatments.

CHAPTER THREE: METHODOLOGY 
3.0 Introduction  
This chapter outlines the research methodology used to assess the impact of teenage 
pregnancy on family stability in Bubaare Sub-County, Rubanda District. The study 
used a systematic approach to gather and analyze data, ensuring reliability and 
validity in addressing the research objectives. 
3.1 Study Area 
The study was carried out in the Western Region of Uganda's Bubaare Sub-County, 
which is part of the Rubanda District.  Teenage pregnancy is a major worry in 
Bubaare, a rural location where the majority of the population works in agriculture.  
The sub-county's numerous elementary and secondary schools, medical institutions, 
and community centers served as crucial sources of data for our investigation.  Given 
that the district has a higher rate of teenage pregnancies than the national norm, 
Bubaare's geographic and socioeconomic features make it a perfect place to 
investigate how teenager pregnancy affects family stability. 
3.2 Research Approach 
In order to investigate the lived experiences of families impacted by teenager 
pregnancy, the study used a qualitative research methodology. Understanding the 
challenges and frequently arbitrary social phenomena surrounding teenager 
pregnancy and its effects on family relations was best accomplished through a 
qualitative method. This made it possible to thoroughly examine how personal 
experiences, viewpoints, and social elements affect family stability. 
 
 

30 
 
3.3 Research Design 
Descriptive research designs are used to characterize a population, scenario, or 
phenomena in a methodical way without changing any factors (Ellis & Hart, 2023). 
The study's descriptive research design made it possible to thoroughly examine how 
teenager pregnancy affects the stability of families. In the context of Bubaare Sub-
County, this approach was used because it allowed the researcher to characterize 
and analyze the traits and impacts of teenage pregnancy on family structures. A 
thorough grasp of the difficulties and coping strategies that local families deal with 
as a result of teenage pregnancy was made possible via descriptive study. 
3.4 Research Procedure 
The research procedure begun with a review of existing literature to understand the 
factors influencing teenage pregnancy and its implications for family stability. 
Following this, the researcher identified and engaged relevant stakeholders such as 
local leaders, health workers, teachers, and parents of teenage mothers to seek 
permission and facilitate collaboration for data collection. Primary data was then 
collected through field visits to households, community leaders, and institutions. 
Informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to data collection. 
3.5 Target Population 
The target population of 65 people for the study included families with teenage 
mothers in Bubaare Sub-County, along with community leaders, teachers, and health 
workers. Specifically, the study focused on teenage mothers aged 13-19 years who 
had at least one child, as well as their family members, including parents, guardians, 
and siblings. Additionally, the study included community leaders, such as local 
council officials and religious leaders, teachers from secondary schools in the sub-

31 
 
county, and health workers from local health centers. This target population was 
selected because they were directly affected by teenage pregnancy and provided 
valuable insights into its social, economic, and psychological impact on family 
stability. 
3.6 Sample size determination 
Using Slovin's formula, the researcher calculated the proper sample size because the 
total population is 65 people. When working with a known population and a 
predetermined margin of error, Slovin's formula was used to determine a 
representative sample size. Using a 95% confidence level and a 5% margin of error 
to account for any non-responses, the sample size was determined by estimating the 
prevalence of poverty among the semi-illiterate population in comparable 
situations. Slovin’s formula is expressed as: 
𝑛=
𝑁
(1 + 𝑁𝑒2) 
𝑛=
65
(1 + 65 ∗0.0025) 
𝑛=
65
(1 + 65 ∗0.0025) 
𝑛= 65
1.16 
𝑛= 56 
Adding 10% for non-response 
New Sample Size = 56 respondents 
Using Slovin’s formula above, the sample size of 56 will be calculated plus 10% non-
response rate 
3.7 Sampling techniques  

32 
 
The study employed purposive sampling for all categories of participants. This non-
probability sampling technique was appropriate because it allowed the researcher 
to intentionally select individuals who were most relevant to the objectives of the 
study and provided rich, in-depth information on the issue of teenage pregnancy and 
its implications for family stability.

3.8 Methods of Data Collection 
This study primarily relied on qualitative data collection methods to gain a 
comprehensive understanding of the causes, effects, and coping strategies related 
to teenage pregnancy and its impact on family stability in Bubaare Sub-County, 
Rubanda District. The primary data was collected using two key approaches: in-
depth interviews and focus group discussions (FGDs). 
In-depth Interviews 
A purposively selected sample of key informants, including teachers, community 
leaders, health professionals, parents or guardians of young mothers, and teenage 
mothers themselves, participated in semi-structured in-depth interviews.  The semi-
structured style made it possible to probe individual experiences in a flexible way 
while staying focused on the goals of the study.  Teenage moms' personal stories, 
the events leading up to pregnancy, and the support or lack thereof from family 
members were all covered in the interviews.  Teenage pregnancy's emotional, 
financial, and social impacts on the family were questioned of parents and 
guardians. Teachers and health workers provided perspectives on the broader 
implications for education and health, while community leaders shared insights into 
community perceptions and responses. All interviews were conducted in a private 
and confidential setting to ensure participants feel safe and are able to speak freely. 
Interviews were recorded (with consent) and transcribed for thematic analysis. 

34 
 
Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) 
Focus group discussions were held with parents, community leaders, and local 
opinion leaders to gain a broader understanding of the community’s attitudes, 
cultural beliefs, and social dynamics that influence teenage pregnancy and family 
stability. Each FGD consisted of 6–10 participants, and sessions were facilitated using 
a discussion guide aligned with the study objectives. Discussions explored community 
norms surrounding early sexual activity and marriage, stigma associated with 
teenage pregnancy, and support systems available for affected families. FGDs were 
conducted in locations that were convenient and accessible to participants, and 
each session was audio recorded (with consent) and later transcribed and analyzed 
to identify recurring themes and group-level insights. 
 
 

35 
 
Secondary data collection methods  
Document review 
Relevant documents, including reports from health centers, schools, and local 
government, were reviewed to understand the institutional responses to teenage 
pregnancy and their role in mitigating its impact on family stability. 
3.9 Data Collection Instruments 
Primary data collection instruments 
This study's main data gathering techniques were intended to elicit rich and detailed 
insights from a variety of stakeholders. To perform one-on-one in-depth interviews 
with parents, teachers, community leaders, health professionals, and teenager 
moms, interview guides were created. Open-ended questions in these guidelines 
gave participants the opportunity to elaborate on their viewpoints, experiences, and 
opinions. The study sought to gather a broad variety of contextual and personal 
characteristics that might affect teenager pregnancy and its effects on family 
stability by employing open-ended questionnaires.  
Furthermore, guides for focus group discussions (FGDs) with parents and community 
leaders were created. The social, economic, and psychological effects of teenage 
pregnancy on family relations were the main topics of these talks, which gave 
participants a chance to reflect and talk with one another. Last but not least, during 
field visits, an observation checklist was utilized to record body language, nonverbal 
clues, and other contextual information that could improve comprehension of the 
circumstance and aid in data triangulation. 
 
 

36 
 
Secondary data collection instruments  
Secondary data was collected to provide a broader institutional context for the 
study. Document analysis was carried out using records and reports from health and 
educational institutions to examine institutional policies, available resources, and 
services for teenage mothers, as well as the challenges these institutions face in 
addressing teenage pregnancy. Key documents to be reviewed included the Uganda 
Demographic and Health Survey (UDHS) 2022, which highlights the national 
prevalence and health implications of teenage pregnancy, and the Ministry of 
Education and Sports Annual Performance Report (2023), which addresses its impact 
on school attendance and dropout rates. Additionally, policy documents such as the 
National Teenager Health Policy (2019) and the Revised Guidelines for the 
Prevention and Management of Teenage Pregnancy in School Settings (MoES, 2020) 
will be analyzed to understand institutional response mechanisms. By examining 
these sources alongside health service reports and school records, the study built a 
comprehensive understanding of the external factors influencing teenage pregnancy 
and its effects on family stability. The integration of primary data from fieldwork 
with secondary data from institutional sources enabled a more holistic and well-
rounded analysis of the issue. 
3.10 Data Analysis 
Since this is a qualitative study, thematic analysis was used to analyse data. 
Thematic analysis is a widely used method in qualitative research for identifying, 
analyzing, and interpreting patterns of meaning (Braun & Clarke, 2006). This 
approach allowed the researcher to examine interview transcripts and field notes to 
uncover recurring themes related to the impact of teenage pregnancy on family 

37 
 
stability. The data was transcribed from audio recordings taken during interviews, 
with participants' consent obtained in advance. The use of a digital recorder ensured 
the accuracy and completeness of data capture, complementing field notes taken 
during interactions. 
Themes were generated based on study variables and organized into coding 
categories. An analysis plan was developed incorporating direct quotations and 
frequently occurring concepts to ensure a rich interpretation of the findings. 
According to Noel et al. (2017), thematic analysis is valued for its clarity and ease 
of use, making it appropriate for this study. This method helped uncover 
institutional, social, and economic dynamics influencing how teenage pregnancy 
affects family cohesion, roles, and support systems in Bubare Sub-County. 
Quantitative data was analysed using Microsoft excel to generate frequencies and 
percentages and qualitative data was analyzed using content analysis method. 
3.11 Quality Control 
To ensure the quality and validity of the data, several measures was implemented. 
A pilot study was conducted with a small sample from a neighboring sub-county to 
test the data collection instruments and procedures, with feedback used to refine 
the interview and FGD guides. Triangulation was applied by using multiple data 
sources interviews, FGDs, and document analysis ensuring robust findings supported 
by various perspectives. Member checking was carried out by sharing preliminary 
findings with select participants to verify accuracy and relevance. Additionally, 
regular supervision of research assistants ensured consistency in conducting 
interviews and discussions throughout the data collection process. 

38 
 
3.11.1 Validity of the Instrument 
3.11.1.1 Internal validity of the research instrument 
Internal validity in research refers to the extent to which a study's design, methods, 
and procedures accurately measure what they are intended to measure (Kimberlin, 
& Winterstein, (2008). It is the degree to which a study is free from bias and 
confounding variables, allowing researchers to confidently attribute any observed 
effects to the variables being studied. The internal reliability of the instruments was 
examined by the researcher. Content validity data was used for the measurement 
of internal validity. By consulting with my research supervisor, the reliability of the 
inquiries being investigated was confirmed, and the researcher advised on what 
needed to be corrected. 
3.11.1.2 External validity of the research instrument 
According to Khirsan and Crawford (2014), External validity is the extent to which 
generalization of the findings of the research to other situations, people, measures 
and setting. In this study, the external validity was used to determine whether the 
findings of the study were generalized in other contexts. The sampling technique in 
table 3.1 above, the findings from the selected population was used to give a general 
overview of the entire population. 
3.12 Ethical Considerations 
The researcher sought clearance from the Faculty of Social Sciences at Uganda 
Christian University. An introductory letter was obtained from the Social Sciences 
Department at Uganda Christian University, which permited the researcher to 
proceed to the field for data collection. Permission was also sought from the Sub-
County Chief of Bubaare Sub-County, who authorized the researcher to collect data 

39 
 
from the targeted respondents. Prior to data collection, the respondents were given 
information about the study and were assured of the confidentiality of their 
information using a participant information sheet. Additionally, the researcher 
maintained confidentiality by using a clean dataset that was not contained any 
identifying information. This approach helped to ensure that respondents were 
protected and their responses remained unbiased. 
Informed consent was sought from each respondent by requesting them to sign 
consent forms indicating their willingness to participate in the study. The 
questionnaires were interviewer-administered, and after completion, the researcher 
collected them on the same day and prepared them for analysis at the end of each 
working day. Interviews were conducted with selected respondents to clarify 
significant issues that arised from the questionnaire responses. The researcher also 
conducted at least two Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) in every parish within 
Bubaare Sub County, with each FGD composed of 10 participants. 
3.13 Limitations of the study  
The study faced the limitation of scope and generalisability, which presented a 
significant methodological constraint, as it focused exclusively on Bubare Sub-
County in Rubanda District. This geographic restriction hindered the applicability of 
the findings to other parts of Uganda. Additionally, the unique cultural, economic, 
and social characteristics of Bubare may have differed from those in other 
communities, further limiting the extent to which the results could be generalized 
beyond the specific study area. To overcome this, the researcher clearly stated the 
limitations in the scope and methodology sections of the report and advised caution 

40 
 
in generalizing the findings, while recommending that similar studies be conducted 
in other districts for comparison and broader applicability. 
The study faced sampling constraints that affected the reliability of its findings. 
Since a small sample size was used, the results were not statistically representative 
of the larger population. Furthermore, the non-probability sampling technique used 
in this study was likely to introduce sampling bias, which limited the objectivity and 
generalizability of the study outcomes. To address this, the researcher ensured 
diversity within the selected sample to reflect different backgrounds and 
experiences, and acknowledged the sampling limitations while encouraging future 
studies to use larger, probability-based sampling techniques for more representative 
results. 
The study encountered data collection challenges that affected the accuracy of the 
findings. Respondents withheld truthful information due to the sensitive nature of 
teenage pregnancy and the associated stigma within the community, leading to 
social desirability bias. Additionally, reliance on self-reported data from teenage 
mothers or their families increased the risk of exaggerated or understated responses, 
which compromised the validity and reliability of the collected information. To 
mitigate this, the researcher assured participants of strict confidentiality and 
anonymity, conducted interviews in private and safe environments, and employed 
trained data collectors skilled in handling sensitive topics to promote honest 
disclosure. 
The study adopted a cross-sectional design, which limited its ability to establish 
causal relationships between teenage pregnancy and family stability over time.
