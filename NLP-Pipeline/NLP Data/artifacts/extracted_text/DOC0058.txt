Why Numerical techniques for finding derivatives
A large number of physical problems involve functions which are known only through experi-
mental measurements. In order to find derivatives of such functions one is forced to use methods
based on the available discrete data and the methods are purely numerical.
Sometimes, some functions with known analytical expressions, their derivatives may be so
complex and computationally involved in their evaluation that one must resort to numerical
methods, though less accurate, but have less involved expressions.
Throughout numerical weather prediction, you often need to calculate the gradient of a function
at a number of points. As we rarely know the equation which defines the function, we need to
calculate numerically an estimate of the gradient. This method requires the use of finite differ-
ence schemes. In this module we will be considering finite difference schemes to approximate
the gradient of a function in one variable. The problem can be stated more specifically in these
terms: how to estimate the gradient of a function in f(x), at a point a.
Numerical differentiation is the process of finding the numerical value of a derivative of a given
function at a given point. In general, numerical differentiation is more difficult than numer-
ical integration.
This is because while numerical integration requires only good continuity
properties of the function being integrated, numerical differentiation requires more complicated
properties such as Lipschitz classes.
3.1.2
Analytic definition of a derivative as compared to a numerical
definition
Analytically, we define the derivative of f(x) at x = a denoted f ′(x) as the limiting process,
f ′(x) = lim
h→0
f(x + h) −f(x)
h
.
However, a numerical approximation to f ′(x) involves a difference such as
Φ(h) = f(x + h) −f(x)
h
In geometrical terms, this can be represented as in Figure 3.1.

3.1. INTRODUCTION
Figure 3.1: Geometrical interpretation of a derivative
Note 3.1.1
f ′(x) is the slope of the tangent T and, Φ(h) is the slope of the line L.
As
h →0, Φ(h) →f ′(x) suggesting that h should be small for a good approximation. However, in
computing Φ(h) the two terms f(x) and f(x + h) are close in value. So there is likely to be a
loss of significant digits.

3.2. FORWARD DIFFERENCE APPROXIMATION
3.2
Forward Difference Approximation
The forward difference approximation for a derivative is given by,
f ′(x) = f(x + h) −f(x)
h
The formula can geometrically be represented as in Figure (3.2)
Figure 3.2: Geometrical representation of the forward difference approximation
What the above expression actually calculates is the gradient of the line which intersects
the points x, f(x) and x + h, f(x + h) as you can see from the figure above. In the figure, the
function is shown with a red line (a curve). The blue line (a lower straight line) represents the
approximation to the gradient and the black line (the upperline) is the actual gradient of the
function at x = a .
Example 3.2.1
Given a function f(x) = x2. Numerically approximate (estimate) f ′(2) with
step length below. Compare your results with the analytic/exact value of f ′(2).
1.) h = 0.1
Solution :
Since
f ′(x) ≃f(x + h) −f(x)
h
But f(x) = x2 and x = 2,
h = 0.1
therefore
f(x + h) = (2 + 0.1)2 = (2.1)2 = 4.41
and
f(x) = 22 = 4
therefore
f ′(2) ≃4.41 −4
0.1
= 0.41
0.1 = 4.1
However, the exact value of
f ′(2) = (2)(2) = 4
Since f ′(x) = 2x. This yields an error of 0.1.

3.2. FORWARD DIFFERENCE APPROXIMATION
2.) h = 0.01
Solution :
Since h = 0.01, therefore
f(x + h) = (2.01)2 = 4.0401
and
f(x) = 22 = 4
therefore
f ′(2) ≃4.0401 −4
0.01
= 0.0401
0.01
= 4.01
The error committed is 0.01 i.e smaller than in part (1).
■
3.) h = 0.001.
Solution :
For h = 0.001,
f(x + h) = (2.001)2 = 4.004001
and
f(x) = 22 = 4
therefore
f ′(2) ≃4.004001 −4
0.001
= 0.004001
0.001
= 4.001
The error committed in this case is 0.001.
■
3.2.1
Analytical derivation of the forward difference approximation
We derive the forward difference approximation analytically from Taylor series expansion of
f(x + h). By Taylor series we have,
f(x + h) = f(x) + hf ′(x) + h2
2 f ′′(x) + h3
6 f (3)(x) + . . .
(3.1)
f(x + h) = f(x) + hf ′(x) + h2
2 f ′′(c1) : x ≤c1 ≤x + h
(3.2)
If we rearrange equation (3.2), we get,
f ′(x) = f(x + h) −f(x)
h
−h
2f ′′(c1)
(3.3)
Equation (3.3) is the forward difference form which we can write in better notation as:
f ′(x) ≃f(x + h) −f(x)

3.3. BACKWARD DIFFERENCE APPROXIMATION
3.3
Backward Difference Approximation
The backward difference approximation for the derivative is given by,
f ′(x) = f(x) −f(x −h)
h
+ h
2f ′′(c2)
The formula can be geometrically represented as in Figure (3.3)
Figure 3.3: Geometrical representation of the backward difference approximation
Example 3.3.1 For the function f(x) = x2, approximate f ′(2) using the backward difference
approximation with step length
1.) h = 0.1
Solution :
Since the backward difference approximation is,
f ′(x) ≃f(x) −f(x −h)
h
But f(x) = x2, x = 2 and h = 0.1, therefore
f(x) = f(2) = 22 = 4
f(x −h) = f(2 −0.1) = f(1.9) = (1.9)2 = 3.61
therefore
f ′(2) ≃= 4 −3.6100
0.1
= 0.3900
0.1
= 3.900
Since the exact value of
f ′(2) = (2)(2) = 4,
therefore the absolute error committed by using the numerical formula is 0.1. This
is not very bad.
■
2.) h = 0.01
Page 54 of 196

numerical analysis i

3.3. BACKWARD DIFFERENCE APPROXIMATION
Solution :
Since h = 0.01 and
f(x) = f(2) = 22 = 4
f(x −h) = f(2 −0.01) = f(1.99) = (1.99)2 = 3.9601,
therefore
f ′(2) ≃4 −3.9601
0.01
= 0.0399
0.01
= 3.99
Error committed is 0.01. This is better than the previous.
■
3.) h = 0.001
Solution :
Since h = 0.001 and f(x) = 4
f(x −h) = f(2 −0.001) = f(1.999) = (1.999)2 = 3.996001,
therefore
f ′(2) ≃4 −3.996001
0.001
= 0.003999
0.001
= 3.999
Error committed is 0.00001. This error is smaller than any of the previous two.
In fact the zero error means the exact value of the derivative is generated.
■
Note 3.3.1
We note that the smaller h is the better is the numerical approximate to the
derivative.
3.3.1
Analytical derivation of the backward difference approxima-
tion
Using the Taylor series expansion
f(x −h) = f(x) −hf ′(x) + h2
2 f ′′(x) −h3
6 f (3)(x) + . . .
(3.4)
f(x −h) = f(x) −hf ′(x) + h2
2 f ′′(c2) : x −h ≤c1 ≤x + h
(3.5)
Rearranging equation (3.5) i.e
f(x −h) = f(x) −hf ′(x) + h2
2 f ′′(c2),
we get,
f ′(x) = f(x) −f(x −h)
h
+ h
2f ′′(c2) : x −h ≤c2 ≤x
Which is the backward difference approximation.
The approximation could also be written as,
f ′(x) = f(x) −f(x −h)
h
+ Etrunc
or
f ′(x) = f(x) −f(x −h)
h

3.4. THE CENTRAL DIFFERENCE APPROXIMATION
3.4
The Central Difference Approximation
We state the central difference approximation to the first derivative as;
f ′(x) = f(x + h) −f(x −h)
2h
+ h2
3! f 3(c)
The formula is geometrically represented as seen in the Figure (figure:central)
Figure 3.4: Geometrical interpretation of the central difference approximation
The slope of the line AB is the central difference approximation
f ′(x) ≃f(x + h) −f(x −h)
2h
.
From Figure 5.4, it is clear that the gradient of AB is closer to the gradient of the tangent at
x = a. That is, the two lines are almost parallel. This is expected to be a better approximation
than the forward and the backward. Indeed it is as we shall see in the following example.
Example 3.4.1
Approximate f ′(2) for f(x) = x2 using the central difference approximation with step size
1.) h = 0.1
Solution :
Since a = 2, h = 0.1, but
f ′(x) ≃f(x + h) −f(x −h)
2h
= f(2.1) −f(1.9)
2(0.1)
= (2.1)2 −(1.9)2
0.2
= 4.000000000
Since the exact value is,
f ′(2) = 2(2) = 4
therefore the error is zero to 9 places of decimals.
This could not be achieved with a forward or backward formula using same step
size. This is because the central formula is of higher order i.e O(h2)

3.4. THE CENTRAL DIFFERENCE APPROXIMATION
2.) h = 0.01
Solution :
with h = 0.01,
f ′(q) ≃f(2.01) −f(1.99)
2(0.01)
= (2.01)2 −(1.99)2
0.02
= 4.000000000.
This also generates a zero error.
■
3.) h = 0.001
Solution :
with h = 0.001,
f ′(2) ≃f(2.01) −f(1.999)
2(0.001)
= (2.001)2 −(1.999)2
0.002
= 4.00000000
Which also generates a zero error.
■
3.4.1
Analytical derivation of the central difference approximation
Using Taylor series expansion of f(x + h) and f(a −h) about x = a, we have;
f(x + h) = f(x) + hf ′(x) + h2
2 f ′′(x) + h3
6 f (3)(c1)
(3.6)
and
f(x −h) = f(x) −hf ′(x) + h2
2 f ′′(x) −h3
6 f (3)(c2)
(3.7)
equation (3.6) minus equation (3.7) we get;
f(x + h) = f(x −h) = 2f ′(x)h + h3
6 (f (3)(c1) −f (3)(c2))
(3.8)
Now,
f (3)(c1) + f (3)(2)
2
= f (3)(c3),
c1 ≤c3 ≤c2
This is derived from the intermediate value theorem.
So
f ′(x) = f(x + h) −f(x −h)
2h
+ h2
3! f (3)(c3)
i.e, the error is of order O(h2).

Comparision
It is clear that the central difference gives a much more accurate approximation of the derivative
compared to the forward and backward differences. Central differences are useful in solving
partial differential equations. If the data values are available both in the past and in the future,
the numerical derivative should be approximated by the central difference.

3.6. THE SECOND DERIVATIVE APPROXIMATION
3.6
The Second Derivative Approximation
The most commonly used approximation is of a central difference form which we obtain from
the following Taylor series approximations earlier considered in the previous lecture. Consider
again the expansions,
f(x + h) = f(x) + hf ′(x) + h2
2 f ′′(x) + h3
6 f (3)(x) + h4
24f (4)(c))
(3.11)
and
f(x −h) = f(x) −hf ′(x) + h2
2 f ′′(x) −h3
6 f (3)(x) + h4
24f (4)(c2)
(3.12)
addition of equations (3.11) and (3.12) gives,
f(x + h) + f(x −h) = 2f(x) + h2f ′′(x) + h4
12

f (4)(c1) + f 4(c2)

(3.13)
and using,
f (4)(c1) + f (4)(c2)
2
= f (4)(c3)
with c1 ≤c3 ≤c2. This is derived from the intermediate value theorem and making f ′′(x) the
subject in equation (3.13), we get,
f ′′(x) = f(x −h) −2f(x) + f(x + h)
h2
+ h2
12f (iv)(c3)
(3.14)
or
f ′′(x) = f(x −h) −2f(x) + f(x + h)
h2
+ O(h2)
(3.15)
Equation (3.15) is a second order approximation for the second order derivative. The formula
is handy for approximating second order derivatives.
Example 3.6.1
Approximate f ′′(1) for the function f(x) = x3 with
1.) h = 0.100
Solution :
Since,
f ′′(x) ≃f(x −h) −2f(x) + f(x + h)
h2
But x = 1,
h = 0.1, therefore
f ′′(1) ≃f(0.9) −2f(1) + f(1.1)
(0.1)2
= (0.9)3 −2(1)3 + (1.1)3
0.01
= 6.00000000000005
However, the exact value is f ′′(x) = 6x, therefore f ′′(1) = 6. Hence error com-
mitted is just 5.0 × 10−14. This is really small.
■
2.) h = 0.010
Page 60 of 196

3.6. THE SECOND DERIVATIVE APPROXIMATION
Solution :
With h = 0.01
f ′′(1) ≃f(0.99) −2f(1) + f(1.01)
(0.01)2
= (0.99)3 −2 + (1.01)3
0.0001
= 6.00000000000000
Since the exact value is 6, the error committed is zero to 14 decimal places.
■
3.) h = 0.001.
Solution :
This also generates a zero error, since,
f ′′(1) ≃f(0.999) −2f(1) + f(1.001)
(0.001)2
= (0.999)3 −2 + (1.001)3
0.000001
= 6.00000000000000

3.6.1
Error analysis in numerical differentiation
Addition of a rounding error term
When we use a formula such as
f ′(x) = f(x + h) −f(x)
h
+ Etrun(h2)
(3.16)
in general the difference f(x+h)−f(x)
h
will be evaluated with a rounding error. For example if f
is evaluated to four decimal places with h = 0.1, there is a possible rounding error of
2 × 0.00005
0.1
= 0.001
in the difference
f(x + h) −f(x)
h
.
This is because when a number is evaluated to n- decimal places, the maximum absolute error
committed is 1
210−n. Thus maximum error in
f(x + h) is 1
210−4 = 0.00005
and maximum absolute error in
f(x) is 1
210−4 = 0.00005.
But the error in the difference is a sum of the absolute errors in the individual numbers. So
the maximum error in
f(x + h) −f(x) is 2(1
210−4) or 2(0.00005)
ssebuliba & ddumba
numerical analysis i
Page 61 of 196

3.6. THE SECOND DERIVATIVE APPROXIMATION
Thus, the error in
f(x + h) −f(x)
h
is
2(0.00005)
0.1
assuming h = 0.1 is exact. Thus equation (3.16) becomes
f ′(x) = y1 −y0
h
+ Etruc + Eround
where, y1, y0 are the rounded values of f(x + h) and f(x) respectively.
Optimum step size
We now have that:
Total error = Etrunc + Eround.
Thus there is no point in choosing h so that |Etrunc| is small. If |Eround| is large since the benefit
is swamped.
Example 3.6.2
Suppose
f(x + h) = y1 + e1
and
f(x) = y0 + e0
and |e1|, |e0| < e (small number). Find the optimum choice for h when using the approximation
f ′(x) ≃f(x + h) −f(x)
h
Solution :
For the approximation,
f ′(x) ≃f(x + h) −f(x)
h
Maximum absolute error in f(x + h) is e and that in f(x) is also e. So
|Eround| < e + e
h
= 2e
h
Now
|Etrunc| = h
2|f ′′(c1)| ≤h

Finite Difference Operators
4.1
Introduction
The lecture defines and inter-relates the most common finite difference operators i.e. forward,
backward, shift, central and the averaging operator. Use of the operators to prove finite differ-
ence identities is also done.
4.1.1
Finite differences
We consider a function f(x) known for a certain set of equally spaced values of x such that
x = x0 + rh,
r = 0, 1, . . . , n
and h > 0. This generates a set of n + 1 pairs i.e. (xr, fr).
The xr are called pivotal points and fr = f(xr) are the pivotal values. The pairs can be
written as;
x0
f(x0)
x1
f(x1)
x2
f(x2)
·
·
·
·
·
·
xr
f(xr)
We can form differences between consecutive pivotal values i.e. fr+1 −fr where
xr+1 = xr+h for r = 0, 1, 2, . . .
The differences fr+1 −fr are called the first differences.
We similarly define higher order
differences.

Definition 4.1.1
We say that differences are converging if elements of higher order differences decrease rapidly in
magnitude. Such a behavior is common from tables of well-behaved functions like polynomials.
4.1.2
Finite difference operators
The most common finite difference operators are; the forward difference operator, the back-
ward difference operator, the central difference operator, the averaging operator and the shift
operator.

4.2. THE FORWARD DIFFERENCE OPERATOR ∆
4.2
The Forward Difference Operator ∆
The forward difference operator is denoted by ∆and defined by the difference equation;
∆fr = fr+1 −fr
(4.1)
Thus, the 1st difference column in a difference table consists of the elements,
∆f0,
∆f1,
∆f2 . . . . . .
The second differences are got by differentiating the first differences i.e
∆fr+1 −∆fr
(4.2)
But we can easily show that ∆is a linear operator i.e.
∆(αfr + βgr) = α∆fr + β∆gr
Thus equation (4.2), becomes,
∆fr+1 −∆fr = ∆(fr+1 −fr) = ∆(∆fr).
Example 4.2.1
Let y = f(x). Then
∆f(x) = f(x + h) −f(x)
∆y0 = y1 −y0
∆y1 = y2 −y1
∆yn = yn+1 −yn
Example 4.2.2
Compute ∆2y1
Solution :
∆2y1 = ∆

4.2. THE FORWARD DIFFERENCE OPERATOR ∆
Remark 4.2.2
If we write ∆2fr for ∆(∆fr), then the second differences are the quantities,
∆2f0, ∆2f1, ∆2f2, . . . . . .
Remark 4.2.3
We similarly get third differences as consisting of the elements.
∆3fr = ∆(∆2fr)
or
∆3fr = ∆2(∆fr) = ∆2fr+1 −∆2fr
Generally, we have that the nth order differences consist of the elements/quantities,
∆nfr = ∆n−1fr+1 −∆n−1fr
(4.4)
∆nfr = ∆(∆n−1fr)
(4.5)
Thus ∆kfr involves information at the pivoted points xr, xr+1, . . . , xr+k. Thus,
1.) ∆f0 involves information at x0 and x1
2.) ∆2f0 involves information at x0, x1 and x2
3.) ∆3f0 involves information at x0, x1, x2 and x3
and so on. In fact this is how the name forward comes about.

Note 4.2.1 We note that the fourth differences are constants and fifth differences are all zeros.
We state the following theorem to support this observation.
Theorem 4.2.1
Let Pn(x) be a polynomial of degree n(n ≥1 integer). Then
1. ∆rPn(x) is a polynomial of degree n −r(r ≥n integer)
2. ∆nPn(x) = constant
3. ∆n+1Pn(x) = 0.
Thus, parts (2.) and (3.) of the theorem confirm the validity of the results of the difference
table (4.4) in which fourth order differences are all constants equal to 24 and fifth differences
are all zero.

4.2. THE FORWARD DIFFERENCE OPERATOR ∆
In fact the theorem can help us check the behaviour of a function (not polynomial) on an
interval. If the nth order differences are fairly constant on an interval for a particular function,
then such a function more or less behaves like a polynomial of degree n in that interval.
Exercise 4.2.4 For a polynomial
P6(x) = x6 −6x2 + 1,
Construct a table of forward differences on the interval [4, −4] with step size 1.
Example 4.2.11
By constructing a forward difference table, find the 7th and 8th terms of a
sequence 8, 14, 22, 32, 44, 58, . . .
Solution :
Let
f(1) = 8, f(2) = 14, f(3) = 22, f(4) = 32, f(5) = 44, f(6) = 58
We have to find f(7) and f(8).
We prepare the following forward difference table

• To find f(7), extra 2 is written in ∆2 column. The entry in ∆f(x) is 14+2 = 16
is added. The entry in f(x) is 58 + 16 = 74 is added. Thus f(7) = 74.
• To find f(8), extra 2 is written in ∆2 column. The entry in ∆f(x) is 16+2 = 18
is added. The entry in f(x) is 74 + 18 = 92 is added. Thus f(8) = 92.
Thus the 7th and 8th terms of series are 74 and 92 respectively.

4.3. THE BACKWARD DIFFERENCE OPERATOR ∇
4.3.1
Relation between ∆and ∇
1.)
(1 + ∆) (1 −∇) ≡1
(4.7)
Proof:
(1 + ∆)(1 −∇)f(x) = (1 + ∆)[f(x) −f(x) + f(x −h)]
= (1 + ∆)f(x −h)
= f(x −h) + f(x) −f(x −h)
= f(x)
Therefore,
(1 + ∆)(1 −∇) ≡1
■
2.)
∆∇≡∇∆
(4.8)
Proof:
∆∇f(x) = ∆[f(x) −f(x −h)] = f(x + h) −2f(x) + f(x −h)
and
∇∆f(x) = ∇[f(x + h) −f(x)] = [f(x + h) −f(x)] −[f(x) −f(x −h)]
= f(x + h) −2f(x) + f(x −h)
Therefore,
∆∇≡∇∆
■
3.)
∆∇≡∆−∇
(4.9)
Proof:
Consider the function f(x).
∆f(x) = f(x + h) −f(x)
∇f(x) = f(x) −f(x −h)
But
∆−∇)(f(x)) = ∆f(x) −∇f(x)
= [f(x + h) −f(x)] −[f(x) −f(x −h)]
= ∆f(x) −∆f(x −h)
= ∆[f(x) −f(x −h)]
= ∆[∇f(x)]
Therefore
∆−∇= ∆∇

4.3.2
Properties of Forward and Backward Finite Difference Oper-
ators
1. Constant rule: If c is a constant, then
(a)
∆c = 0
(4.10)
Proof:
Let f(x) = c
Therefore
f(x + h) = c
(where h is the interval of difference)
∆c = ∆f(x) = f(x + h) −f(x) = c −c = 0
■
(b)
∇c = 0
(4.11)
2. Linearity: if a and b are constants,
(a)
∆(af + bg) = a ∆f + b ∆g
(4.12)
Proof:
∆[f(x) + g(x)] = [f(x + h) + g(x + h)] −[f(x) + g(x)]
= f(x + h) + g(x + h) −f(x) −g(x)
= f(x + h) −f(x) + g(x + h) −g(x)
= ∆f(x) + ∆g(x)
and
∆[cf(x)] = cf(x + h) −cf(x)
= c[f(x + h) −f(x)]
= c∆f(x)
Thus the proof
■
(b)
∇(af + bg) = a ∇f + b ∇g
(4.13)
3. Product rule:
(a)
∆(fg) = f ∆g + g ∆f + ∆f ∆g
(4.14)
Proof:
∆[f(x)g(x)] = f(x + h)g(x + h) −f(x)g(x)
= f(x + h)g(x + h) −f(x + h)g(x) + f(x + h)g(x) −f(x)g(x)
= f(x + h)[g(x + h) −g(x)] + g(x)[f(x + h) −f(x)]
= f(x + h)∆g(x) + g(x)∆f(x)

4.3. THE BACKWARD DIFFERENCE OPERATOR ∇
Also, it can be shown that

= f(x + h)g(x) −f(x)g(x) + f(x)g(x) −f(x)g(x + h)
g(x + h)g(x)
= g(x)[f(x + h) −f(x)] −f(x)[g(x + h) −g(x)]

4.4. THE SHIFT OPERATOR E

The Shift Operator E
Definition 4.4.1 The shift operator is denoted by E and defined by
Efr = fr+1
(4.20)
A shift operator is like a jump forward.
Remark 4.4.1 E is called the shifting operator . It is also called the displacement operator.

Note 4.4.1
By Definition 4.4.1 we can define higher order shift operators as,
E(Efr) = Efr+1 = fr+2.
We usually denote
E(Efr) = E2fr
and,
Ekfr = E(Ek−1fr) = fr+k.
Remark 4.4.2
For k negative, we get what is known as the backward shift. For example
E−1fr is a backward shift defined by,
E−1fr = fr−1
We also note that k can be fractional.
Example 4.4.2
Find E
1
2fr and E−5fr.
Solution :
By definitions of the forward and backward shifts i.e.
Efr = fr+1
and
E−1fr = fr−1
we have,
E

2fr = fr+ 1
2
and
E−5fr = fr−5.

E4y0 = y4 = 29

4.4.1
Relation between ∆and E
∆= E −1
(4.21)
E = ∆+ 1
(4.22)
Proof:
Consider the function f(x).
∆f(x) = f(x + h) −f(x)
= Ef(x) −f(x)
= (E −1)f(x)
Therefore,
∆≡E −1

4.4.2
Relation between ∇and E
∇= 1 −E−1
(4.23)
E = (1 −∇)−1
(4.24)
Proof:
Consider the function f(x).
∇f(x) = f(x) −f(x −h)
= f(x) −E−1f(x)
= (1 −E−1)f(x)
Therefore,

Hence shown.

Remark 4.4.4
Relation equ (4.26) can be rewritten as
∆= E∇
E−1∆= E−1E∇
E−1∆= ∇
Therefore
∇= E−1∆
(4.27)
Proof:
Consider the function f(x).
∇f(x) = f(x) −f(x −h) = ∆f(x −h) = ∆E−1f(x)
