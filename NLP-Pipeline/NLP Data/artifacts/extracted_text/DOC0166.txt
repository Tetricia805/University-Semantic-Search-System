CHAPTER ONE: GENERAL INTRODUCTION 
1.0 
 Introduction  
This chapter covered the background of the study, problem statement, purpose of the 
study, objectives of the study, research questions, scope of the study, and definition of 
operational terms on the topic “Holistic Child Ministry and Church: A Case Study of 
Emanuel Rubaya Church of Uganda Parish, Rukore Archdeaconry – Diocese of Kigezi” 
1.1  
Background of the Study 
Emmanuel Rubaya church of Uganda Parish is found in Rukore archdeaconry in the 
Diocese of Kigezi, 
The Diocese was born in 1967, curved out of the then Ankole Kigezi Diocese, and has 
since then given birth to three other Dioceses of North Kigezi (1981), Muhabura Diocese 
(1990), and Kinkiizi Diocese (1995) as it grandchild since it was carved from North Kigezi 
diocese. 
The first Bishop of Kigezi was Rt Rev. Richard Lyth (1967-1972), followed by Bishop 
Festo Kivengyere (1972-1988), Bishop William Rukirande (1988-1997), Bishop George 
Katwesigye (1998-2013), Bishop George Bagamuhunda (2014- May 2022), and the 
current Bishop (Bishop Gaddie Akanjuna (June 2022 to-date).  
Diocese of Kigezi is well known for it has overtime been spiritually rejuvenated by the 
famous outpouring of The Holy Spirit in the 1935 Spiritual Revival, which stimulated its 
unique spiritual growth and direction that is now celebrated worldwide as the East 
African Revival movement. Since 1935, the Church in Kigezi has grown showing 

2 
 
characteristics of the East African revival which centre on evangelical theological 
direction its grip. It is a Church that upholds and exploits spiritual gifts to bear spiritual 
fruits of the Spirit. The work of mission continues to be emphasized and people continue 
to surrender their lives to Christ. The Diocese has upheld holistic Christian values that 
liberate God’s people. 
The Diocese has 17 Archdeaconries, 102 Parishes, and 417 Local Churches. It also has 
25 Chaplaincies that are vibrantly raising children and students in schools and colleges. 
The recent (2023) internal Diocesan Census put the total population at 356,000 people.  
The the archdeaconries include; Rwancerere, Kamuganguzi,Muyebe  Kikungiri All saints 
kabale, Kamuronko, Kizinga, Nyabirerema, Buhangizi, Kihanga, Kantare, St.peters 
Cathedral, Bubare, Nyaruhanga, Muko, Kacerere and Rukore archdeaconry where 
Emmanuel Rubaya church of Uganda Parish is located. 
The Diocese covers the 3 Districts of Kabale, Rukiga, and Rubanda, and the Diocesan 
Headquarters (Diocesan Offices and Cathedral) are located at Rugarama Hill in the 
Centre of Kabale Town.   
Rubaya Church of Uganda started in 1944 at a place called Kyabagara which is found 
currently in kahungye sub county at the top of the hill where its sub parish Kyabagara 
is situated. It was led by late Elinest Bazira, followed by Mr Filipo Butozi and a wife to 
late Rwemera called Elinora Bwandagara.  
In 1946, it was shifted from Kyabagara to kitojo and by then,it was led by Mr Samuel 
Ntonzi. In 1947, it was again shifted from kitojo to the current beautiful place which 

3 
 
was given in by late Bangamwabo in the exchange of the land in kitojo where it was 
built.  
 
In 1950, Rubaya Church of Uganda was granted a sub parish status (muluka) and given 
authority to oversee eleven (11) local churches. These include; -  Murandamo, Bigaaga, 
katojo, Kyabagara, Rwemihanga, Bwaya, Muguri, Rutare, Nyamabare I, Nyamabare II, 
and Rushaabo church of Uganda.  
 
In 1978, Rubaya Church of Uganda was elevated from sub parish status to the Parish 
status and the parish priests who served there to date are here under mentioned and 
the time they spent there; -

1.2  
Problem statement  
It has been observed that children ministry is the most neglected ministry in the church. 
Many churches concentrate on mature Christians because they are the ones who 
contribute financially to the development of the church (Luzinda, 2015).  This is not 
surprising because even Jesus’ disciples wanted to hinder them from accessing him 
(Mark 10:13-14). Research shows that Some Churches that have embraced children 
ministry lack the element of holistic children ministry. Emphasis is put on memorization 
of bible verses but application is lacking. There is no standard curriculum, no official 
teaching materials, no professionally trained teachers, and facilities are also lacking. 
The physical element is lacking because children are not taught healthy issues for 
example taking care of their bodies and avoiding diseases. The social element is lacking 
because children are not given time to interact freely and have no mercy in what they 
do, ego centric in their ways. Also, the cognitive/educational element is neglected for 
example children have no chance to think about their careers and there is no 
development of livelihood skills. (Philip, 2016) According to World Vision the church 
needs to reach out to people and especially children in a holistic way – spiritually, 
physically, socially as well as economically. The church has a responsibility to invest in 
children and the time is now. (Mukhwana, 2015). Available records show that the church 
lacks a strong foundation of children ministry and because of that there are no well-
groomed Christians who can stand the test of time and carry on the church to the 
desired growth. Christians today are swept by all kinds of teaching because they are 
not well groomed spiritually, physically, socially and cognitively. The world lacks adults 
with Christian principles to serve in various positions because they are not well groomed 

5 
 
from childhood. (Mukhwana, 2015). It was against this background that the researcher 
intended to find out the contribution of holistic children ministry towards Church 
growth and find out how holistic children ministry can be improved at Rubaya Church 
of Uganda Parish.

1.5 
Scope of the study 
1.5.1 Geographical scope  
The geographical scope of the study will be Rubaya Church of Uganda Parish, Rukore 
Archdeaconry – diocese of Kigezi.  
1.5.2 Content scope  
The study was focused on the contributions of holistic children ministry to the 
Church, the challenges hindering the holistic development of children ministry 
and the possible solutions to improving holistic children ministry at Rubaya Church 
of Uganda Parish 
1.5.3 Time scope  
This study was done in a period of three months from April to June. The study was 
carried out with a focus on the information from 2014 to 2024. This is a period under 
which holistic children ministry was common in Diocese of Kigezi.   
1.6 Significance of the study  
Holistic children ministry is of great importance because it is the foundation of the 
church. Children who are empowered holistically grow in all spheres of life, that is, 
spiritually, physically, socially and economically.   
This study will be of great importance to the church because it will help in discovering 
how child ministry is being done. The church will be able to identify the possible gaps 
existing within the implementation of holistic child ministry and how they can be 

7 
 
closed. For example, finding professional children’s church teachers who can handle 
the different aspects of holistic children’s ministry.   
The study will help parents and caregivers to understand whether what is being taught 
to their children is holistic or not. They will discover ways through which child ministry 
can be improved holistically for the benefit of the children.   
1.7 Definition of key terms I this topic  
Holistic Child Ministry 
Holistic Child Ministry refers to a child-centered approach practiced within Christian 
communities that seeks to address the spiritual, emotional, physical, and intellectual 
development of children. It goes beyond traditional Sunday school teaching to include 
mentorship, psychosocial support, life skills training, and community engagement. The 
goal is to nurture the whole child in a manner that reflects biblical values and practical 
care (Brewster, 2013; Myers, 2011). 
Church 
In this study, the term “Church” refers to the organized Christian community, 
specifically the Emanuel Rubaya Church of Uganda Parish, functioning within the Rukore 
Archdeaconry of the Diocese of Kigezi. The church serves as both a religious and social 
institution, playing a central role in moral teaching, spiritual growth, and community 
development, particularly for children and youth (Kisembo, 2014). 
 

8 
 
Child Development 
Child development in the context of this study refers to the progressive improvement 
of a child's capabilities across various domains that is,spiritual, cognitive, emotional, 
physical, and social. It emphasizes nurturing children's potential through intentional, 
supportive, and faith-based interventions provided by families, churches, and 
communities (Nabwami, 2020).

CHAPTER TWO: LITERATURE REVIEW 
2.0 
Introduction   
This chapter is the review of the literature related to the topic under study. This 
chapter involves the facts that have already been written about children and church 
growth/ development. 
2.1 Contributions of holistic children ministry to the church  
Research indicates that a person’s lifelong behaviors and beliefs are generally 
developed when they are young particularly before their teenage years.   
Globally, the role of the church in child development has increasingly been recognized 
as a critical aspect of holistic ministry. Holistic child ministry seeks to address the 
spiritual, emotional, physical, and intellectual needs of children within the context of 
faith communities. According to Brewster (2013), holistic child ministry integrates 
biblical teaching with child-focused development strategies to ensure that children 
grow in a nurturing and morally grounded environment. The church, as a spiritual and 
social institution, is uniquely positioned to influence children’s moral behavior, 
character development, and community engagement from a young age. 
In many parts of the world, churches have taken a proactive approach by developing 
child-focused ministries that combine education, health awareness, mentorship, and 
spiritual growth. As per Myers (2011), such initiatives often collaborate with families, 
schools, and community leaders to build a strong support network around the child. In 
contexts where governmental child welfare systems are weak or under-resourced, 

10 
 
churches frequently fill the gap by offering both moral guidance and practical support 
services. This global framework establishes the foundation for understanding the 
importance of holistic child ministry within local church settings such as Emanuel 
Rubaya Church of Uganda Parish. 
In the African context, the church has historically played a significant role in shaping 
the moral and social development of children. African communities, particularly in rural 
settings, regard the church not only as a religious institution but also as a pillar of 
communal life. According to Kasambala (2006), the African church has evolved into a 
center for education, social support, and moral instruction, especially for the young. 
Child-focused ministries have become increasingly necessary in addressing challenges 
such as poverty, family instability, and limited access to formal education. 
In many parts of Africa, churches run Sunday schools, youth fellowships, and 
educational programs aimed at equipping children with life skills and ethical values. A 
study by Moyo & Sibanda (2019) emphasized that holistic child ministry is particularly 
effective when church programs intentionally include mentorship, recreational 
activities, and practical life guidance, thereby helping children avoid societal pitfalls 
like early substance abuse or delinquency. African churches that incorporate a holistic 
approach often report stronger youth engagement and better long-term moral 
outcomes for the children involved. 
Uganda presents a unique context for holistic child ministry due to its strong Christian 
heritage and predominantly young population. The church in Uganda has historically 
played an integral role in education and social welfare, especially in rural communities. 

11 
 
According to Kisembo (2014), Ugandan churches have been central in promoting moral 
development through Sunday school programs, catechism classes, and youth ministry. 
However, rural parishes often lack the resources to implement fully holistic programs, 
leaving many children underserved in terms of comprehensive care and guidance. 
Despite these challenges, churches in Uganda have continued to adapt by engaging in 
community outreach, offering parenting seminars, and launching child sponsorship 
initiatives. A study by Nabwami (2020) found that when churches integrate spiritual 
teachings with practical services like health education and academic support, children 
are more likely to exhibit positive behavioral and academic outcomes. The church is 
therefore a vital actor in ensuring that children not only learn about faith but also 
experience practical love and support from their religious communities. 
Within the Diocese of Kigezi, and specifically the Rukore Archdeaconry, the Emanuel 
Rubaya Church of Uganda Parish stands as a model for grassroots holistic child ministry. 
Located in a rural and mountainous area of southwestern Uganda, the parish has made 
significant efforts to minister to children through integrated programs. According to a 
local report by Rukore Archdeaconry (2023), the church runs a vibrant Sunday school 
and youth fellowship that focus on character formation, biblical literacy, and life skills 
training. These programs are led by dedicated volunteers and lay readers who recognize 
the importance of early moral and spiritual guidance. 
Holistic child ministry in Emanuel Rubaya Parish includes not only spiritual formation 
but also psychosocial support. The church partners with local schools to promote 
education and organizes community health days to raise awareness about nutrition and 

12 
 
hygiene for children. A recent study by Rukore Child Outreach Team (2024) revealed 
that children involved in church programs at Emanuel Rubaya Parish demonstrated 
higher levels of empathy, discipline, and community participation than their peers who 
were not engaged. The church has also initiated peer mentorship groups, where older 
youths guide younger ones in spiritual matters and personal growth, promoting 
intergenerational support within the congregation. 
Moreover, the church actively collaborates with parents and guardians, recognizing that 
holistic child development requires a collective effort. According to Tumuhimbise 
(2023), parental involvement in church-led child programs has led to more stable family 
environments and reduced incidents of behavioral issues among participating children. 
By integrating faith, community service, education, and psychosocial care, Emanuel 
Rubaya Church exemplifies how rural parishes can implement holistic ministry models 
that are contextually relevant and spiritually transformative. 
Research indicates that a person’s lifelong behaviors and beliefs are generally 
developed when they are young particularly before their teenage years.   
According to Barna 2003, a person’s moral foundations are generally in place by age 9. 
After that age, most people simply refine their views. A person’s response to Jesus (and 
the gospel concerning his life, death and resurrection) is usually determined before age 
18. For most Americans, the response is set by age 12. A person’s spiritual beliefs are 
set in place when they are preteens. Those beliefs include the nature of God, the 
existence of Satan, the reliability of the Bible, the afterlife, Jesus Christ, the means of 
gaining God’s favor, and the influence of spiritual forces in a person’s life. (Barna, 2003)  

13 
 
Barna noted that adult church leaders usually had significant involvement in the church 
when they were children. Thus, those who will become the church’s leaders 20 years 
from now are probably active in children’s church programs today. Children ministry 
plays a crucial role in grooming leaders for today and tomorrow. In his journal  
equipping children for ministry, Ted Johnstone says “I was visiting a congregation on 
the East coast and a couple of young girls about age 10 circulated through the 
congregation, receiving the offering in baskets. They then brought the baskets to the 
front and joined an adult to offer a prayer of thanksgiving. They did a marvelous job—
clearly, they had been equipped for this work.” When children are exposed to ministry 
opportunities at an early age, they will serve even in their adult years. (Johnston, 2022)  
Children ministry teaches child discipline for example, it teaches children how to 
respect authority and to have good manners. Discipline is core for the success of any 
child in life and a child cannot get discipline anywhere else apart from the church. 
Psalms 1:7 states that “the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom” following God’s 
laws at an early age allows a child to grow up with discipline and it is through discipline 
that they attain knowledge.  
 
Children’s ministry provides kids with opportunities to help the community, such as 
doing acts of good and feeding the poor. Children learn to offer service to the 
community through Sunday school and other children’s programs. For example, through 
the compassion sponsorship program children are given opportunity to do acts of service 
in the community such as cleaning the well, fetching water for the elderly, cleaning 

14 
 
premises for old people’s homes and distributing some household items to families of 
needy people. ElizabethScott. (2022).  
 
Children ministry gives a chance to children to accept Jesus Christ. Research has proven 
that kids tend to be more receptive to the Gospel than any other age group. Belief in 
Jesus at a tender age, helps children to avoid some negative outcomes of sin. Only 
God’s grace can change our hearts, but knowing the consequences of disobeying God is 
often a wakeup call. When children understand the great price that Jesus paid for their 
salvation, they are more likely to stay on the way of the righteous. ElizabethScott. 
(2022).  
 
Children ministry helps children to make new friends. Children ministry helps children 
to meet together through different activities, as they participate in those activities, 
they get to know each other and make friendships. Friendships made at church at such 
an early age are usually lasting friendships. For example, children supported by 
agencies such as world vision and compassion international are exposed to different 
programs both spiritual, physical, social and educational which help them to interact 
with each other hence forming long lasting friendships that even help them in the future 
long after their education. (Sharma, 2023)  
It helps children to discover and intervene in abusive home situations. This is something 
we rarely address. But the church is often one of the few safe places on Earth for abused 
children. The church is a place where children can easily interact with their teachers 

15 
 
and through this interaction teachers are able to discover what takes place within a 
child’s life. These interactions help children to share their stories about their homes 
and community hence when there is abuse in a child’s life, the teacher is able to 
discover it and take appropriate measures to rescue the child. (Sharma, 2023)  
 
Children ministry supports Godly parenting. Godly parenting is very crucial for raising 
God fearing children with both knowledge and discipline. This is done through parent/ 
caregiver seminars which are intended to educate parents and caregivers about their 
role in parenting. The church was never meant to be the exclusive faith teacher of 
children. Instead, God’s plan was for the two institutions (church and family) to form a 
partnership. Through these seminars parents and caregivers are helped to fulfil their 
calling by involving them in the ministry, providing them with resources and training 
them in family discipleship which helps parents and caregivers to carry on the ministry 
outside church premises which is very crucial in ministry sustainability. (Caplan, 1989)  
Holistic child ministry helps caregivers to acquire some skills through sensitizations. 
Children ministry programs which emphasize parent/ caregiver involvement usually 
help in empowering them with different skills through sensitizations. For example, 
through compassion international children ministry, parents and caregivers are usually 
invited for sensitizations such as nutritional sensitizations, family planning 
sensitizations and disease prevention sensitizations. Such skills have a great impact on 
family and community. They help families to know the number of children they should 
have at a given time depending on the available resources. They learn how to feed their 

16 
 
children on the foods that are appropriate for their age so that they grow as healthy 
vessels for the work of God. (Ministry, 2023)  
 
Holistic child ministry brings unchurched families in contact with the Gospel. In our 
culture, reaching children is one of the most effective ways to make contact with 
unchurched families. A children’s program at church acts as a point of contact between 
the church and the children’s families. Churches with such programs usually also have 
times when they do home visitations, through home visitations, they are able to 
minister to the entire family, that is, the siblings and the parents/ caregivers. In so 
doing the gospel is spread to the entire family. For example, the World outreach 
ministry has reached more than three billion people through its children’s ministry since 
1932 (Ministry, 2023)   
Holistic child ministry helps the church to pass on the faith. In every period of church 
history, this has been a struggle. Children’s ministry helps the church in raising a 
generation of Christians who deeply understand their faith. This is achieved when the 
church has a comprehensive plan for Christian education. The Sunday school curriculum 
is very essential in helping children acquire spiritual knowledge necessary to equip them 
with the basic biblical knowledge. This curriculum is designed according to the church 
calendar hence it helps the children to learn the church seasons from advent through 
easter, Pentecost and Trinity. (Barna, 2003)  
Holistic child ministry helps train future church leaders. When children are given chance 
to lead their peers through bible reading, leading praise, leading small groups, leading 

17 
 
intercessions among others, they acquire leadership skills that will even help them 
when they are adults. Leadership skills allow children to have control of their lives and 
the ability to make things happen. Leadership instills confidence, and helps children 
solve problems creatively, work in a team, and work collaboratively with others. 
Leadership gives children many opportunities to develop responsibility. There is some 
debate whether some children are “born leaders” or they “learn to be” leaders. All 
children have the potential to develop leadership skills. Leadership development can 
be a lifelong process. As adults, we can teach the skills necessary for children to take 
on leadership roles now and in the future. (Care, 2019)  
 
Holistic child ministry raises community awareness of the church through special 
events. Special events such as sports gala, music dance and drama attract people from 
all walks of life and as they come for such events, they become aware of the church 
and its programs. Events such as talent competitions – a day where kids get together to 
showcase their talents is a great church event idea to get parents and children involved. 
It even brings on board the elderly (grandma and grandpa) as cheerers of their precious 
little ones. (Sharma, 2023)  
 Holistic child ministry helps big church go smoothly. Quality childcare is essential to 
allow parents to participate fully in the church worship service. As children are being 
attended to by their teachers, parents and caregivers, get time to concentrate in the 
adult service. Some churches which are more advanced have child care centers for even 
toddlers. For example, churches in Chicago western suburbs give parents the 

18 
 
opportunity to embrace weekly religious services without the struggle of caring their 
children. Drop-off nurseries and children’s Bible school for preschool-aged children give 
parents the ability to connect with their faith, all while knowing their children are being 
cared for.  ElizabethScott. (2022).  
Holistic child ministry helps build a strong youth ministry. Children who grow up in child 
ministry become leaders in the student ministry. Children ministry produces vibrant 
youth who carry on the youth ministry as youth leaders, choir leaders, church machine 
operators and even Sunday school teachers. There can never be a vibrant youth ministry 
in a church where there is no vibrant children ministry. An intentional focus on 
children’s and youth ministry results in more young people growing in their maturity of 
faith, more young people inviting their friends to church, and more young people 
continuing in their faith post high school. The Anglican Church in Australia has declared 
that “We are seeing young people influencing their parents and whole households 
coming to investigate Christ and his church through the godly witness of their children. 
Additionally, we are seeing all age groups in the church flourish as disciples of Jesus as 
they witness and participate in the church’s investment in ministry to children and 
youth.” (Beilharz, 2021)  
 
Holistic child ministry allows for age-graded instruction. A tried-and-true way to 
promote learning is to teach on different maturity levels. Grouping children of the same 
age in a class is believed to meet the learning needs of the majority, the assumption 
being that children of the same age have similar levels of socio-emotional and cognitive 

19 
 
development; that their early childhood developmental trajectories, as well as inputs 
from their home environment, prepare them equally to meet the demands of formal 
schooling. Curricular expectations and teaching-learning materials are designed based 
on this assumption. (Thomas, 2022)  
2.3 The challenges hindering the holistic development of children ministry  
A critical challenge is the scarcity of adequately trained personnel to manage and lead 
children's ministry programs. Many church leaders and volunteers lack formal training 
in child development and pedagogy, leading to suboptimal delivery of ministry 
activities. This gap in expertise affects the effectiveness of spiritual and moral guidance 
provided to children (Kisembo, 2014). 
In some communities, children are not perceived as active participants in church life. 
This cultural mindset leads to their marginalization in decision-making processes and 
ministry activities. Such attitudes undermine efforts to engage children holistically, 
limiting their opportunities for spiritual and personal growth within the church setting 
(Kasambala, 2006).  
The physical infrastructure of many rural churches, including Emanuel Rubaya Parish, 
is often inadequate to support children's ministry programs. Lack of proper classrooms, 
play areas, and sanitation facilities creates an environment that is not conducive to 
effective learning and development for children (Rukore Archdeaconry report, 2023). 
Parental engagement is crucial for the holistic development of children. However, many 
parents in the community are either unaware of or indifferent to the importance of 

20 
 
their involvement in their children's spiritual education. This lack of participation 
hinders the reinforcement of church teachings at home, affecting the overall 
development of children (Nabwami, 2020). 
The prevailing socio-economic hardships faced by families in the region contribute to 
children's neglect in ministry programs. Economic constraints force children to 
prioritize labor over education and spiritual activities, leading to absenteeism and 
disengagement from church programs (Nanteza, 2020). 
Gender biases within the community can lead to unequal opportunities for boys and 
girls in participating in church activities. Girls, in particular, may face cultural 
restrictions that limit their involvement in certain programs, thereby hindering their 
holistic development (Kasambala, 2016). 
The lack of a structured and consistent approach to children's ministry results in 
fragmented and ineffective programs. Without a clear curriculum and regular activities, 
children receive disjointed teachings, which diminishes the impact of the ministry on 
their development (Rukore Archdeaconry reports, 2023). 
Many children in the community face emotional and psychological challenges, yet the 
church lacks formal counseling services to address these issues. The absence of trained 
counselors and structured programs leaves children without the necessary support to 
navigate personal difficulties (Kisembo, 2014). 
Children are often exposed to negative peer influences that conflict with the values 
taught in church. The church's limited engagement with the broader community makes 

21 
 
it challenging to counteract these influences effectively, leading to moral and 
behavioral isses among children (Mwita & Mwikali, 2022). 
 
The integration of technology in children's ministry is minimal, limiting the church's 
ability to engage children through modern educational tools. Incorporating technology 
could enhance learning experiences and make ministry programs more appealing to the 
younger generation (Brewster, 2013). 
The church's outreach programs often fail to reach all children in the community, 
especially those from marginalized backgrounds. This exclusion prevents a significant 
portion of the child population from benefiting from the church's holistic development 
initiatives (Rukore Archdeaconry reports, 2023). 
The absence of adequate spiritual role models within the church community affects 
children's moral and spiritual development. Without positive examples to emulate, 
children may struggle to internalize and practice the teachings imparted during ministry 
programs (Kasambala, 2016). 
There is often an overemphasis on academic success at the expense of spiritual and 
moral education. This imbalance leads to the neglect of holistic development, where 
children's emotional and spiritual needs are overlooked in favor of academic 
performance (Nabwami, 2020). 

22 
 
Resistance to adopting new methodologies and approaches in children's ministry hinders 
progress. Traditional practices and reluctance to innovate can prevent the church from 
implementing effective programs that address the evolving needs of children in the 
community (Kisembo, 2014). 
2.3 The possible ways through which holistic children ministry can be improved at 
churches  
 Children ministry can be improved through a holistic approach to ensure each child’s 
individual needs are supported, holistic child ministry is tailored to a child’s age, 
gender, health, culture and family situation. When a child is enrolled in child ministry, 
they should receive spiritual guidance through the church, but should also be helped 
through family support programs to have access to nutritious food, access to clean 
water, quality health care and emotional support, alongside education and skills-based 
training. For example, Compassion’s holistic child development model is designed to 
help children grow up to become thriving followers of Jesus who are positively 
influencing their world. its programs focus not only on the spiritual but also the social 
emotional, physical and cognitive aspects. (Noakes, 2022)  
In order to improve children ministry, there is need to develop and equip a team to 
carry on the ministry. This should be done prayerfully by identifying and extending a 
personal invitation to potential coworkers. When you ask someone to join the team, 
tell them what’s expected, clarify what they will do, and describe how they’ll be 
supported and trained. The church should identify children ministry workers who 
qualify, who have a good moral background and invest in training them and giving them 

23 
 
refresher courses so that they effectively do the ministry as required. Building and 
equipping a children’s ministry team also involves motivation, supervision and 
supporting the team with resources. (Linda, 2016)  
Improving children’s Ministry requires a compelling vision. A clear and compelling vision 
statement tells people what you aspire to achieve – why you exist – what is the good 
you seek to create in the world. It also tells those you want to convince to join you for 
example, funders, partners, clients/audiences why what you are doing is important. To 
envision is to imagine, plan beforehand, or ponder the possibilities. What has God 
placed in your heart and mind? People need to know the why and where of children 
ministry is. A clear vision helps the congregation visualize a future that’s appealing and 
captivating which enables them to support the ministry.    
Children ministry should be Christ-centered and Scripture-rich. Major in the Gospels, 
especially with younger children. Bible studies should prioritize knowing and growing a 
relationship with Jesus. Avoid curriculum that emphasizes values, morals, heroes, or 
behavior modification. The bible has everything needed for the holistic development of 
a person. 2Timothy 3:16-17 states “all Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for 
teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the servant of God 
may be thoroughly equipped for every good work. The bible is the source of all the 
wisdom needed to thrive in this world. When children have a strong spiritual foundation, 
they can thrive well in other aspects. (Land, 1975)  
Children ministry can be improved though developing a strategy. You can’t accomplish 
your vision without a strategy. Every children’s ministry needs a plan to achieve the 

24 
 
overall aim. Work with stakeholders (children, Parents, grandparents, teachers, and 
senior leaders) to figure out how you will “reach, rescue, root and release children to 
grab hold of their inheritance in Christ and transform their world through His power.” 
A written strategy for “reaching, rescuing, rooting and releasing children to grab hold 
of their inheritance in Christ and transform their world through His power” is essential 
for the health and growth of children’s ministry in the local church. Research indicates 
that most local churches are running programs and activities; yet don’t have a 
deliberate short- and long-term plan for evangelizing and discipline children. A good 
child ministry strategy includes planning for new members, child safety, making child 
ministry interesting by including play, investing in a curriculum among others.  
(Union, 2019)  
Children should be taught how to read the bible using bible reading guides. This helps 
them to develop a bible reading culture at an early age. The guide also helps them to 
interpret the scripture in the right context. For example, scripture union guides have 
helped many people to read the bible over the years. Scripture union resources such as 
God and me, daily power and daily guide are useful resources that can help children as 
they study and read the word of God. (Linda, 2016)   
In order to improve children ministry, families must be supported as partners in the 
ministry. Parents/ caregivers should be helped to embrace and excel as the primary 
disciples of their children. There is need to share the best resources for families. 
Children ministry workers/ church leaders should provide advice, assistance, spiritual 
counsel, and a deeper level of dialogue about family faith formation. For example, host 
seminars on parenting, have a Sunday morning class focused on family concerns, sponsor 

25 
 
a parent’s night out or morning out, provide childcare for all church events, offer a 
support group for new parents, have an annual family retreat or camping trip. (Caplan, 
1989)  
Improving children ministry involves reaching children and families beyond your church 
in order to achieve this the church can organize general children’s events that are 
focused at attracting other children form the community not necessarily those from the 
local congregation for example giving printed invitations to families so that they invite 
their friends, school visitations by the pastors and children workers. When you do 
outreaches to schools, children get to know you and they will follow you at the church. 
Use motivational gifts such as sending birthday cards to families with children. Rather 
than waiting for kids to come to church, take ministry to where kids already are. To 
attract unchurched kids, consider locating activities in a store front, park, or 
recreational center. (Barna, 2003)   
In order for children ministry to thrive, it should be inclusive. Welcome children of all 
abilities, exceptionalities, ethnicities, and backgrounds. Make your activities accessible 
to children with different needs. Pay special attention to children in the margins. No 
action or interaction is insignificant. Create space and opportunities for participation. 
In accordance with their gifts and abilities, involve children as active contributors to 
the church’s mission. (Elizabeth Scott, 2022)

CHAPTER THREE: RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 
 3.0 
 Introduction  
This chapter consisted of the methods which were employed while carrying out the 
study. It discussed different aspects such as research design, study area, study 
population, sample size and determination, sampling techniques and procedure, data 
collection methods, data quality control, data analysis and research procedure.  
 3.1  Research design   
According to Denvir and Millett (2003), research design provides the glue that holds the 
research project together. It is a scheme, an outline or plan that is used to generate 
answers to a research problem or phenomena. An institution based cross- sectional 
study design was adopted. The design applied both qualitative and quantitative 
methods to data collection and analysis. A cross-sectional design is a kind of design that 
involves measuring different variables in the population of interest at a single point in 
time. The design is suitable for the study because it helped in determining the 
relationship between variables. Quantitative methods involved the use of questionnaire 
to capture quantifiable responses while the qualitative approach involved the use of 
interview to the Christians, children workers/ volunteers and church leaders in the 
parish to know the current state of holistic children ministry, its contributions church 
and how was to be improved.  

27 
 
 3.2  Study area   
The study area covered a particular area with focus on Emmanuel Rubaya Church of 
Uganda Parish, Rukore Archdeaconry-Kigezi Diocese   
3.3  
Study population  
Study population is a group of individuals, objects or items from which samples will be 
taken for measurement (Kombo and Tromp 2011). The study population comprised of 
parents/care takers of children attending Sunday school at Emmanuel Rubaya church 
of Uganda Parish and other key informants like church leaders, child ministry workers 
and Sunday school teachers. These provided the necessary information required for the 
study.  
3.4  
Sample determination   
The target sample was drawn using a sample determination table by Krejcie & Morgan 
at 95% level of confidence, with 5% as the tolerable error. A sample size of 36 
respondents was determined through purposive and random sampling methods. This 
was so because the nature of data to be generated required different techniques for 
better understanding of the research problem under investigation. Besides this the 
approach was also commonly known for achieving higher degree of validity and 
reliability as well as elimination of biases as per Amin (2005). The sample size was 
determined    using the formula derived by Krejcie and Morgan (1970), as shown in the 
table below;

3.6 
Sampling Procedure   
Musoke et al., (2014) defines sampling as the plan on how units or elements within a 
population will be picked as to form part of the study. The study used both simple 
random and purposive sampling techniques to arrive at the required number of 
respondents.   
The researcher used simple random sampling (where the researcher uses non-
probability methods) in the selection of respondents. This was achieved by getting a 
list of parents/care takers of children with the help of Sunday school teachers on the 

30 
 
day of data collection. Each parent’s name was assigned a random number and it’s from 
the random numbers that the researcher selected the required number of respondents.  
Simple random sampling method was used because it was the best in dealing with large 
number of respondents as it saved time and costs.   
Purposive sampling method (where the researcher chooses respondents basing on the 
characteristics) was used for key informants because it is a method that helps in 
gathering data from respondents with more knowledge about a specific phenomenon. 
Key informants in this case provided supplementary information that will not be 
provided by other respondent categories.   
3.7 Source of Data  
Data was gathered from both primary and secondary sources. Primary data was 
collected from the respondent’s using questionnaire and interviews. Secondary 
information on the other hand was collected from sources like; child health registers, 
text books, internet, newspaper, magazines, and journals. This information was 
reviewed by visiting places like libraries and internet cafes and is used to supplement 
the collected data from different categories of the respondents.  
 3.8 Data Collection Methods   
This study used questionnaires and interviews for data collection.   
 3.8.1 Questionnaire   
The study utilized a semi-structured questionnaire to gather data from the respondents. 
The questionnaire consisted of both open and closed ended questions which were filled 

31 
 
by respondents through writing down their responses. The questions in this tool were 
originally designed in English and later translated into local languages to make the 
questions more simple, clear and understandable to the respondents. The questionnaire 
was given to the respondents in order to gather more reliable data as the respondents 
was allowed to answer in their own language and time without being frightened by the 
researcher’s presence. Secondly, it was used because of being cheap as well as collects 
responses with minimum errors and high level of confidentiality. The instrument was 
divided into sections that included background information of the respondents, church 
Sunday school programs available at the church, effect of Sunday school programs on 
spiritual growth among children and factors limiting success of Sunday school programs 
and how it can be improved.  
3.8.2 Interview Guide  
An interview guide was drafted with questions that the researcher asked during 
interview sessions with key respondents. The researcher administered interviews to the 
key informants with a help of an interview guide reflecting the study objectives. With 
this instrument, the researcher engaged in key respondents in oral questions. The 
interviews were used widely to supplement and extend the researchers’ knowledge 
about individual (s) thoughts, feelings and behaviors. While interviewing, probing was 
applied in cases where respondents do not give inadequate answers. This method was 
used to gather data about the current state of holistic child ministry, challenges faced 
and how it can improve.  

32 
 
3.9 Data Quality Control   
The quality of data was controlled through two major principles that is validity and 
reliability  
3.9.1  Validity of instruments  
According to Latunji and Akinyemi, (2018) validity is a demonstration that a particular 
instrument measures what it intends to measure. To ensure validity of the instruments, 
the researcher consulted two experienced senior researchers and find out whether they 
gave the information that seek to answer questions of the study. Content Validity Index 
(CVI) was computed to establish validity of the instruments.  
3.9.2 Reliability of Instruments   
Reliability is the tendency to obtain the same results if the measure is to be repeated 
by using the same subjects under the same conditions (Hjelmand Atwine, 2011). For 
the case of the study, reliability is ensured by standardizing the questionnaire through 
pre-testing. Questionnaires were pre-tested from a sample outside the target sample 
but with similar or close demographic characteristics to those of the study area. 
Reliability of the questionnaire in relation to the consistency of the respondents’ 
answers was computed using the Cronbach’s Alpha Coefficient.  
3.10 Data management and analysis  
3.10.1 Data Management  
The data collected was cleaned, edited and coded to avoid incompleteness during 
entry. Minor mistakes committed during data collection were corrected in the field. 

33 
 
Upon the completion of data collection and editing in the field, systematic organization 
of raw data was done to facilitate data analysis. Questionnaires with missing variables, 
information or mistakes were left out.  
3.10.2 Data Analysis  
Data was analyzed under two major principles that is quantitative and qualitative 
analysis   
 3.10.3 Quantitative Data Analysis   
The data collected have been cleaned, coded and demographic characteristics of the 
respondents were described using largely descriptive statistics such as frequencies and 
percentages. Bivariate analysis was used to identify the significant factors limiting 
success of Sunday school programs. The outcome of the analysis was presented in 
statistical tables.  
 3.10.4 Qualitative Data Analysis   
Qualitative data was analyzed by developing themes (headings) or sub themes, which 
was derived from the study objectives. The recorded information was transcribed 
verbatim and translated from local languages into English. Observational field notes 
were incorporated into the data for analysis. The transcripts have been read repeatedly 
and words with similar meanings grouped into categories. Similar categories were 
grouped into themes and subthemes which were presented as results  

34 
 
3.11 Research Procedure  
The study was approved by Department of Theology, Uganda Christian University Bishop 
Barham University College – Kabale. Further approval was obtained from the leaders of 
Emanuel church Rubaya Church of Uganda and finally informed consent from the 
participants themselves. Participants were guaranteed confidentiality of the 
information collected. This was preceded by thorough explanation of the aim and 
objective of the study. Participation was based on informed and voluntary consent. 
Respondents for the study were informed of their right to withdraw from the study at 
any time they deemed necessary. They were fully assured of their confidentiality and 
anonymity. Confidentiality of data was maintained by use of identification numbers 
rather than names and limiting access to the data. The questionnaire administered to 
the in-patients were prefaced with a consent form requesting consent of the 
respondents before participation in the study.  
3.12  Ethical Consideration  
Confidentiality of the information was provided to the respondents. To ascertain the 
practice of ethics in this study, the following activities were implemented by the 
researcher.  
All the questionnaires to the respondents were coded instead of reflecting the names 
that provided anonymity of the respondents.  
 
 

35 
 
CHAPTER FOUR: DATA PRESENTATION AND ANALYSIS OF FINDINGS 
4.0  
Introduction 
This chapter presented the analysis and interpretation of the results obtained from the 
field study of investigating the distribution of holistic children ministry to the church 
with particular focus on Emmanuel Rubaya church of Uganda Parish. Questionnaires 
were administered to 36 respondents. All the thirty-six respondents ably answered and 
returned the questionnaires giving a response rate of 100%. 
4.1 Social- economic characteristics of respondents. 
This sub-section presents the social – economic features of 36(thirty-six respondents 
sampled. The key demographic characteristics captured for the study included; gender, 
age bracket, marital status, education levels, occupation, employment status, house 
hold size and the type of house hold. These features were found to be of great help in 
clearly depicting the diverse background of the sample population.

Gender of Respondents 
Out of the 36 respondents, 14 (38.9%) were male while 22 (61.1%) were female. The 
higher number of female respondents may be attributed to the fact that women are 
often more involved in children’s ministry programs within church settings. In many 
rural Ugandan churches, mothers play a more active role in Sunday school, caregiving, 
and community-based child support initiatives, making them more accessible and 
engaged during such studies. 
Respondents’ Age Bracket 
The age distribution shows that 15 respondents (41.7%) were under 23 years, 5 (13.9%) 
were between 24-35 years, and 16 (44.4%) were aged 35 and above. The significant 
number of respondents under 23 reflects the involvement of youth and young adults in 
church activities, particularly as volunteers in children’s ministry. Meanwhile, the 
strong representation of those above 35 indicates the influence of older adults and 
parents, who often serve as mentors, leaders, or teachers in church programs. 
Marital Status of Respondents 
The majority of respondents were married, making up 21 (58.3%) of the total, while 15 
(41.7%) were single. There were no respondents who identified as separated or 
widowed. The high proportion of married individuals is likely due to the demographic 
composition of the church community, where adult, family-oriented members are more 

38 
 
engaged in church leadership and children’s ministry. Their marital status allows them 
to relate more directly with parenting and child development issues, which are central 
to the study. 
Level of Education 
Regarding education levels, 5 respondents (13.9%) had no formal education, 15 (41.7%) 
had primary education, 10 (27.8%) had secondary education, and 11 (30.6%) had 
university education. This distribution suggests a mixed educational background within 
the parish. The predominance of primary education aligns with the rural setting of the 
parish, where access to higher education may be limited. However, the presence of 
respondents with university education is notable and may indicate increasing 
educational attainment among younger or urban-connected members of the parish. 
Occupation/Livelihood Source 
In terms of occupation, 10 respondents (27.8%) were farmers, 5 (13.9%) earned salaries, 
6 (16.7%) were involved in business, and 15 (41.7%) reported having no source of 
income. Farming is a common livelihood in rural Uganda and therefore features 
prominently. The high number of respondents without any occupation suggests a 
considerable level of economic dependency or unemployment, which could include 
students, stay-at-home caregivers, or youth. This socio-economic challenge may impact 
the effectiveness of children’s ministry due to financial constraints in supporting church 
programs. 
 

39 
 
Type of Household 
All 36 respondents (100%) reported coming from male-headed households, with none 
from female-headed or other types of households. This complete dominance of male-
headed households reflects the traditional patriarchal structure that is prevalent in 
rural Ugandan societies, where men are culturally recognized as the heads of families. 
This has implications for how decisions regarding children's spiritual development and 
participation in church activities are made, as male household heads may influence 
family-level engagement with church programs. 
4.2 
 The contribution of holistic children ministry programme to Emmanuel 
Rubaya Church of Uganda Parish. 
This section of the study addresses research objective two which sought to determine 
the the contribution of children ministry programs on church growth. 
David Tiwangye the senior warden of Emmanuel Rubaya church of Uganda Parish a 67-
year man said that children ministry programs are breeding ground for potential leaders 
for the church and community. He emphasized this by setting himself that he was once 
part of the Sunday school during his young age. He added that, the knowledge he gained 
was still helping him even in his old age. 
Moureen Tugume a church warden of Kagoogo church of Uganda in Rubaya church of 
Uganda Parish said that, child ministry offers children an opportunity to meet and 
socialize. She added that it’s important because it improves the mind capacity, social 
skills in a way that, it reduces the ego- centric nature in them. 

40 
 
Meble Tubenawe the Sunday School teacher said that, children ministry curriculum 
deepens children’s understanding of Christianity and morality thus, children would not 
be taken by churches with cultsand false teachings in future. 
Dorcus Baine the Youth leader in Emmanuel Rubaya church of Uganda Parish said that,
