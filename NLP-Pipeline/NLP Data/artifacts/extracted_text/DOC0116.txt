CHAPTER FIVE 
5.1Introduction 
In this chapter, we focus on the implementation of the bus ticket booking app, including print 
screens of the application interface, system testing, validation, and an exploration of its 
limitations. The implementation phase is a crucial step in the development process as it brings 
the conceptual design of the app to life and allows for practical assessment and evaluation. 
 
5.2Print Screen 
The following illustrations show how the user interacts with the bus ticketing application. 
This page is the first page of the application once opened. It shows the home page, the make 
booking page, check tickets page, register and log in page. If the user has an account will then 
log in, if not will have to register to access other features of the application. 
 
 
 
 

26 
 
 
This page shows the customer register page if they don’t have an account they can create one 
from here and then after that proceed to the log in page to get access into the system 
 
 
 
This page shows the Customer log in panel once they have an account they can log in, it also 
shows the register button in case they don’t have an account they can register and also this page 
shows the admin log in button for the admin to log into the application 

27 
 
 
 
After logging in the client can now be able to access the application and then therefore make 
their bookings respectively. They can select the date, origin, destination and they can see various 
available routes that are available and they can then search for tickets. 
 After selecting the date, origin and destination they can then proceed and select seats basing on 
what they want and also the clients can be able to see what bus they will use, the arrival time and 
the price  

28 
 
This shows the route, destination terminal, date and time selected, the seats of the passenger, the 
price and then after the client proceeds to another page  
 
After that the clients ticket booking code will be displayed and can either download the Q-R 
code or then check payment for the ticket.  
 

29 
 
 
This page the client can make payments for their tickets using their bank account number and 
they select a bank and also attach a transaction photo as proof of payment.  
 
 
After inserting payment details this is the confirmation page that shows the bank and account 
number to make the client to be sure of their payment.  

30 
 
After paying for the ticket the clients can check their pending tickets from this page to see if they 
have been accepted or declined and also, they can make payments of their tickets. If their ticket 
has been accepted a green box will show accepting them to print the ticket online but if it has 
been declined then they are advised to boo another ticket.  
 
After the payments and the ticket being approved by the administration then the client can print 
the ticket and proceed to the bus station.

5.3 System testing 
Functionality Testing: 
• Verify that users can search for available bus routes and schedules. 
• Test the booking process, including seat selection, fare calculation, and payment inte-
gration. 
• Validate the cancellation and refund process. 
• Ensure that user authentication, registration, and login functionalities work as ex-
pected. 
Compatibility Testing: 
• Test the app on different devices (e.g., smartphones, tablets) and operating systems 
(e.g., Android, iOS) to ensure compatibility. 
• Check the app's responsiveness and compatibility with various screen sizes and reso-
lutions. 
Performance Testing: 
• Assess the app's performance under normal and peak load conditions. 
• Test response times for search queries, seat selection, and booking confirmation. 
• Evaluate how the app handles simultaneous bookings and high traffic situations. 
 
5.4 Validation 
1. User Registration: 
o Verify that all required fields (e.g., name, email, password) are filled in. 
o Validate the email format (e.g., check for proper email syntax). 
o Check that the password meets the specified criteria (e.g., minimum length, pres-
ence of special characters). 
 
 

32 
 
2. Bus Selection: 
o Ensure that the selected origin and destination are different. 
o Validate that the selected departure and return dates are in the future. 
o Check that the number of passengers selected is within the allowed range. 
o Verify that the selected bus route is available. 
 
3. Seat Selection: 
o Validate that the selected seats are not already booked by other users. 
o Ensure that the selected seats are within the available seating layout for the cho-
sen bus. 
o Check that the selected seats are adjacent (if required) for passengers traveling to-
gether. 
 
4. Payment: 
o Validate the credit card information provided by the user. 
o Verify that the card number is in the correct format and passes the checksum algo-
rithm. 
o Check the card's expiration date to ensure it is valid. 
o Validate the CVV (Card Verification Value) or CVC (Card Verification Code) for 
the card. 
 
5. Confirmation: 
o Display a summary of the booking details for the user to review before confirm-
ing. 
o Provide an option to modify any selected options or go back to previous steps. 
o Require the user to confirm the booking before proceeding. 

33 
 
 
6. Error Handling: 
o Display appropriate error messages for any invalid or missing inputs. 
o Validate that the user has entered a valid email address for communication pur-
poses. 
o Ensure that the user receives error messages if there are any connectivity issues or 
server errors. 
 
5.5 limitations 
• Limited Coverage: Not all bus operators and routes may be fully covered by bus ticketing 
applications. Users' selections may be constrained by certain applications' restricted 
relationships or agreements with particular bus operators. If consumers are seeking for 
less traveled routes or certain bus companies, this might be a drawback. 
• Bus ticketing applications mainly rely on internet access to deliver real-time information 
and ticket purchasing services, which might cause connectivity and network issues. Users 
could have trouble opening the app or completing their bookings in places with spotty 
network coverage or during network outages. 
• Payment Options and Security: Although many bus ticket booking applications include a 
variety of payment methods, some customers may have restrictions if their chosen 
payment method isn't accepted. Users may also be concerned about the security of their 
financial information and the app's capacity to fend against data breaches and illegal 
access. 
• Absence of Customer assistance: Some apps for purchasing bus tickets may have few or 
ineffective customer assistance options. Users may encounter difficulties asking for help 
or resolving problems with their reservations, which can cause irritation and 
disappointment.

6.3 Summary. 
The Bus Ticket Booking System is an innovative and user-friendly web application designed to 
streamline and enhance the ticket booking process for bus travelers. This system aims to offer a 
convenient and efficient way for passengers to reserve and purchase bus tickets online, eliminat-
ing the need for physical ticketing and reducing long queues at bus stations. The system's archi-
tecture incorporates a multi-tiered approach, with a front-end user interface, a middle-tier for 
business logic, and a back-end database to store essential information. Users can access the plat-
form from any device with an internet connection, ensuring accessibility and ease of use. 
Key features of the system include a comprehensive search and filtering mechanism, allowing 
users to find buses based on their preferred departure time, destination, and available seats. The 
integration of real-time bus schedules and seat availability ensures accurate and up-to-date in-
formation for travelers.  
Security measures are a top priority in the system's development. Sensitive data, such as payment 
information, is encrypted to protect users from potential threats and ensure secure transactions  
However, future improvements are recommended to further enhance the system. Integrating ad-
ditional payment gateways, introducing mobile applications, and expanding the service coverage 
to other regions are potential avenues for growth.
