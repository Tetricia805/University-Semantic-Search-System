ABSTRACT 
 
Residents of Bunyangabu District in Uganda have reportedly suffered from cases of dental fluorosis 
due to consumption of water with high levels of Fluoride from Ntabago Stream. A household-level sand filter 
incorporating crushed fired clay as an adsorbent was designed for a household to reduce the Fluoride 
concentration in their drinking water from the natural raw water levels (2-3 mgF/L) to permissible, healthy 
levels (0.5-1.0 mg/L). Pieces of fired clay bricks were crushed, and particles of 150 µm to 300 µm in size were 
selectively obtained by sieving. Stream water was filtered through replicate model layered filter columns of the 
prepared clay, sand (fine sand of 150 µm-2 mm; coarse sand of 2-5 mm), and gravel (6-15 mm). It was found 
out that fired clay layers of 2.5 and 5 cm thick reduce the concentration of Fluoride in water by up to 74%, to 
less than 1.0 mg/L. This was deduced by evaluating Fluoride concentration in both the clay and water before 
and after filtration, using the SPADNS Colorimetric method. Use of crushed fired clay for reduction in 
Fluoride concentration in drinking water is the focus of this paper. Additional work will optimise filter design 
to improve overall water quality.

INTRODUCTION 
Fluoride is found in all natural waters 
at varying concentrations (Djossou et al., 
2015; Hisseien et al., 2015). Seawater 
generally contains about 1.0 mg/L, while 
rivers and lakes mostly exhibit concentrations 
of less than 0.5 mg/L. In groundwater 
however, low and high concentration of 
Fluorides can occur, depending on the nature 
of the rocks and the occurrence of Fluoride-
bearing rocks (Djossou et al., 2015). Many of 
the lakes of the African Rift Valley especially 
the soda lakes, have extremely high Fluoride 
concentration. 
Geographical areas around the world 
that have concentrations of Fluoride include 
Syria, Jordan, Egypt, Libya, Algeria and 
Morocco. It also includes the rift valley area 
in Africa from Sudan through Kenya to 
Tanzania and Malawi. Another geographical 
area extends from Turkey through Iraq, Iran 
and Afghanistan to India, northern Thailand 
and China. The most affected areas by 
Fluoride include India, China and Rift Valley 

E. WOZEI et al. / Int. J. Biol. Chem. Sci. 15(7): 82-89, 2021 
 
83 
countries in Africa (Demelash et al., 2019; 
Mosonik, 2015).  
In Uganda, 6.45% of the water sources 
exceed the standard value of Fluoride in 
drinking water. The maximum value of 
Fluoride in these waters is reported to be 3.31 
mg/L and the most affected areas include 
volcanic areas of Elgon, Mbale, Moroto and 
the Rift Valley of western Uganda (Malago et 
al., 2017). 
Preliminary tests carried out in October 
2018 on water from Ntabago Stream in 
Western Uganda showed concentrations of 
Fluoride between 2 mg/L to 3 mg/L, which 
has led to fluorosis and discolouration of teeth 
for the residents consuming the water (Figure 
1). According to the Ugandan Standard 
(UNBS, 2008), this range is greater than the 
permissible levels (0.5 mg/L to 1.0 mg/L for 
potable treated water, and 1.5 mg/L for 
potable untreated water). This has made the 
water unsafe for human consumption due to 
high concentration of Fluoride in water (Das 
and Mondal, 2016). 
The National Water and Sewerage 
Corporation (NWSC) has provided piped 
water, but because of the cost attached, the 
residents prefer free water from this stream to 
piped water, which makes them susceptible to 
health 
risks 
associated 
with 
Fluoride 
contamination 
(Table 
1). 
34% 
of 
the 
population in Rwimi Town Council have 
access to safe and clean water (MWE, 2018). 
This implies that the bigger percentage (66%) 
of the population have no access to safe and 
clean water. The focus of this study is mainly 
on the potential for defluoridation of water 
from Ntabago Stream to permissible levels 
using crushed fired clay as an adsorbent. 
Crushed fired clay was chosen as it is 
readily available to households in Uganda 
where small scale industries involved in firing 
of clay bricks for construction, firing of 
pottery, and charcoal stove linings are 
common. Other adsorbents have been studied 
for fluoride reduction including bone char, 
ceramics, and oxides (Djousse Kanouo et al., 
2020; Yadav et al., 2018; Habuda-Stanić et 
al., 2014; Madhukar et al., 2014; Loganathan 
et al., 2013), but these may not be available at 
household level.

MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Raw water quality 
Grab samples of stream water were 
collected from three locations along the 
Ntabago Stream (Figure 2) for raw water 
Fluoride concentration analysis. 
 
Defluoridation model filters 
Model 
filters 
were 
prepared 
for 
defluoridation filter test runs as follows: 
Pieces of fired clay bricks were 
crushed and sieved to obtain the particles that 
pass through a 300 µm sieve and are retained 
on a 75 µm sieve. After sieving, the clay was 
washed to eliminate very fine particles (dust 
of less than 75 µm). Clays reportedly have a 
Fluoride adsorption capacity of 84-95 mg/g; 
and over 85% adsorption for clays with high 
Al and Fe content. Heat treatment (firing) 
increases adsorption capacity (Madhukar et 
al., 2014). 
Sand was washed using clean water 
until clean water from it was observed. The 
sand was sun dried for two days, and fine sand 
and coarse sand portions were obtained after 
sieving.  Coarse sand and fine sand of 2 mm 
to 5 mm, and 150 µm to 2 mm, respectively, 
were used. 
The gravel to be used was thoroughly 
washed with clean water to eliminate dust and 
then sun dried, after which gravel of size 6 
mm to 15 mm obtained by sieving. 
The model filter layers were arranged 
with the gravel at the bottom, followed by 
coarse sand, then fine sand, and crushed fired 
clay at the top. The gravel and sand layers had 
a constant thicknesses (5 cm) while the 
crushed fired clay had varying layer thickness 
(2.5 cm, 5 cm, 7.5 cm) in each of the three 
model filters. 
A 3 mgF/L solution comprised of 
distilled water and Sodium Fluoride (NaF) 
was prepared for the model filter test runs. 
After stock preparation, the solution was 
analyzed to confirm the concentration of 
Fluoride ions using SPADNS Colorimetric 
Method (APHA/AWWA/WEF, 1999). 750 
mL of the 3 mgF/L solution was passed 
through the model filter in each test run, and 
the filtrate 
was analysed for Fluoride 
concentration. 
The SPADNS Colorimetric Method 
was used to determine the concentration of 
fluoride in the water before and after 
filtration. This Method is based on the 
reaction between fluoride and a zirconium-dye 

E. WOZEI et al. / Int. J. Biol. Chem. Sci. 15(7): 82-89, 2021 
 
85 
and relies on the fact that when Fluoride 
reacts 
with 
certain 
zirconium 
dyes, 
a 
colourless complex anion and a dye are 
formed. The complex, which is proportional 
to the fluoride concentration, tends to bleach 
the 
dye 
which 
therefore 
becomes 
progressively 
lighter 
as 
the 
Fluoride 
concentration increases. In the case of the 
Fluoride ion reaction with Zr-SPADNS 
(sodium 
2-(parasulphophenylazo-)-1,8-
dihydroxy-3,6-naphthalene disulphonate), the 
resulting coloured complex is measured in a 
spectrophotometer 
at 
570 
nm 
(APHA/AWWA/WEF, 1999; HP, 2000). 
To determine the clay-adsorbed portion 
of Fluoride, the clay was removed from the 
filter and a homogenized sample washed 
using 250 mL of 1 M of hydrochloric acid for 
1-hour in order to extract Fluoride ions in a 
solution. The acid enabled the detaching of 
the Fluoride ions from clay particles into the 
washing solution (Moon et al., 2015). 
After one hour, the suspension was 
filtered using a 0.45 µm micropore filter and 
the filtrate was then analysed for Fluoride 
concentration according to the SPADNS 
Colorimetric Method as described above.  
 
 
Adsorption capacity and effect of adsorbent 
layer thickness 
Fluoride reduction with tests with 
model filters were carried to determined layer 
thickness of the adsorbent and the initial 
Fluoride ion concentration in the solution was 
determined at ambient temperature (~25 °C). 
The Fluoride concentration in the filtrate and 
fired crushed clay from the filter was 
determined using SPADNS Colorimetric 
Method. Three model filter setup experiments 
were used, and three test runs carried out on 
each.  
The effect of the adsorbent layer was 
investigated by varying the crushed fired clay 
layer thicknesses, and spiking the water to be 
filtered with 3 mgF/L. The fired clay 
thickness in the filters was varied from 
between 2 cm to 10 cm (2.5 cm, 5 cm, and 7.5 
cm). The concentrations of Fluoride in the 
filtrate were determined after each test 
(Motora 
and 
Tesema, 
2017). 
The 
concentration of Fluoride retained in the clay 
layer was determined in one of the three test 
runs.

RESULTS  
Defluoridation test runs 
The 2.5 cm and 5 cm crushed fired clay 
layer filters were able to reduce to the 
Fluoride concentration in the filtered water by 
71% and 74% respectively to within the 
optimum range for dental health (0.5-1.5 
mgF/L), which meets the Uganda National 
Standard maximum limit of 1.5 mgF/L 
(Figure 3). Other studies with fired clay show 
similar reduction levels (Mottora and Tesema, 
2017). 
The 7.5 cm clay layer filter reduced the 
Fluoride levels by 95% to below 0.5 mgF/L 
(Figure 3), which is a risk factor for dental 
caries. Reduction in the clay-free control was 
about 10%. Therefore, the 5 cm clay layer 
filter was chosen as a conservative option for 
further study.

DISCUSSION 
With the 7.5 cm clay layer, 95% of the 
Fluoride could be accounted for in the filtered 
water and HCl acid-washed clay, which 
compares favourably with the findings of 
Moon et al., (2015). However, with the 5 cm 
and 7.5 cm clay layers only about 70% of the 
spiked Fluoride was accounted for at the end 
of the test run. It is therefore important to 
carry out more tests to account for the 
remaining 30% in order to understand the 
defluoridation process better, and to determine 
how long the clay layer can remain effective 
before needing to be replaced. 
 
Filtered water quality 
Raw water quality improvement in 
other parameters of interest was therefore 
checked with a 5 cm clay layer test filter 
(Table 2). 
While the 5 cm clay layer model filter 
reduces Fluoride levels to optimum, and 
improves other physicochemical parameters 
(Electrical Conductivity), it produces water 
which needs still improvement in Apparent 
colour, Turbidity and Total Suspended Solids 
levels (Table 2). Further optimization of the 
sand filter layer thickness is needed for overall 
physicochemical and biological water quality 
improvement for household level drinking 
water treatment. An adaptation of the HACCP 
(Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point) 
methodology outlined by Gokpeya et al. 
(2019) for household level clay water filters 
shall form the basis for this assessment.

Conclusion 
Ntabago Stream has between 2-3 mg 
F/L, which is above the National Standard and 
above the optimum range for dental health 
(0.5-1.5 mgF/L). A crushed fired clay layer of 
5 cm thickness in a model filter was adequate 
for reducing Fluoride by 74% to the 
permissible levels. The filter system was also 
effective 
at 
reducing 
water 
Turbidity, 
Electrical Conductivity, Apparent colour and 
Suspended Solids. 
Further studies will be done on 
optimization of the defluoridation model filter 
and process. This would aid in determining 
the contact time for optimum Fluoride 
reduction, 
the 
period 
after 
which 
the 
adsorption sites are fully saturated, potential 
for adsorbent regeneration, maintenance best 
practice for the filter system, and the filter 
layer requirements for achieving overall safe 
drinking water quality at household level.
