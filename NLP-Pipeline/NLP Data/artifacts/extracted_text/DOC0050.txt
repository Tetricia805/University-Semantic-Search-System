QUESTION 1 (25%) 
In this question, you are required to design and evaluate a random forest classifier 
for the task of fish disease classification. The dataset contains features extracted 
from fish images, including texture features such as entropy, contrast, energy, 
homogeneity, correlation, and dissimilarity, color features including average RGB 
pixel values, as well as statistical features such as mean, standard deviation, 
variance, kurtosis, and skewness. The target variable represents ten fish disease 
classes, encoded as integers from 0 to 9. Your task is to train a random forest 
classifier on this dataset and evaluate its performance using standard classification 
metrics. Additionally, you are required to compare the performance of the random 
forest model with that of other classifiers. You are also expected to analyze the 
effect of dimensionality reduction or feature selection on classifier performance, 
model interpretability, and computational efficiency. 
a) Use the training dataset  fish_disease_train.csv (last column = class label) to 
train a random forest classifier. Save the trained model file as model_1.pkl. 
(5 marks) 
b) Load the trained model and test it on dataset fish_disease_test.csv to obtain 
model predictions. (2 marks) 
c) Evaluate the trained model on precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy. (4 
marks) 
d) Apply PCA or any filter feature selection method of your choice and compare 
the model’s performance on test data, before and after dimensionality 
reduction. (4 marks) 
e) Compare the classification results of the random forest on test data with 
decision tree and KNN models, in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F1-
score and receiver operating characteristic - area under the curve (ROC-AUC), 
with visualization. (5 marks) 
f) Discuss the results in detail including class-wise performance and the 
implications of the observed performance trend. (3 marks) 
g) Discuss any model hyperparameter settings, observations, and conclusion. (2 
marks) 
h) Submit the following files:  
1) mode_1.pkl (trained random forest model).

QUESTION 2 (25%) 
In this question, you are required to design and evaluate linear regression models 
for a multi-output regression task using the energy efficiency dataset. Specifically, 
you are required to predict the heating load and cooling load of buildings based on 
eight building features, including relative compactness, surface area, wall area, roof 
area, overall height, orientation, glazing area, and glazing area distribution. You are 
required to evaluate the model performance separately for each target variable, 
using appropriate regression metrics, and compare the linear regression model with 
several other regression techniques. 
a) Use the energy efficiency dataset_train.csv (last two columns = target values) 
to train two linear regression models to predict heating load and cooling load. 
Save the trained models as model1_2.pkl and model2_2.pkl. (4 marks) 
b) Load and test the trained models on the test set, the energy efficiency 
dataset_test.csv. (3 marks) 
c) Visualize two plots of the predicted data against one of the input features 
and include the regression line. (3 marks) 
d) Evaluate the two models on test data using MSE, MAE, RMSE, MAPE, and R² 
score and report the metrics in a results table. (5 marks) 
e) Discuss the results obtained in part (d), highlighting their implications for the 
target variables. Identify which features have the strongest impact on each 
target and describe any notable patterns or insights you observe. (Hint: you 
may use the Pearson correlation coefficient to determine which features most 
strongly influence each target). (4 marks) 
f) Compare the performance of the linear regressors with the following models: 
1) Polynomial regression 
2) Ridge regression 
3) Lasso regression 
4) Support vector regression (SVR) (4 marks) 
g) Discuss the model hyperparameter settings, observations, and conclusion. (2 
marks)

an XGBoost Classifier. Save the model as “model_3.pkl”. (5 marks) 
b) Fine-tune the critical hyperparameters such as learning rate, max_depth, 
n_estimators, and justify your choices. (5 marks)

QUESTION 4 (25%) 
In this question, you are required to apply feature selection using mutual information 
to identify the most relevant predictors for ovarian cancer classification on the 
ovarian cancer dataset.csv. You will then use the selected features to train and

model’s performance. 
a) Apply mutual information to select the top 44 most relevant features, and 
save the resulting dataset as selected_subset.csv. (4 marks) 
b) Train a decision tree classifier on selected_subset.csv dataset. Save the 
model as model1_4.pkl. (4 marks)
