Interval Notation
In the deﬁnitions of Open, closed and Half closed intervals we shall assume that a and b
are real numbers such that a < b.
1.1.1
Open Intervals
An Open Interval, written in interval notation as (a, b), is deﬁned as the set of all numbers
x such that a < x < b : where a < b that is x lies between a and b. This can be represented
in set-builder notation as (a, b) = {x : a < x < b}. The points a and b are themselves not
included.
Example 1.1.1
Express the following open intervals in set-builder notation:
(a) (2, 4)
(b) (−1, 3)
These open intervals can be expressed in set-builder notation as:
(a) (2, 4) = {x : 2 < x < 4}
(b) (−1, 3) = {x : −1 < x < 3}
1.1.2
Closed Intervals
A Closed Interval, written in interval notation as [a, b] is deﬁned as the set of all numbers
x such that a ≤x ≤b. Closed intervals can be represented in set-builder notation as:
[a, b] = (x : a ≤x ≤b) x lies between and includes a and b.
Example 1.1.2
Express the following closed intervals in set builder notation.
(a) [m, n]

CHAPTER 1. FUNCTIONS
(b) [−1, 3]
These closed intervals can be expressed in set builder notation as:
(a) [m, n] = {x : m ≤x ≤n}
(b) [−1, 3] = {x : −1 ≤x ≤3}
1.1.3
Half-open Intervals
There are two types of half open intervals. The left half open interval (a, b] and the right
half open interval [a, b).
The left half open interval is deﬁned as the set of numbers x such that a < x ≤b. This
can be represented in set-builder notation as
(a, b] = {x : a < x ≤b}
where a < b.
The right half open interval is deﬁned as the set of number x such that a ≤x < b, where
a < b. This can be represented in set-builder notation as
[a, b) = {x : a ≤x < b}
Example 1.1.3
Express the following half open intervals in set-builder notation.
(a) (−2, 5]
(b) [−a, a)
The half open intervals above can be expressed in set builder notation as:
(a) (−2, 5] = {x : −2 < x ≤5}
(b) [−a, a) = {x : −a ≤x < a}
1.2
Inﬁnite Intervals
We have four types of inﬁnite intervals.
1.2.1
Open Inﬁnite Intervals
Let a be a real number. The Open Inﬁnite Interval (a, ∞) is the set of numbers x such that
a < x < ∞. This is represented in set - builder notation by (a, ∞) = {x : a < x < ∞}.
This can be displayed on the real line graph by the space between a and inﬁnity but not

CHAPTER 1. FUNCTIONS
including the point a.
Similarly, the open interval (−∞, a), is the set of numbers x such that ∞< x < a. This
is represented in set builder notation by (−∞, a) = {x : −∞< x < a). On the real
line graph, this can be displayed by the space between negative inﬁnity and a, but not
including a.
1.2.2
A closed-inﬁnite interval [a, ∞).
These are the set of numbers x such that a ≤x < ∞. This is expressed in set-builder
notation by (a, ∞) = {x : a ≤x < ∞}. This can be displayed on the real line graph by
the space between a and inﬁnity including the point a.
1.2.3
Inﬁnite Half Open Interval (−∞, a].
This is the set of numbers x such that −∞< x ≤a. This is represented in set-builder
notation by (−∞, a] = (x : −∞< x ≤a). This can be displayed on the real line graph
by the space between negative inﬁnity and a including the point a.
1.2.4
An Inﬁnite-Inﬁnite Interval (−∞, ∞).
This is the set of numbers x such that −∞< x < ∞. This is represented in set builder
notation by (−∞, ∞) = {x : −∞< x < ∞}. This can be displayed on the number line
by all this points between negative inﬁnity and positive inﬁnity. This represents the entire
number line.
Example 1.2.1
Express the following intervals in set - builder notation.
(a) (2, 4)
(b) [2, 4)
(c) (−4, 3]
The above intervals can be expressed in set-builder notation as
(a) (2, 4) = {x : 2 < x < 4}
(b) [2, 4) = {x : 2 ≤x < 4}
(c) (−4, 3] = {x : −4 < x ≤3}
Example 1.2.2
Write the following sets in interval notation:
(a) A
=
{x : −∞< x < 2}
(b) B
=
{x : −1 < x < 4}

CHAPTER 1. FUNCTIONS
(c) C
=
{x : −∞< x ≤3}
(d) D
=
{x : 2 ≤x < ∞}
These sets can be represented in interval notation as follows:-
(a) The set of points do not include 2, but continues to the left of 2 up to negative
inﬁnity, that is (−∞, 2).
(b) The set of points that lies between −1 and −4, that is, (−1, 4).
(c) The set of points that includes 3 and continues to the left of 3 up to negative inﬁnity,
that is, (−∞, 3]
(d) The set of points that includes 2 and continues to the right of 2 up to inﬁnity that
is, [2, ∞).
1.3
Inequalities
The inequality a < b means b −a is positive. The inequality a ≤b means that either
a = b or a < b.
The second inequality is the most misunderstood by beginning students. Many students
are quite happy with 3 < 5 but fear 3 ≤5 or 4 ≥4 may be incorrect. All the three
statements are correct.
Theorem 1.3.1
Let x, y, z and c be real numbers. Then
(i) Exactly one of the following holds: x = y, or x < y or x > y
(ii) If x < y and y < z, then x < z.
(iii) If x < y, then x + c < y + c.
(iv) If x < y and c > 0, then cx < cy.
(v) If x < y and c < 0, then cx > cy.
These inequalities are used to solve inequalities.
Note 1.3.1
Note that multiplying by a negative number reverses the direction of the
inequality. The above properties can be proved. Properties (ii) and () are proved for you.
The other proofs are left as an exercise.
Example 1.3.1
Prove that if a < b and b < c then a < c.
We need to recall that a < b means b −a is positive and b < c means c −b is positive.
The sum of two positive numbers is a positive number. Thus (b −a) + (c −b) = c −a is
positive and therefore a < c.

CHAPTER 1. FUNCTIONS
1.3.1
Solving Inequalities
The process of ﬁnding a solution requires that the inequality be written in a form that
shows the values of the variable that ascertain the truth of the initial inequality. Inequal-
ities may involve sums diﬀerences, products and quotients.
Example 1.3.2
Solve the inequality 2x −9 > −3.
Add +9 to both sides of the inequality.
2x −9 + 9 > −3 + 9; (using property of inequalities: if a < b then a + c < b + c)
gives 2x > 6.
Multiply both sides of the inequality by 1
2 to obtain the coeﬃcient of x as 1 :
1
2 · 2x > 6 · 1
2; (Using property of inequalities: if a > b and c > 0 then ac > bc) from which
x > 3.
Example 1.3.3
Solve the inequality 2(3 + 2x) −4 > 7x.
Distribute 2 to eliminate the brackets 6 + 4x −4 > 7x.
Combine the like terms on the left hand side (LHS) of the inequality. 4x + 2 > 7x
Add −4x + 4x + 2 > 7x −4x; (property of inequalities: if a > b then a + c > b + c) then
2 > 3x.
Multiply by 1
3 to get a coeﬃcient of x = 1. That is, 2 · 1
3 > 1
3 · 3x from which 2
3 > x.
Example 1.3.4
Solve the inequality x2 −7x + 12 > 0. This is a quadratic inequality.
We ﬁnd the need to factor the inequality as (x −4)(x −3) > 0. We want the values of x
that make (x −4)(x −3) positive. Lets look at case 1
- (both numbers are positive). When (x−4) > 0 and (x−3) > 0. If x−4 > 0 then x > 4.
If x −3 > 0 then x > 3.
We choose a solution that satisﬁes both inequalities. We select
x > 4
Case 2: (both numbers negative); (x −4) < 0 and (x −3) < 0.
If x −4 < 0 then x < 4.
If x −3 < 0 then x < 3.
The solution of this case is: All x such that x < 4 and x < 3. Both inequalities will
be satisﬁed by x < 3
From case 1 we have x > 4 and from case 2 we have x < 3. The solution is therefore
x < 3 or x > 4
Example 1.3.5
Solve
4
x + 1 < 2.
DDW, GIM, JMK, Calculus I: Lecture Notes

CHAPTER 1. FUNCTIONS
Multiply both sides of the inequality by (x + 1) to eliminate the fraction. (x + 1) could
be a positive (x + 1) > 0, or negative that is, (x + 1) < 0 number. We therefore consider
both cases.
Case 1: (x + 1) > 0 that is, x > −1.
Multiply both sides of
1
x+1 < 2 by a positive number (x −1) > 0, gives
4
<
2(x + 1)
4
<
2x + 2
2
<
2x
1
<
x
The solution must satisfy both x > −1 and 1 < x.
The intersection gives the solution as x > 1.
Case 2: (x + 1) < 0 that is, x < −1.
Multiplying both sides of
4
x+1 < 2 by a negative number (x + 1) < 0 gives
4
>
2(x + 1)
4
>
2x + 2
2
>
2x
1
>
x
The solution must satisfy both x < −1 and 1 > x.
The solution is x < −1. From the case 1 we have the solution x > 1 and in case 2 we have
the solution x < −1. The whole solution is therefore x > 1 or x < −1.
Example 1.3.6
Prove that if a < b then a + c < b + c.
a < b means b −a is positive. But b −a may be rewritten as (b + c) −(a + c). This is a
positive number. Hence a + c < b + c.
Example 1.3.7
Solve 3 + x < 8.
Add −3 to both sides of the inequality to obtain x < 5. Therefore the solution set is
{x ∈R : x < 5} which is the same as (−1, 5).
Example 1.3.8
Solve x2 + x + 1 > 7.
Add −7 to both sides to obtain
x2 + x −6
>
0
i.e. (x + 3)(x −2)
>
0
But when is a product of two real numbers positive?

CHAPTER 1. FUNCTIONS
(i) (x + 3) > 0 and (x −2) > 0. Then x > −3 and x > 2, implying that x > 2, OR
(ii) (x + 3) < 0 and (x −2) < 0. Then x < −3 and x < 2, implying x < −3.
Therefore the solution set of the inequality is the set (−∞, −3) ∪(2, ∞).
Example 1.3.9
Solve the problem
x2 −5x + 4
x + 2
< 0
or
(x −1)(x −4)
x + 2
< 0
In this case there are several ways in which this inequality could be less than or equal to
zero. (that is, Negative). These are:
(i) (x −1) is positive; (x −4) is positive while x + 2 is negative.
(ii) (x −1) is positive; (x −4) is negative while (x + 2) is positive.
(iii) (x −1) is negative; (x + 2) is positive while (x + 2) is positive.
(iv) (x −1) is negative; (x −4) is negative while (x + 2) is negative.
The solution of this type of inequality involves considering each of the cases (i) to (iv)
above. The ﬁnal solution is obtained by combining the results from the cases, that have
solutions.
Example 1.3.10
Solve
(x −1)(x −4)
x + 2
< 0
Consider Case 1: If
(positive) (positive)
(negative)
Then: (x −1) > 0 [that is, x > 1] and (x −4) > 0 [that is, x > 4] and (x + 2) < 0 [that
is, x < −2] A number can not simultaneously be greater than 4 and less than −2. There
is therefore no solution in this case.
Case 2:
(positive) (negative)
(positive)
DDW, GIM, JMK, Calculus I: Lecture Notes

CHAPTER 1. FUNCTIONS
Then
(x −1) > 0
that is, x > 1 and
(x −4) < 0
that is, x < 4 and
(x + 4) > 0
that is, x > −2
The solution is 1 < x < 4.
Case 3: If
(negative) (positive)
(Positive)
.
Then
(x −1) < 0
that is, x < 1 and
(x −4) > 0
that is, x > 4 and
(x + 2) > 0
that is, x > −2
The solution must satisfy all these inequalities x < 1; x > 4; x > −2. A number cannot
be less than one and at the same time greater than 4. There is no solution in this case.
Case 4: If
(negative) (negative)
(negative)
.
Then
(x −1) < 0
that is, x < 1,
and
(x −4) < 0
that is, x < 4,
and
(x + 2) < 0
that is, x < −2
The solution that satisﬁes all inequalities is x < −2.
The solution of the problem is obtained by combining the cases that produced solutions
in this case, cases 2 and 4. Therefore the solution is x < −2 or 1 < x < 4.
Example 1.3.11
Another group of inequalities are of the form (x3 + 2x2 −3x) > 0 or
x(x + 3)(x −1) > 0. In this case there are several ways of producing a positive product.
These could be:
1. x is positive; (x + 3) is positive and (x −1) positive
2. x is positive; (x + 3) is negative and (x −1) is negative

CHAPTER 1. FUNCTIONS
3. x is negative; (x + 3) is negative and (x −1) is positive.
4. x is negative (x + 3) is positive and (x −1) is negative.
Example 1.3.12
Solve
x(x + 3)(x −1) > 0
Consider case 1: If (positive) (positive) (positive)
Then x > 0 and (x + 3) > 0 and (x −1) > 0. Hence: x > 0 and x > −3 and x > 1. This
yields the solution x > 1.
Case 2: If (positive) (negative) (negative)
Then x > 0 and (x + 3) < 0 and (x −1) < 0 Hence: x > 0 and x < −3 and x < 1.
These inequalities have no solution.
Case 3: If (negative) (negative) (positive)
Then x < 0 and (x + 3) < 0 and (x −1) > 0 Hence: x < 0 and x > −3 and x > 1
These inequalities have no solution.
Case 4: If (negative) (positive) negative)
Then x < 0 and (x + 3) > 0 and (x −1) < 0 Hence: x < 0 and x > −3 and x < 1. The
solution is 0 < x < 1 Thus combining the solutions in cases 1 and 2. The solution to the
problem is x > 1 or −3 < x < 0.
Example 1.3.13
Solve the inequality
(x −1)(x + 2)
(x −3)
< 0
Example 1.3.14
Solve the inequality
(x + 2)(x −3) > 0
To be positive, both terms have to be positive,
(x + 2)
> 0
⇒x > −2 and
(x −3)
> 0
⇒x > 3
x > 3 ≡(3, ∞)
”Or”, both terms are negative
(x + 2)
< 0
⇒x < −2 and
(x −3)
< 0
⇒x < 3
x < −2 ≡(−∞, −2)

Absolute values in calculus
The absolute value of a real number x is denoted by |x| and is given by
|x| =

x ,
x ≥0
−x ,
x < 0
The absolute value of a real number x is a measure of how far the real number x is from
0, the origin of the number line. For this reason it is always a positive quantity and
sometimes it is referred to as the magnitude of the number. Alternatively, the absolute
value of x may be deﬁned as |x| =
√
x2. (Note that √x stands for the positive square
root of x). The distance between two real numbers a and b is the number |a−b| = |b−a|.
Example 1.4.1
Simplify the norm (abolute value) |x −5|
|x −5| =



(x −5) ,
x ≥5
−(x −5) ,
x < 5
Example 1.4.2
Solve the inequality |x + 3| = 4. We know that
|x + 3| =



(x + 3) ,
x ≥−3
−(x + 3) ,
x < −3
x + 3 = 4, ⇒x = 1 or −(x + 3) = 4, ⇒x = −7
Theorem 1.4.1 The inequality |x| ≤a is equivalent to the double inequality −a ≤x ≤a.
The inequality |y| ≥b holds for y ≤−b or y ≥b.

Theorem 1.4.2
For any real numbers x and y,
(a) |x| ≥0,
(b) |xy| = |x||y|,

Find the absolute-value inequality statement that corresponds to the

I want to adjust the inequality so it relates to −2.5 and 2.5, instead of relating to 19 and

x < 19 or x > 24
x −21.5 < 19 −21.5 or x −21.5 > 24 −21.5
x −21.5 < −2.5 or x −21.5 > 2.5
Since the last line above is the ”greater than” format, the absolute-value inequality will

Functions
Deﬁnition 1.5.1
A function is a set of ordered pairs of elements such that not two or-
dered pairs of a set have the same ﬁrst element.
Functions can be considered as mappings. A function is a special kind of relation in which
all ordered pairs have unique ﬁrst elements. Every element of the ﬁrst set is assigned to
an element of the second set. Usually subsets of the set of real numbers R are considered.
A function involves two sets and a rule of correspondence between them. The rule of
correspondence speciﬁes how to pair the elements of the one set with those in the other.
A function is a relation in which for each member of the ﬁrst set there is a single corre-
sponding member of the second set. A rule exists between two quantities.
A function has to satisfy The Vertical Line Test.
1.5.1
Domain and Range as a set of Ordered Pairs.
The domain (D) is the set of all values that the ﬁrst elements, in the ordered pair can
take. The Range (R) is the set of all values that the second elements, in the ordered pair,
can take.
Example 1.5.1
The following table deﬁnes a function.

(a) List the ordered pairs of the function
(b) State the domain of the function
(c) State the range of the function
(a) The ordered pairs of the function are: (−3, −2); (5, 8); (6, 9)and(7, 5).
(b) The Domain are the set of the ﬁrst elements of the ordered pairs. D = {−3, 5, 6, 7}
(c) The Range are the set of the second elements of the ordered pairs. R = {−2, 8, 9, 5}
Example 1.5.2 State the domain and range of the function f = {(−2, 4)(−1, 4)(0, 4)(2, 4)}
The Domain D = {−2, −1, 0, 2}, are the ﬁrst elements in the ordered pairs. The Range
R = {4}, is the second element in the ordered pairs.

CHAPTER 1. FUNCTIONS
Example 1.5.3
A mapping deﬁned by
{(−1, 2),
(4, 6),
(5, 0),
(4, 3)}
is not a function, since the ﬁrst element 4 appears twice (more than once).
Note 1.5.1
A function can be given in the form of ordered pairs such as
{(−1, 1),
(4, 11),
(5, 13),
(1, 5)}
or by a formula i.e f(x) = 2x + 3
Deﬁnition 1.5.2 The domain of a function is the set of ”input” or argument values for
which the function is deﬁned. That is, the function provides an ”output” or ”value” for
each member of the domain.
Deﬁnition 1.5.3
The range is the codomain or the image of the function
Example 1.5.4
Determine the domain and range of the given function:
y = (x2 + x −2)
(x2 −x −2)
The domain is all the values that x is allowed to take on. The only problem I have with
this function is that I need to be careful not to divide by zero. So the only values that x
can not take on are those which would cause division by zero. So I’ll set the denominator
equal to zero and solve; my domain will be everything else.
x2 −x −2
=
0
(x −2)(x + 1)
=
0
x = 2 or x = −1
Then the domain is ”all x not equal to −1 or 2”.
Since the graph will eventually cover all possible values of y, then the range is ”all real
numbers”.
Example 1.5.5
Determine the domain and range of the given function:
y = −
√
−2x + 3
The domain is all values that x can take on. The only problem I have with this function
is that I cannot have a negative inside the square root. So I’ll set the insides greater-
than-or-equal-to zero, and solve. The result will be my domain:
−2x + 3

0

2 = 1.5
DDW, GIM, JMK, Calculus I: Lecture Notes

CHAPTER 1. FUNCTIONS
Then the domain is ”all x ≤3
2”.
The range requires a graph. I need to be careful when graphing radicals:The range is
”y < 0”.
Example 1.5.6
Determine the domain and range of the given function:
y = −x4 + 4
This is just a garden-variety polynomial. There are no denominators (so no division-by-
zero problems) and no radicals (so no square-root-of-a-negative problems). There are no
problems with a polynomial. There are no values that I can’t plug in for x. When I have
a polynomial, the answer is always that the domain is ”all x”.
The range will vary from polynomial to polynomial, and they probably won’t even ask,
but when they do, I look at the picture: The graph goes only as high as y = 4, but it will
go as high as I like. Then: The range is ”all y ≥4”.
Example 1.5.7
Find the domain of function f deﬁned by
f(x) =
1
(x −1)
The domain x is such that x ̸= 1, that is
x ∈(−∞, 1) ∪(1, +∞)
Example 1.5.8
what is the domain of the function
f(x) =
√
x2 −1 ?
Well, what could go wrong here? No division is indicated at all, so there is no risk of
dividing by 0. But we are taking a square root, so we must insist that x2 −1 ≥0 to avoid
having complex numbers come up. That is, a preliminary description of the ‘domain’ of
this function is that it is the set of real numbers x so that x2 −1 ≥0.
But we can be clearer than this: we know how to solve such inequalities. Often it’s
simplest to see what to exclude rather than include: here we want to exclude from the
domain any numbers x so that x2 −1 < 0 from the domain.
We recognize that we can factor
x2 −1 = (x −1)(x + 1) = (x −1) (x −(−1))
This is negative exactly on the interval (−1, 1), so this is the interval we must prohibit in
order to have just the domain of the function. That is, the domain is the union of two
intervals:
(−∞, −1] ∪[1, +∞)

x(x −1)(x + 1)
Example 1.5.9
Compute the domain of the fuction
|x −3.2| + |x −5.2| = 2
Note 1.5.2
The domain is where the function lives (are the x values), and the range is
what the function can be (is the f(x)). To get domain, make sure the denominator is not
equal to zero, and cannot have a square root of a negative number.
Example 1.5.10
Find the domain and range of the following function
(i)
f(x) =
3
x2 −1
f(x) =

Df = R −{−1, 1}, the domain are all possible solutions, which is all numbers, i.e
Rf = R
(ii) f(x) = √x −4, We know that we want only positive entries in the square root sign,
that is, x −4 ≥0, meaning the domain is only values of x, such that x ≥4

CHAPTER 1. FUNCTIONS
1.5.2
Function Notation
The notation f(x) represents the second element in the ordered pair that has x as its ﬁrst
element. This ordered pair can be represented as (x, f(x)). We read f(x) as ”f of x” or
”f at x” since f(x) gives the value of f at x. This relation can also be represented as:
x ⇒f(x)
Often we replace f(x) by y, also called the dependent variable, and write y = f(x). With
this notation, x is called the independent variable. For example f(x) = 3x + 2 may be
written as y = 3x + 2.
1.5.3
Evaluation of Functions
The evaluation of a function is illustrated by examples.
A rule describing a function
can be represented by an equation or formula, a table or a graph, which are recorded as
ordered pairs. The evaluation of a function is to ﬁnd a number that is paired with a given
number.
Example 1.5.14 To evaluate the function f(x) = 3x + 2 at x = 2, we need the number
f(2). Since f(x) = 3x + 2, replace x by 2 in the expression for the function and simplify.
Thus f(2) = 3 × 2 + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8. Therefore the ordered pair is (2, 8). We write f(2) = 8
or 2 →8. This is the y value in the expression by y = 3x + 2 when x = 2.
Example 1.5.15
Let f(x) = x2 + 6x + 2 Find the value of
(a) f(0)
(b) f(−2)
(c) f(1)
(d) f(x + 1)
(e) f(n −2)
(a) f(0) = 02 + 6(0) + 2 = 2. Thus 0 →2 or as an ordered pair, (0, 2).
(b) f(−2) = (−2)2 + 6(−2) + 2 = −6. Thus −2 →−6 or as an ordered pair, (−2, −6).
(c) f(1) = 12 + 6(1) + 2 = 9. Thus 1 →9 or as an ordered pair, (1, 9).
(d)
f(x + 1)
=
(x + 1)2 + 6(x + 1) + 2
=
(x2 + 2x + 1 + 6x + 6 + 2)
=
x2 + 8x + 9.
Thus (x + 1) →x2 + 8x + 9 or as an ordered pair, ((x + 1), (x2 + 8x + 9)).

f(x + h) −f(x)

Therefore,
f(x + h) −f(x)

Types of functions
1.6.1
Equal Functions
Let f1(x) and f2(x) be functions that are deﬁned on the same domain, D. If for each
element x of D, f1(x) = f2(x), then the two functions are equal and we write f1(x) = f2(x).
Two functions f1(x) and f2(x) are equal if and only if f1(x) and f2(x) have the same
domains and f1(x) = f2(x) for all x in this common domain.
Example 1.6.1
Prove that the functions:
(a) f1(x) = 2x + 1 and f2(x) = 4x
2 + 1 are equal, where the domain for both functions
is the set of real numbers R.
(b) f1(x) = sin x and f2(x) = cos
  π
2 −x

are equal, where the domain of for both
functions is the set of real numbers.
(a) Let a be a real number. Then f1(a) = 2a+1 = 4
2a+1 = 4a
2 +1 = f2(a). Since a was
arbitrary, f1(x) = f2(x)for all real numbers. The two functions are therefore equal.
(b) Let a be a real number. Then f2(a) = cos

1.6.2
Identity Function
A function f that associates each member of the domain with itself is called the identity
function. The identity function is deﬁned by the equation f : x →x or f(x) = x. The
domain and the range of the identity function is the set of real numbers.
The identity function is a special kind of one-to-one and onto function.
1.6.3
Constant Function
A function f that associates each real number in a set A the same ﬁxed number k in
the set B is called a constant function. The constant function is deﬁned by the formula
f : x →k :
f(x) = k(a single ﬁxed number).

CHAPTER 1. FUNCTIONS
1.6.4
One-to-One Function
If f is a function of A into B is said to be one-to-one (1 −1) if no two elements of A
correspond to the same element in B. Each element of the domain has a diﬀerent image
in the Range.
A function is one-to-one if and only if each element in the domain is mapped into a unique
element of the co-domain (range).
A one to one function is a function in which every element in the range of the function
corresponds with one and only one element in the domain.
For a 1 −1 function, If x1 ̸= x2 then f(x1) ̸= f(x2)
Example 1.6.2
If f(a) = f(b) implies that a = b, then f is 1 −1, show whether or not
g(x) = 3x −2 is one-on-one?
see if g(a)
=
g(b) implies a = b
3a −2
=
3b −2
3a
=
3b
a
=
b
Thus g is 1 −1.
Example 1.6.3
The function f : R →R deﬁned by f(x) = 2x + 1 is injective.
Example 1.6.4
The function g : R →R deﬁned by g(x) = x2 is not injective, because
(for example) g(1) = 1 = g(−1). However, if g is redeﬁned so that its domain is the
non-negative real numbers [0, +∞), then g is injective.
A one-to-one function is one in which each x has only one y and each y has at most one
x to form ordered pairs.
Example 1.6.5
Let the function f : R →R be deﬁned by the equation f(x) = 3x + 2
where R is the set of real numbers. Each real number will be mapped onto a unique image
by the function f(x) = 3x + 2. Hence f is a one-to-one function.
Example 1.6.6
Let the function f : R →R be deﬁned by the formula f(x) = 3x2 + 2
Verify whether or not f is a one-to-one function.
The negative values of R are mapped onto the same elements as the corresponding positive
elements. For example, when x = −2, f(−2) = 14 and f(2) = 14. The images of two real
numbers −2 and 2 are the same number equal to 14. It follows that f is NOT a one-to-one
function.
Deﬁnition 1.6.1
A one to one function is also called an injective function.

Deﬁnition 1.6.2 The Horizontal Line Test : If a horizontal line only intersects with the
graph of a function once, then this function is one-to-one. If a horizontal line intersects
the graph of the function more than once, then this function is not one to one.

Many-to-One Function
If f is a relation of A into B. If more than one element of A is mapped into the same
element of B then f is a many-to-one function.
1.6.6
Onto-Functions
If f is a function of A into B. Sometimes the range, f(A) does not exhaust all the elements
of the set B called the co-domain. The range is therefore a subset of the co-domain. If
each member of the co-domain is an image of at least one member of A then f is a function
of A ONTO B and is therefore an onto function.
Deﬁnition 1.6.3
A function f from A to B is called onto if for all b in B there is an a
in A such that f(a) = b. All elements in B are used. Such functions are referred to as
surjective.

Figure 1.4: An ”onto” and ”Not onto” functions
A function is said to be onto if all in range is an image (is a result of the transformation
- mapping)
Example 1.6.10 Is f(x) = 3x −4 onto where f : R →R?
The function is onto; as you progress along 
the line, every possible y-value is used.

used. Since possible y-values belong to the set of ALL 
Real numbers, not ALL possible y-values are used.

1.6.7
Bijective Function
A Bijective, is a function that is both 1 −1 and onto.
Example 1.6.12
Example (1.6.10) is 1 −1 and Surjective, thus Bijective.
Example 1.6.13
Example (1.6.11) is not 1 −1 and not ”onto”
Deﬁnition 1.6.4
Bijections are functions that are both injective and surjective.
Example 1.6.14
Let f : [0, ∞) →[0, ∞) be deﬁned by f(x) = √x. This function is an
injection and a surjection and so it is also a bijection.
Example 1.6.15
Describe the four functions below as injective, onto or bijective.
Figure 1.7: Mixed functions
(i) the function is neither injective nor surjective.
(ii) is a surjection, but not an injection
DDW, GIM, JMK, Calculus I: Lecture Notes
29

CHAPTER 1. FUNCTIONS
(iii) is an injection, but not a surjection.
(iv) is both a surjection and an injection, and therefore a bijection.
Example 1.6.16 Prove that the function f : N →N be deﬁned by f(n) = n2 is injective.
Proof: Let a, b ∈N be such that f(a) = f(b). This implies a2 = b2 by the deﬁnition of f.
Thus a = b or a = −b. Since the domain of f is the set of natural numbers (positive
integers), both a and b must be non-negative. Thus a = b. This shows
∀a, ∀b, [f(a) = f(b) ⇒a = b]
which shows f is injective.
Example 1.6.17 Prove that the function g : N →N, deﬁned by g(n) = n
3, is surjective.
Proof: Let n ∈N. Notice that g(3n) = 3n
3 = n.
Since 3n ∈N, this shows n is in the range of g. Hence g is surjective.
Example 1.6.18
Prove that the function g : N →N, deﬁned by g(n) = 0, is not
injective.
Proof: The numbers 1 and 2 are in the domain of g and are not equal, but g(1) = g(2) = 0.
Thus g is not injective.
Example 1.6.19
Prove that the function f : N →N be deﬁned by f(n) = n2, is not
surjective.
Proof: The number 3 is an element of the codomain, N. However, 3 is not the square of
any integer. Therefore, there is no element of the domain that maps to the number 3, so
f is not surjective.
1.6.8
Even Functions
A function f is called an even function if it maps the negative of x in the domain to the
same image as x. This can be deﬁned as f(−x) = f(x) for all x in the domain.
Example 1.6.20
The function f(x) = x2 + 2 is even since
f(−x) = (−x)2 + 2 = x2 + 2 = f(x)
DDW, GIM, JMK, Calculus I: Lecture Notes
30

CHAPTER 1. FUNCTIONS
1.6.9
Odd Functions
A function f is called an Odd function if it maps the negative of x to the negative of f(x)
for all x in the domain. That is, if f(−x) = −f(x).
Example 1.6.21
The function f(x) = x3 + x is odd since
f(−x) = (−x)3 + (−x) = −x3 −x = −(x3 + x) = −f(x)
Example 1.6.22 Determine whether the function f(x) = x2 −x is even, odd or neither.
f(−x)
=
(−x)2 −(−x)
=
x2 + x
f(−x) is neither equal to f(x) nor equal to −f(x). Therefore the function f is neither
even nor odd.
Example 1.6.23
The function f(x) = x2 is even, g(x) = x3 is an odd function but
h(x) = x + 1 is neither odd nor even.
1.6.10
Inverse of functions
An inverse of a relation that satisﬁes the deﬁnition of a function is called an inverse
function.
The inverse of a function f is denoted by f −1.
Note 1.6.1
An inverse exists if the function is one-to-one and onto.
Let A and B be any sets and f be a function from A into B, that is, f : A →B. The
inverse function maps elements in B into those in A, that is f −1 : B →A. The domain
of the function f is the range of f −1 and the range of f is the domain of f −1.
Deﬁnition 1.6.5
Suppose f : A →B is a bijection. Then the inverse of f, denoted
f −1 : B →A
is the function deﬁned by the rule
f −1(y) = x if and only if f(x) = y
Finding the Inverse Function
If we are given a function that is one-to-one and onto then we can ﬁnd its inverse. If a
relation is deﬁned by an equation, the inverse can be obtained by
1. interchanging x and y in the equation,
DDW, GIM, JMK, Calculus I: Lecture Notes
31

CHAPTER 1. FUNCTIONS
2. solving the new equation with y as the subject of the equation, that is, y = ... and
3. replacing y by f −1(x).
This gives the inverse function.
Example 1.6.24
Find the inverse of the function f(x) = 2x + 4 if it exists.
This function is surely one-to-one and onto (verify this). It is therefore possible to ﬁnd
its inverse. The function f(x) = 2x + 4 can be written as y = 2x + 4. Now, interchanging
x and y gives x = 2y +4. Making y the subject of the equation gives y = x−4
2 . The inverse

f(x) =
x
x −2
Then the function
f −1(x) =
2x
x −1
is the inverse of f. Show.

f(x) = x −1
x + 2
Exercise 1.7 Find the inverse of the function f : R →(−∞, 1) deﬁned by f(x) = 1−ex.
Theorem 1.6.2
Let A and B are any sets and the function f : A →B be one-to-one
and onto (the inverse function exists) (f −1of) : A →A is the identity function on A
similarly the composite function (fof −1) : B →B is the identity function on B.
Proof: Let a ∈A. Then (f −1of)(a) = f −1(f(a)) = f −1(b) for some b ∈B. Now we
have f(a) = b which implies that f −1(b) = a. It follows that (f −1of)(a) = f −1(f(a)) =
f −1(b) = a and therefore that (f −1of) : A →A is the identity function on A.
Similarly if b ∈B, then (fof −1)(b) = f(f −1(b)) = f(a) for some a satisfying f −1(b) = a
and f(a) = b. Hence (fof −1)(b) = f(f −1(b)) = f(a) = b. Therefore (fof −1) is the identity
function on B.

If a function is a bijection, then its inverse is also a bijection.

The function f(x) = x2 does not have an inverse, since it is not a

Operations of functions
(1) Sums of functions
Given two functions g(x), f(x), their sum denoted by (f + g)(x) is deﬁned as (f +
g) (x) = f(x) + g(x)
or (g + f) (x) = g(x) + f(x)
Example 1.6.27
Given that f(x) = 3x and g(x) = x2, then
(f + g) (x) = f(x) + g(x) = 3x + x2
or (g + f) (x) = g(x) + f(x) = x2 + 3x
Example 1.6.28
Given that f(x) = 2x and g(x) = 3x, then
(f + g) (x) = f(x) + g(x) = 2x + 3x = 5x
or (g + f) (x) = g(x) + f(x) = 3x + 2x = 5x
Example 1.6.29
Given f1 = 5x + 2 and f2 = x2 + 4. Find (f1 + f2)(x).
(f1 + f2)(x)
=
f1(x) + f2(x)
=
5x + 2 + x2 + 4
=
x2 + 5x + 6
(2) Diﬀerence of functions
Given two functions g(x), f(x), their diﬀerence denoted by (f −g)(x) is deﬁned as
(f −g) (x) = f(x) −g(x)
or (g −f) (x) = g(x) −f(x)
Example 1.6.30
Given that f(x) = 3x and g(x) = x2, then
(f −g) (x) = f(x) −g(x) = 3x −x2
or (g −f) (x) = g(x) −f(x) = x2 −3x
Example 1.6.31
Given that f(x) = 2x and g(x) = 3x, then
(f −g) (x) = f(x) −g(x) = 2x −3x = −x
or (g −f) (x) = g(x) −f(x) = 3x −2x = x

(3) Product of functions
Given two functions g(x), f(x), their product denoted by (f.g)(x) or simplfy (fg)(x)
is deﬁned as (f.g) (x) = f(x).g(x)
or (g.f) (x) = g(x).f(x)
Example 1.6.33
Given that f(x) = 3x and g(x) = x2, then
(f.g) (x) = f(x).g(x) = 3x.x2 = 3x3
or (g.f) (x) = g(x).f(x) = x2.3x = 3x3
Example 1.6.34
Given that f(x) = 2x and g(x) = 3x, then
(f.g) (x) = f(x).g(x) = 2x.3x = 6x2
or (g.f) (x) = g(x).f(x) = 3x.2x = 6x2
Example 1.6.35
If f1(x) = x2 −4 and f2(x) = x −2 ﬁnd (f1 · f2)(x).
(f1 · f2)(x)
=
f1(x) · f2(x)
=
(x2 −4)(x −2)
=
x3 −2x2 −4x + 8
(4) Quotient of functions
Given two functions g(x), f(x), their quotient denoted by (f/g)(x) is deﬁned as
(f/g) (x) = f(x)/g(x)
or (g/f) (x) = g(x)/f(x)
Example 1.6.36
Given that f(x) = 3x and g(x) = x2, then
(f/g) (x) = f(x)/g(x) = 3x/x2 = 3/x
or (g.f) (x) = g(x)/f(x) = x2/3x = x/3
Example 1.6.37
Given that f(x) = 2x and g(x) = 3x, then
(f/g) (x) = f(x)/g(x) = 2x/3x = 2/3
or (g/f) (x) = g(x)/f(x) = 3x/2x = 3/2 The quotient is sometimes referred to as a
rational function.

CHAPTER 1. FUNCTIONS
Example 1.6.38
If f1(x) = x2 −4 and f2(x) = x −2. Evaluate (f1/f2)(x).
(f1/f2)(x)
=
f1(x) ÷ f2(x)
=
(x2 −4) ÷ (x −2)
=
(x + 2)(x −2)
(x −2)
=
(x + 2)
The domain of this function in the set of real numbers excludes x = 2 since for
x = 2 we have f2(x) = 0.
(5) Composite functions
Given two functions g(x), f(x), their composite function denoted by fog(x) is de-
ﬁned as fog (x) = f (g(x))
or gof (x) = g (f(x))
Example 1.6.39
Given that f(x) = 3x and g(x) = x2, then
fog (x) = f (x2) = 3x2
gof (x) = g (3x) = (3x)2 = 9x2
Example 1.6.40
Given that h(x) = 2x and g(x) = 5x, then
hog (x) = h (5x) = 2(5x) = 10x
goh (x) = g (2x) = 5(2x) = 10x
Example 1.6.41 Let f1(x) = x2+3x+2 and f2(x) = x+3. Compute and simplify
(if possible) (f2of1)(x) and (f1of2)(x).
(f2of1)(x)
=
f2(f1(x))
=
f2(x2 + 3x + 2)
=
(x2 + 3x + 2) + 3
=
x2 + 3x + 5
To compute (f1of2)(x), substitute f2 into f1
(f1of2)(x) = f1(f2(x))
=
f1(x + 3)
=
(x + 3)2 + 3(x + 3) + 2
=
x2 + 6x + 9 + 3x + 9 + 2
=
x2 + 9x + 20
Note that in this case commutativity does not hold that is,
(f2of1)(x) ̸= (f1of2)(x).

Theorem 1.6.4
The composition of two injective functions is injective.
Domain of Composite, Diﬀerence, addition and product of func-
tions
Deﬁnition 1.6.6
If we denote a domain as D, we deﬁne the domains
(i) Df+g = Df−g = Dfg = Df ∩Dg
(ii) Df/g = (Df ∩Dg) \{x : g(x) = 0}
(iii) Dfog = {x ∈Dg : g(x) ∈Df}. Since g(x) is a domain of fog, then domain of g is
domain of the composite, where g(x) is in domain of fog.
Note 1.6.2
Finding the domain of a composite function consists of two steps:
Step 1. Find the domain of the ”inside” (input) function. If there are any restrictions on
the domain, keep them.
Step 2. Construct the composite function.
Find the domain of this new function.
If
there are restrictions on this domain, add them to the restrictions from Step 1.
If there is an overlap, use the more restrictive domain (or the intersection of the
domains). The composite may also result in a domain unrelated to the domains
of the original functions.

(i) Df = [−3, ∞)
(ii) Dg = [−4, 4]

Given the functions f(x) = √x and g(x) = x2 + 5

Dfog = [0, ∞)

Deﬁnition 1.6.7
A function is said to be piecewise deﬁned if its deﬁned by applying
diﬀerent formulas to the diﬀerent parts of its domain.

t ≤−3

Deﬁnition 1.6.8
A function f is said to be a power function if it has the form
f(x) = xn, for some n ∈N.
Deﬁnition 1.6.9
A function f is said to be a quadratic function if it can be written
in the form
f(x) = Ax2 + Bx + C
Deﬁnition 1.6.10
A polynomial function f is one that can be written in the form
f(x) = anxn + an−1xn−1 + · · · + a1x + a0
where a0, a1, . . . , an are constants and n is a positive integer.
This integer n is then called the degree of the polynomial, provided an ̸= 0.
Deﬁnition 1.6.11
A function g is said to be a rational function if it is of the type
g(x) = f(x)
h(x)

Deﬁnition 1.6.12
A function f is said to be periodic, with period T, if
f(x + nT) = f(x)
for all x in its domain and for n = 1, 2, . . .
That means the function repeats itself as the rate of T intervals of x. For example the
function f(x) = sin x is periodic with period 2π since sin(x + 2nπ) = sin x for all n = 1,
2, . .
Deﬁnition 1.6.13
A function f is said to be strictly monotonic increasing in the
interval (a, b) if, for all pairs of numbers x1, x2 in (a, b),
f(x1) < f(x2) when x1 < x2
Deﬁnition 1.6.14
The ﬂoor function or greatest integer function is the function
deﬁned as follows: for a real number x, the ﬂoor of x, denoted ⌊x⌋, is the greatest integer
less than or equal to x.
The ﬂoor of x is sometimes referred to as the integer part or integral value of x. (Is the
integer just below - on the left)
Example 1.6.55
(i) ⌊5⌋= 5
(ii) ⌊1.78⌋= 1
(iii) ⌊0⌋= 0
(iv) ⌊−1.6⌋= −2
(v) ⌊−3.5⌋= −4
(vi) ⌊−99.9⌋= −100
Example 1.6.56
⌊1.7⌋= 1, ⌊π⌋= 3 and ⌊−3.2⌋= −4
The ﬂoor of x satisﬁes the following inequality.
⌊x⌋≤x < ⌊x⌋+ 1
Deﬁnition 1.6.15 The ceiling function or smallest integer function is the function
deﬁned as follows: for a real number x, the ceiling of x, denoted ⌈x⌉, is the smallest integer
not less than x. (The integer just above - on the right)
Example 1.6.57
(i) ⌈5⌉= 5
(ii) ⌈1.78⌉= 2
(iii) ⌈0⌉= 0
(iv) ⌈−1.6⌉= −1
(v) ⌈−3.5⌉= −3

CHAPTER 1. FUNCTIONS
Example 1.6.58
⌈1.7⌉= 2, ⌈π⌉= 4 and ⌈−3.2⌉= −3
The ceiling of x satisﬁes the following inequality.
x ≤⌈x⌉< x + 1
Deﬁnition 1.6.16
The sign function is the function, denoted sgn, deﬁned as
sgn(x) =



−1,
x < 0
0,
x = 0
1,
x > 0
Note that for any real number x = sgn(x)|x|. So if x ̸= 0,
sgn(x) = x
|x|
The sgn function is usually referred to as the signum function.

each modulus

⇒
f1(x) = (x −3)

f3(x) = −(x −3)
+(x −1) : x < 3, x ≥1
⇒
f3(x) = −(x −3)
(x −1) : x ∈[1, 3)
f4(x) = −(x −3)
−(x −1) : x < 3, x < 1
