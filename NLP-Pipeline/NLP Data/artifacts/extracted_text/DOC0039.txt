CRISP-DM Method
CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) 
is a widely used methodology that provides a framework for 
conducting data mining projects. It outlines a series of phases 
that guide the process from business understanding to 
deployment.

Data exploration and visualisation 
In data mining, exploration helps an analyst understand the 
data, identify patterns, and communicate findings effectively.
Handles various aspects such as;
Summary Statistics: Calculate measures like mean, median, mode, standard deviation, 
and percentiles to get a basic understanding of the data distribution.
Data Profiling: Examine data types, missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
Univariate Analysis: Analyze individual variables to understand their distributions and 
characteristics.

Multivariate Analysis: Explore relationships among multiple variables.
Data Storytelling: Use visualizations to create compelling narratives and 
communicate insights effectively.

Association rule mining
●This technique discovers interesting relationships between 
items in a large dataset. These relationships, typically 
represented as rules, can be used to make predictions or 
recommendations.
●The  technique uses unsupervised machine learning 
algorithms to find the hidden rules (associations) in data
●Association rule mining assigns key statistical parameters that 
are different from correlations (i.e. Support, Lift, Confidence)

Association rule mining parameters
1. Support  
Support is a measure of how frequent a item or an item set appears in a 
dataset. For example, what is the support for the item set { Milk + Cheese } 
everytime a customer goes to a shop?

Association rule mining parameters
2. Confidence
Confidence is a measure of how often this rule is found to be true. Or the 
probability that an event will occur given that another event has occurred. 
So what is the probability that a customer who purchases milk will also 
purchase cheese?

3. Lift
Lift defines that strength of the relationship or association of purchasing 
milk and cheese

Association rule mining algorithms
1. Apriori algorithm
●The Apriori Algorithm searches through small datasets to identify 
different rules(associations). In this algorithm, there are product clusters 
that pass frequently, and then strong relationships between these 
products and other products are sought.
●It's designed to efficiently discover frequent itemsets and association 
rules in small datasets.
Association rule: A rule of the form X → Y, where X and Y are itemsets. X is called the antecedent, 
and Y is called the consequent.
Support: The fraction of transactions that contain both X and Y.
Confidence: The probability that Y will occur given that X has occurred.

Association rule mining algorithms
2. FP-Growth algorithm
●The frequent pattern growth algorithm also uses unsupervised 
learning but is more efficient than apriori algorithm
●The algorithm uses a divide-and-conquer approach to generate 
frequent itemsets efficiently. The main idea of the FP-growth 
algorithm is to represent the dataset in a compact form called the 
frequent pattern tree
●Limited to categorical data only.

Association rule mining algorithms
3. ECLAT algorithm
●Equivalence Class Clustering and List Intersection offers a more 
efficient approach compared to Apriori, especially for dense 
datasets.
Key Concepts:
●Equivalence class: A group of items that always appear together in 
transactions.
●Item prefix: The initial part of an itemset.
●Item list: A list of transactions that contain a specific item.
