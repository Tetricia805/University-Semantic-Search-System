ABSTRACT 
This study investigates the perceptions and experiences of journalism students at Uganda 
Christian University regarding media violence and its impact on their professional choices. 
Through a detailed survey of 108 students, the research explores the prevalence of violence 
against journalists in Uganda, the frequency of related news reports, and how such violence 
influences students' career decisions. 
 
Key findings reveal that a significant majority of respondents have not personally witnessed or 
experienced violence against journalists, though a notable minority has. The data indicates that 
violence against journalists is reported infrequently in the media, but a substantial proportion 
of students believe it adversely affects freedom of speech and expression. Concerns about 
violence significantly influence career choices, with many students prioritizing safety in their 
professional decisions. 
 
The study underscores the need for enhanced safety training in journalism curricula, greater 
advocacy for journalist protection, and stronger government measures to ensure journalist 
safety. Enhancing safety procedures, raising public awareness, and encouraging cooperation 
between media outlets and legislators are among the recommendations. Subsequent studies 
ought to concentrate on comprehensive safety protocols, the influence of safety measures on 
the caliber of journalism, and contrasts with other areas. This all-encompassing strategy seeks 
to encourage the creation of a more safe and productive media environment in Uganda while 
addressing the difficulties experienced by journalists.

CHAPTER ONE 
1.0 Introduction. 
When covering protests, reporting from crisis zones, or examining delicate subjects, media 
professionals—including journalists—often come into contact with various forms of violence. 
These professions may experience serious physical, psychological, and emotional effects from 
this exposure to violence. (Kim & Shin, 2022) 
1.1 Background of the study.   
The media is essential in influencing public opinion, encouraging openness, and keeping the 
powerful accountable. However, there are several obstacles for media professionals in Uganda, 
such as intimidation and violence. Print, broadcast, and online media are all present in Uganda, 
and journalists there cover a vast range of topics, from social and economic concerns to politics 
and government. Notwithstanding this crucial role, media workers in Uganda frequently deal 
with intimidation, assault, and harassment while doing their jobs.(Nyarko & Akpojivi, 2017) 
This research proposal aimed to delve into the perceptions of journalism students regarding the 
exposure to violence encountered by media professionals in Uganda, shedding light on the 
attitudes, concerns, and expectations of the next generation of journalists in the country. The 
life of a journalist has become dangerous in many parts of the world(Ross, 1999), it has been 
registered by many organizations and reported about by different agencies in Uganda, majorly 
the Human Rights Network for journalist in Uganda advocates for the rights of journalists who 
experience violence cases while performing their task and duties.(International & Report, 
2014) 
When journalist are attacked, they are not only beaten but their equipment’s like voice 
recorders, video cameras, still photos cameras are destroyed alongside in order to get rid of the 
evidence especially while recording the police or the army beating people during elections or 
peaceful protects in Uganda and Africa as well.(Nyarko & Akpojivi, 2017)In their quest of 
removing the footages from camera, most cameras are confiscated or destroyed in order to get 
rid of the evidence. (Le Cam et al., 2021) 
Lately, Irene Abalo Otto, a former journalist, spended her days lying in bed, resting her injured 
foot, which has had a profound impact on her life. She was at the pinnacle of her journalism 
career, working for the prominent Nation Media Group in Uganda when a fateful afternoon in 
February 2021 changed everything. She was Sent to cover a press conference, which ended up 
being attacked, resulting in a severe leg injury that continues to cause her pain. To this day, she 

2 
 
relies on a foot and ankle support and faces difficulties walking and driving. The physical and 
emotional trauma from that incident forced her to abandon both her job and her studies.(When 
Attacked on the Job, Many Journalists Stay Silent, n.d.) 
The range of grievances reported included physical assault, unlawful arrest and detention, 
interference with radio stations, seizure and destruction of equipment, restrictions on access, 
and cyberattacks. The report underscored a concerning trend, indicating that a significant 
portion of these assaults occurred in the context of elections and political campaigns, 
highlighting the vulnerability of journalists during crucial democratic process.(Ozawa et al., 
2023) 
Physical assaults frequently take place against journalists while they are out in the field 
covering stories for their respective media organizations. Additionally, other forms of violence, 
such as cyberattacks, are directed at journalists at various stages, including during the course 
of their work. It is evident that individuals who perpetrate these acts of violence against 
journalists in Uganda often include members of the police force and military personnel. This 
situation has significantly eroded and had a detrimental impact on the working environment 
for journalists.(Kim & Shin, 2022). On this ground the research will seek at understanding how 
journalism students basically in Uganda Christian University perceive this type of violence  
It has been recorded that female journalist experience large number of violence especially if 
they are reporting from the war zone areas mainly sexual violence.Sexual violence is mostly 
used to silence and intimidate women journalists, and adds that women are additionally 
exposed to attacks because their work challenges gender stereotypes.(Høiby, 2016). 
Understanding this form of violence is key for both male and female journalist therefore this 
work will focus at assessing the level of awareness and understanding among journalism 
students about the various forms of violence, including physical, and online threats, and 
attacks.(Kim & Shin, 2022) 
While a substantial number of attacks against journalists often remain undisclosed, the Human 
Rights Network for Journalists — Uganda, a nonprofit organization established in 2005 to 
champion the rights of journalists, has provided compelling statistics. In 2021, they 
documented 131 cases involving human rights violations and mistreatment of journalists and 
media professionals. Notably, during the height of the pandemic in 2020, these figures were 
even higher, with 174 cases reported. Furthermore, in 2019, an additional 165 cases were 
brought to attention.(When Attacked on the Job, Many Journalists Stay Silent, n.d.) 

3 
 
Basing of such facts, its vital for journalism students to understand and picture what happens 
in the real time practice world and how they interpret such acts in different situation is the 
reason to why this research is intended. 
Journalists like other profession in Uganda are supposed to enjoy the freedom of expression as 
its provided by the constitution of Uganda. The freedom of media is seen in the Article 29(1). 
‘Every person shall have the right to freedom of speech and expression, which shall include 
freedom of the press and other media”(Kimumwe. P, 2014) and the right to seek receive and 
access information, which is the core of a free media, is also provided for in article 41, which 
states that; “Every citizen has a right of access to information in the possession of the State or 
any other organ. (Kimumwe. P, 2014) but this has risen question like to what extent are media 
practitioners free during their work time.  
1.2 Problem Statement. 
The exposure to violence encountered by media professionals in the course of their duties is an 
escalating concern in developing countries, with incidents of physical assaults, verbal threats, 
and attacks becoming increasingly prevalent.(Nyarko & Akpojivi, 2017) This issue raises 
questions about the safety, mental well-being, and overall job satisfaction of journalists.(Le 
Cam et al., 2021) Understanding the perceptions of journalism students regarding this violence 
is crucial, as their future careers will likely entail similar risks.(Groves et al., 2016)However, 
there is a gap in knowledge regarding how journalism students perceive and prepare for the 
challenges associated with violence in the field.(Kim & Shin, 2022) 
1.3 Purpose of the study. 
The purpose of the study is to examine how journalism students perceive and interpret the 
violence media practitioners under go through. 
Research Questions and Hypothesis.  
1.4 Objectives  
To explore the perception of journalism students towards pursuing a career in journalism, 
considering the potential risks of exposure to violence  
To assess the level of awareness and understanding among journalism students about the 
various forms of violence, including physical, and online threats, and attacks. 

4 
 
To assess journalism students' understanding of the ethical dilemmas and responsibilities 
associated with reporting on violence.(International & Report, 2014) 
1.5 Research Questions and Hypothesis 
What factors influence journalism students' decision to pursue o a career in journalism, given 
the prevalence of violence in the field? 
To what extent are journalism students in Uganda aware of the exposure to violence 
encountered by media professionals during their duties? 
What is the level of understanding among journalism students regarding the ethical dilemmas 
and responsibilities associated with their career? 
1.5.1 Hypothesis 1: Journalism students in Uganda are likely to have varying levels of 
awareness regarding the exposure to violence encountered by media professionals during their 
duties, with some having limited knowledge due to lack of comprehensive reporting. 
1.5.2 Hypothesis 2: Media professionals in Uganda are exposed to various forms of violence, 
including physical attacks, threats, and online harassment, which pose significant risks to their 
safety and well-being. 
1.5.3 Hypothesis 3: Journalism students' mental and emotional health is likely to suffer if they 
are exposed to violence while performing their tasks; this could lead to worry, anxiety, and 
reevaluating their career choices. 
1.6 Scope of the Study  
1.6.1 Geographical  
The study will be conducted in the larger geographic setting of Uganda, an East African 
country known for its violent media coverage. In particular, the analysis in this study focuses 
on how Uganda Christian University journalism students perceive media violence. Through 
investigating their perspectives and comprehension of these difficulties, our goal is to acquire 
an understanding of how the upcoming generation of journalists views these important 
matters. 
1.6.2 Content Scope  
This study, which focuses on Uganda Christian University journalism students, attempts to 
understand how the next generation of media practitioners views these important topics and 

5 
 
how they can affect Ugandan journalism in the future. Through an analysis of these students' 
viewpoints, this research provides insightful information on the unique difficulties experienced 
by media professionals in Uganda. It also clarifies how the next generation of journalists might 
handle and overcome these difficulties. 
1.6.3 Time Scope  
This research study will take place between July 2023 and May 2034. This long time span 
makes it possible to provide a thorough analysis of Uganda Christian University journalism 
students' attitudes and views of media violence in Uganda. 
1.7 Justification 
Any democracy must have a free and unrestricted press because it gives the people essential 
information and acts as a check on authority. This freedom is directly threatened by media 
violence against journalists, so it's critical to comprehend how upcoming journalists will see 
and handle these difficulties. The results of this study will highlight the extent to which press 
freedom is in jeopardy and offer insightful information to advocates and legislators who fight 
to preserve democratic norms. 
The views of journalism students will influence the media landscape going forward, as they 
represent the next generation of media professionals. We are able to better prepare students for 
the realities of their profession by looking at their perspectives on violence against journalists. 
This research can help shape curriculum modifications that incorporate safety training, ethical 
instruction, and a strong sense of professionalism and social responsibility in journalism 
education. This, in turn, ensures that these future journalists are well-equipped to report 
ethically, even in challenging circumstances. 
This research's advocacy and awareness component is equally essential. Students studying 
journalism are frequently at the vanguard of social and political movements, lending their 
voices to effect change. Gaining an understanding of their perspectives on violence against 
journalists can result in campaigns for advocacy, increased awareness, and cries for justice. 
This study could serve as a catalyst for constructive change, encouraging society to uphold 
press freedom and confront the problems that jeopardize it. It supports the larger endeavor to 
preserve a strong, independent media and preserve the democratic principles that rely on it in 
this way. 

6 
 
1.8 Significance of the Study  
Examining the viewpoints of journalism students on violence against journalists is extremely 
important. These students will influence the direction, ethics, and values of the media industry 
as future professionals in the field. Knowing their opinions on this matter helps them advocate 
for press freedom, maintain media ethics, and be ready to cover potentially hazardous 
occurrences. 
Through examining their viewpoints, we can acquire significant understanding of the changing 
obstacles encountered by journalists and modify journalism training, media establishments, 
and regulations to more effectively tackle these issues. In the end, this study is an important 
step toward preserving democracy, press freedom, and the ethical standards of journalism. The 
knowledge gathered from this study has the potential to significantly alter journalism's ethics, 
values, and practices, which will have a long-term effect on the media's place in society.  
1.9 Theoretical framework 
1.9.1 Cultivation theory   
Cultivation theory, developed by George Gerbner in the 1960s, is a communication theory that 
explores the long-term effects of television on viewers' perceptions of the social world. The 
theory suggests that prolonged exposure to television content, especially in the portrayal of 
certain themes and messages, can shape and cultivate viewers' attitudes and beliefs about the 
real world(Shrum, 2017) 
Referring to the research, this theory will help in understand how journalism students interpret 
this violence when they watch them on television and what are basically their reactions.  
1.9.2 Agenda-setting theory 
Proposed by Maxwell McCombs and Donald Shaw in the 1960s, agenda-setting theory argues 
that the media has the power to shape the public agenda by highlighting certain issues, which 
then influences the public's perception of what's important(Zain, 2009). The theory is grounded 
in the idea of salience—what stands out becomes significant in our minds. 
Understanding how the media shape people perception is very key in this study therefore I will 
delve into understanding the perception created by the media especially on the student’s 
studying journalism  

7 
 
1.9.3 Cognitive Dissonance Theory 
Cognitive Dissonance Theory, developed by Leon Festinger in the 1950s, explores the 
psychological discomfort that arises when an individual holds conflicting beliefs, attitudes, or 
values(Harmon-Jones & Harmon-Jones, 2007). In the context of media violence, Cognitive 
Dissonance Theory can be applied to understand how individuals reconcile their awareness of 
violent media portrayals with their own beliefs and values, especially when it comes to 
journalism(J. Cooper, 2012). 
1.9.4 Social Learning Theory: 
Albert Bandura's Social Learning Theory offers a framework for comprehending how people 
pick up violent attitudes, behaviours, and norms through modelling, imitation, and observation 
in the context of media violence(E.Grusec, 1992). This theory will help in digesting how the 
journalism students relate their behaviours to what they learn and watch on television 
concerning the media violence. 
1.9.5 Perception theory: 
Perception theory explores how individuals select, organize, and interpret information from 
their surroundings. It's like a mental filter that shapes our understanding of reality. Our 
perceptions are influenced by our past experiences, cultural background, personal beliefs, and 
cognitive biases(Gordon, 2004). 
In the context of communication, perception theory is crucial because it helps us understand 
how people process and make sense of messages. What one person perceives from a message 
might differ significantly from another, leading to diverse interpretations(R. Cooper, 2014). 
Understanding perception is vital for gathering information concerning media violence and 
how it affects the students of journalism in general. Additionally, it enables journalism students 
to foresee and manage possible differences in how their communications will be understood. 
Additionally, it clarifies the difficulties caused by media violence in a multicultural and ever-
changing society(Gordon, 2004).

CHAPTER TWO 
LITERATURE REVIEW 
2.0Introduction: 
This chapter represents the reviewed literature related to the concept of media violence against 
journalists in Uganda. In the landscape of contemporary journalism, media violence against 
journalists stands as a formidable challenge, undermining press freedom and democratic 
discourse in various regions across the globe(Benítez, 2017) The perpetration of violence 
against journalists takes many forms, ranging from physical attacks and verbal abuse to online 
harassment.(Harlow et al., 2022) 
These acts not only hinder the journalists' ability to fulfil their vital roles as purveyors of 
information but also cast a chilling effect on the broader media environment.(Anderson et al., 
2015) While media brutality affects journalists universally, it is paramount to understand how 
different segments of society, particularly journalism students, perceive and respond to this 
phenomenon(Ozawa et al., 2023) 
Examining how journalism students view media violence against journalists in Uganda is 
important because it can provide insight into how journalism education, press freedom, and 
media resilience are changing in the country. Like many other countries, Uganda has struggled 
with media violence issues that have far-reaching effects on the journalism profession as well 
as the larger democratic landscape(When Attacked on the Job, Many Journalists Stay Silent, 
n.d.)This study aims to clarify the complex relationship between education, career goals, and 
the realities of media violence by focusing on the perspectives of journalism 
students.(International & Report, 2014)This approach offers a distinctive perspective on the 
complex difficulties that Uganda's future generation of journalists must overcome. 
2.1 Media landscape in Uganda. 
The early history of mass media in Uganda is marked by the influence of missionaries who 
played a pivotal role in its establishment in the early twentieth century. These early forms of 
media primarily took the shape of religious newsletters However, it was not until 1912 that 
Uganda saw the emergence of its first commercial newspaper, the "Uganda Herald," which was 
published in English and targeted mainly at a European audience (Crystallography, 2016) 
The media landscape in Uganda has always been closely intertwined with the country's political 
structure(M. B. Chibita, 2010). This highlight that the media in Ugandaoperated in an 
alignment to the pollical structure set in place by different pollical players or system in Uganda. 
Uganda faced civil conflicts during President Milton Obote's rule in the 1960s and 1980s and 

9 
 
multiple coup d'états under President Idi Amin's dictatorial regime in the 1970s, during which 
free expression was heavily curtailed (M. Chibita & Fourie, 2007). 
Despite enduring decades of political and economic, Uganda has witnessed progress over the 
last 25 years under President Yoweri Museveni(M. B. Chibita, 2010)When Museveni assumed 
the presidency in 1986, he promised a free press, leading to a surge in the number of media 
outlets and greater journalistic freedom(Tangri & Mwenda, 2010)Vary many media begrun 
newspapers began reporting on corruption scandals involving government officials (Tripp 
2004). The 1990s saw media liberalization, and in 1995, the Constitution of the Republic of 
Uganda enshrined freedom of expression as a fundamental right. 
Today, Uganda's media landscape is home to three English-language dailies, with the 
government-owned "The New Vision" having the highest circulation, approximately 30,000 
copies per day, followed by the independent paper "The Monitor" with a circulation of around 
26,000 (Goretti 2007). Weekly papers such as "The East African," "The Weekly Observer," 
and "Sunrise" coexist alongside "around a dozen TV networks, most of them privately-owned," 
state-run radio, and more than 200 private radio stations (BBC 2017, para. 1). "Radio Uganda," 
the public radio station, broadcasts in 28 languages (Chibita 2009) and holds a substantial 
advantage as it covers the entire country, unlike FM stations that have limited broadcast ranges. 
With government support and funding, "Radio Uganda" can gather news from across the 
nation, particularly through Information Officers stationed in various regions (Goretti 2007, 4). 
Despite the constitutional guarantee of free speech and the proliferation of media outlets, the 
government continues to impose restrictions on journalists. Journalists have been detained, and 
media houses have been temporarily shut down by the government. Reporters and editors face 
charges of libel, sedition, treason, defamation, and other vaguely-worded laws when they 
become too critical of the ruling party (Mwesige 2004; Kalyango and Eckler 2010). Those not 
formally charged frequently experience threats, intimidation, and violence from government 
officials (Reporters without Borders 2020). These pressures have led to increased self-
censorship among journalists (Dicklitch and Lwanga 2003; Kalyango and Eckler 2010). 
Beyond government interference, several other factors have hindered Uganda's media industry 
since its inception, including limited foreign investment, inadequate formal journalism 
training, and scarce resources (Isoba 1980). Insufficient training has resulted in unprofessional 
behaviour, such as accepting bribes. Additionally, journalists are poorly compensated, which 
can lead to media content being geared toward the interests of advertisers rather than the "public 
interest" (Goretti 2009, 121–122). 

10 
 
Despite these challenges, Ugandan journalists are said to be going through a process of 
"journalistic domestication," which involves overcoming growing pains and ultimately 
establishing their own journalistic norms and professional practices (Sobel Cohen and 
McIntyre 2020, 666). Freedom House (2017) has described Uganda as having "one of the more 
vibrant media scenes in east and central Africa" (para. 5-6), and noted that "Museveni has 
received international praise for cultivating a 'relatively liberal media climate'" (Tabaire 2007, 
204). However, it's important to note that much of the discussion about the "liberal" media 
environment in Uganda refers to the presence of numerous private media organizations in the 
country, rather than journalists' ability to report freely. Critics argue that Uganda, as a semi-
authoritarian state, implements just enough democratic policies to appear democratic and 
appease international donors, while ultimately aiming to maintain power. 
 
2.2 Media Violence Against Journalists in Uganda.  
In Uganda, violence against journalists has grown to be a serious problem that needs to be 
addressed. Journalism have been greatly impacted by the long-standing and urgent problem of 
media violence against journalists(Le Cam et al., 2021). Investigating delicate subjects, 
covering political campaigns, or covering events frequently exposes journalists to various 
forms of violence and targets them(Wilson, 2012). A variety of actors, such as security services 
and political figures and their allies, may launch these attacks. 
According to Irene Abalo Otto, a former journalist, sustained a serious leg injury during a press 
conference when she was attacked by a military police officer. This incident forced her to give 
up her journalism career.(When Attacked on the Job, Many Journalists Stay Silent, 
n.d.)Unfortunately, such attacks often go unreported due to a lack of confidence in the justice 
system 
The article cites data from the Human Rights Network for Journalists — Uganda, which 
reported numerous cases of human rights violations and abuses against journalists in the 
country, with a significant increase during election periods. These abuses include assault, 
unlawful arrest, equipment damage, censorship, and cyberattacks. 
Journalists, in the line of duty, face various forms of intimidation and violence from different 
quarters, including security forces, politicians, and their supporters. Many journalists, 
intimidated by their attackers and disillusioned by the lack of justice, either leave the profession 
or choose safer careers to avoid harm. 

11 
 
While there are laws and avenues for pursuing justice, the article emphasizes that successful 
prosecutions of these incidents are rare. In response, some journalists have united to fight 
against the offenders collectively, achieving positive outcomes in some cases. 
The article also underlines the lasting physical and psychological impact on journalists who 
have been victims of such violence. Irene Abalo Otto, for example, now works from home and 
misses the fieldwork she once enjoyed. The pervasive media violence in Uganda is an issue 
that jeopardizes the safety and freedom of journalists and is a significant concern for press 
freedom in the country. 
Joshua Mutale was documenting a demonstration by women opposing an increase in police 
brutality when the incident occurred. Armed with a recording device in one hand and a set of 
earphones in the other, Mutale was focused on capturing the voices and stories of these women, 
a task fundamental to his role as a journalist. Little did he anticipate the sudden and shocking 
turn of events that would unfold before him(Nyarko & Akpojivi, 2017) 
As he was immersed in his work, a policeman, hardly identifiable, suddenly appeared on the 
scene. In a startling and unprovoked act, this officer unleashed pepper spray directly into 
Mutale's eyes using a hand spray. The painful and disorienting effects of the pepper spray 
incapacitated Mutale, causing him to fall to the ground. Fortunately, his fellow journalists who 
were present rushed to his aid, helping him cope with the effects of the attack(Nyarko & 
Akpojivi, 2017) 
In 2020, at least Ten journalist were beaten by military police when they were covering the 
opposition leader Robert Kyagulanyi, known as 'Bobi Wine,' as he delivered a petition to the 
United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Kampala. His petition 
was a protest against human rights abuses and abductions of his supporters surrounding the 
contested presidential election. 
During the period of elections, journalist often suffer in the hands of police while doing their 
work and during the eve of 2016 general elections where the government employed a lot of 
crime preventers who could act under the ideal of protecting crimes in Uganda(Royal & 
Society, 2023). These were the police who were causing chaos to journalist are were even 
arrested and put under charges for no good reason.  
2.3Types of Violence Against Journalists: 
Journalists in Uganda, like their counterparts in many parts of the world, face a multitude of 
challenges and forms of violence in the course of their work(Ozawa et al., 2023). These 
challenges encompass physical violence, verbal abuse, online harassment, sexual harassment, 

12 
 
and censorship(Høiby, 2016). This research delves into these segments to shed light on the 
complex and sometimes hard environment in which journalists operate in Uganda. 
2.3.1 Physical Violence: 
The use of force or other physical acts intended to harm or injure another person is referred to 
as "physical violence" (Krantz & Garcia-Moreno, 2005). One of the most evident and alarming 
forms of assault against journalists in Uganda is physical violence. Journalists often find 
themselves in the middle of heated circumstances, like political rallies, protests, and conflict 
zones. In these settings, they are the targets of physical attacks from several angles. (Jackson 
& Ashley, 2005) 
For instance, during the preparations for the 2021 elections in Uganda, there have been 
complaints of security personnel physically beating journalists covering opposition 
demonstrations. Moses Bwayo was detained, beaten, and sent in police jail in November 2020 
while he was photographing opposition leader Robert Kyagulanyi's arrival at his party's office. 
Bwayo's career was shattered.  Similarly, journalist Ashraf Kasirye was shot by the police in 
December while covering a Kyagulanyi demonstration and sustained injuries. This physical 
violence can take many different forms, including beatings, shootings, and even the 
deployment of tear gas or rubber bullets. These tragedies serve as a reminder to journalists of 
the dangers associated with covering politically controversial events. 
2.3.2 Verbal Abuse: 
Journalists are abused both physically and verbally in Uganda. Many persons, including 
members of the public, politicians, and government officials, may be the source of this. Anxiety 
and intimidation of journalists is a typical objective of verbal abuse, which promotes a culture 
of fear and self-censorship. 
The police chief, Martin Okoth Ochola, intimidated individuals during a press conference in 
January 2021, shortly before the elections. Declaring quite frankly that "we shall beat you 
journalists for your own sake." Such remarks not only encourage an environment of impunity 
but also create a hostile environment for journalists who are merely carrying out their duties. 
This increases the level of insecurities within the working arena of journalism because they 
feel as if they are not protected by the law since Martin Ochola who is the chief in command 
of the police therefore this affect journalist while performing their work(Ek et al., 2013) 
2.3.3 Online Harassment: 
Journalists in Uganda, like those across the globe, are subjected to cyberbullying, hate speech, 
and harassment on social media platforms and other online spaces because of their reporting or 

13 
 
affiliations with particular media outlets(Blackwell et al., 2017).The digital age has given rise 
to new kinds of harassment, one of which is online harassment. 
According to report on online violence against women journalists, conducted by UNESCO and 
the International Centre for Journalists (ICFJ) in late 2020. The survey had over 900 validated 
participants from 125 countries, and the findings primarily focus on the responses of the 714 
women-identifying participants(Posetti et al., 2020). 
The report aligns with the UN Secretary General's statement that women journalists, 
particularly those covering topics like politics, law, economics, women's rights, gender, and 
feminism, are more likely to be targets of online violence(Posetti et al., 2020). The key impacts 
mentioned are the disproportionate severity of online violence against women journalists and 
the correlation between certain subject areas and the frequency of attacks 
Online abuse comprises spreading false information about the journalist, threatening messages, 
and hate speech. It not only negatively impacts the mental health of journalists but can also 
have real-world repercussions like physical attacks or legal harassment Legal 
Harassment(Walulya & Selnes, 2023) 
2.3.4 Presss Censorship: 
Press censorship is the practice of restricting, managing, or preventing the media from 
disseminating information, frequently carried out by governments or other authorities. Both 
state and non-state actors have the ability to impose censorship, which can take many different 
forms.(Cain, 2014) 
The state and non-state actors have the ability to censor content, which can restrict media and 
freedom of speech. Suppressive measures used by governments to restrict media freedom 
include punitive laws, threats, sanctions, and physical authority. These measures are 
collectively referred to as state censorship(Cain, 2014) 
In Uganda, critical media outlets run the risk of closure, license suspensions, and sanctions. 
The government frequently uses security forces to apprehend journalists who refuse to comply. 
Governments can also employ strategies such as hacking media websites, obstructing news 
sites, surveilling journalists electronically and online, and limiting or prohibiting internet 
access to impose state censorship on contemporary media(Cohen & Mcintyre, 2020). 
According to (Waisbord, 2020) on  mob censorship, which is a form of bottom-up non-physical 
violence perpetrated by unaffiliated individuals or groups, often in the context of online 
harassment of journalists. Mob censorship can involve attacks, trolling, abuse, and harassment 
of journalists, particularly on social media platforms. Unlike state and market censorship, 

14 
 
which are often influenced by specific interests or entities, mob censorship is characterized by 
actions from social media users or vigilantes(Waisbord, 2020). 
Government representatives who wish to control the narrative and determine what can and 
cannot be reported may exert influence over media outlets. In order to essentially silence media 
outlets, authorities may also revoke their licenses or shut them down. Threats against media 
owners or financial pressure in the form of advertising boycotts can occasionally be used to 
control media content. (Cohen & Mcintyre, 2020). 
2.4 Implications and Consequences: 
There are important ramifications to the many sorts of assault and harassment Ugandan 
journalists face. They primarily jeopardize press freedom and the media's watchdog function 
in society. When journalists are subjected to violence and harassment, their ability to hold 
people in positions of authority accountable is jeopardized. (Cohen & Mcintyre, 2020). 
Journalists are forced to self-censor due to the atmosphere of fear created by these violent and 
harassing acts. Because they fear for their safety, they could refrain from reporting on particular 
subjects or occurrences, which reduces the breadth and depth of news reporting. (Waisbord, 
2020) 
These actions also weaken public confidence in the media. When journalists are targeted and 
silenced, the public's access to accurate and diverse information is curtailed, leading to a 
decline in trust in media outlets and journalism as a profession(Cain, 2014). 
 
2.5. Journalism Education in Uganda: 
Journalism is a field of work and a profession that involves collecting, reporting, and analyzing 
news and information to inform the public. Journalists, also known as reporters or 
newsmen/women, play a crucial role in providing the public with accurate and timely 
information about current events, issues, and developments in society. Here are some key 
aspects of journalism(Zelizer, 2005) 
In Uganda, for you be considered as a professional journalist you needed to having studied 
journalism at diploma level or degree in any of the renowned institution in Uganda like Uganda 
Christian University, Makerere University, and other renown university in Uganda or outside 
Uganda. For someone to operate withing the sphere of journalism or media field should have 
studied in any related field to journalism.  
In Uganda, a person who is interested in a career in journalism and wants to become a 
professional journalist or media practitioner is known as a journalism student. These 
individuals usually enrol in journalism programs at universities, colleges, or journalism 

15 
 
schools, where they study the theoretical and practical aspects of reporting, writing, and 
communicating news and information. 
2.6 Obstacles Ugandan journalism students must overcome 
2.6.1 Access to Internship Opportunities: 
Although getting practical experience through internships is crucial for journalism students, 
there may not be as many excellent internship options as there once were. This could affect 
their ability to use theoretical information in real-world situations. 
2.6.2 Limited Resources: 
Many journalism programs in Uganda might not have as much funding as they could have, 
for example, if they don't have access to contemporary technology, media production 
equipment, or library resources. This might have an impact on the training and experience 
students receive in the actual world. 
2.6.3 Safety Concerns: 
Ensuring the safety of journalism students studying sensitive themes like political instability 
or corruption is a big challenge when it comes to investigative reporting. 
2.6.4 Digital Transformation: 
Journalism is evolving along with digital technology. New technologies, internet journalistic 
methods, and social media reporting may be challenging for students to become used to. 
Keeping up with the rapid changes in the media industry requires constant learning. 
2.6.5 Limited Networking Opportunities: 
Establishing professional networks is crucial for students studying journalism. However, a lack 
of industry contacts and networking opportunities may make it difficult for them to break into 
the workforce. 
2.6.7 Media Regulation and Freedom of the Press: 
The Ugandan press freedom and regulatory framework may have an impact on journalism 
students. Striking a balance between open reporting and following legal requirements can be 
challenging. 
2.7 Perception of Media Violence: 
In common terminology, perception is defined by Longman Dictionary of Contemporary 
English as “a) the way you think about something and your idea of what it is like; b) the way 
that you notice things with your senses of sight, hearing etc.; c) the natural ability to understand 
or notice things quickly.”1 In philosophy, psychology, and cognitive science, perception is the 
process of attaining awareness or understanding of sensory information. The word “perception” 

16 
 
comes from the Latin word’s perception, perception, and means “receiving, collecting, action 
of taking possession, and apprehend 
2.8 Gaps in Research: 
Numerous studies have been conducted discussing the kinds of violence that media 
professionals encounter, but they don't go deeply into comprehending the communities, 
individuals, and political party supporters. Subsequent investigations may explore the reasons 
behind these assaults and the trends they adhere to. Targeted interventions can be informed by 
knowledge of the underlying causes and recurring themes in attacks on media 
practitioners.(Nyarko & Akpojivi, 2017) 
 
When attacked while performing their duties, many journalists stay silent because they fear to 
spread the information and their lives from the people who are always after them. This has 
greatly contributed to the increments in the concept of media violence(When Attacked on the 
Job, Many Journalists Stay Silent, n.d.) 
 
While researching about the online attacks on journalist, some of the attacks include comments 
that denigrate women's bodies and discredit journalists' reportage, it doesn't delve deeply into 
the specific forms and tactics of online harassment. Further research could explore the nuances 
of these attacks, identifying patterns and variations in the types of harassment women 
journalists face.(Walulya & Selnes, 2023)

CHAPTER THREE: RESEARCH DESIGN  
 
3.1 Study Area. 
 
The study will be carried out in Uganda Christian university main campus which I located in 
Mukono. Uganda Christian university is a private institution which offer a number of course 
around campus 
3.2 Study population size.  
 
The population size of students pursuing journalism at Uganda Christian university is 
estimated as  150 by. 
3.2.1 Sample size determination. 
Sample Size Calculation 
the sample size nnn can be calculated using the formula 
n=       N*Z2*p*(1-p) 
     (N-1)-E2+Z2*p*(1-p) 
In this Case 
 
NNN is the population size (150) 
 
ZZZ is the Z-score; at a 95% confidence level, this corresponds to the desired degree 
of confidence (usually 1.96). 
 
ppp is the population's estimated proportion; 0.5 maximizes the sample size, making it 
a safe choice if the true proportion is unknown. 
 
EEE is the margin of error (commonly set at 0.05 for a 5% margin of error). 
Therefore  
n=       150*1.962*0.5*(1-0.5) 
     (150-1)*0.52+1.962*0.5(1-0.5) 
 
n=       150*3.8416*0.25 
     149*0.0025+3.8416*0.25 
 
n=       144.06 
     0.3725+0.9604 

18 
 
 
n=       144.06 
            1.3329 
 
n= 108.1 
 
According to calculation, the approximate sample size of the population is 108 people who 
should be considered to achieve a 95% confidence level with 5% margin of error.  
 
3.4 Sampling Method 
Stratified Random Sampling: 
Stratified random sampling is a useful strategy because of the size of the population, the 
requirement for representativeness across various year groups, and maybe additional 
demographics. This is how I will determine the Stratified random sampling  
Divide the population into different strata (e.g., year of study: Year 1, Year 2, Year 3). 
1. Determine Stratum Sizes: basing on this, I will determine the total population of year 
1, year 2 and year 3 to identify which number of people should I Identify in each class 
group in order to get the real time result.  
 
Year 3      (70)    x 108 = 50.4 
                (150) 
 
Year 2      (50)    x 108 = 36 
                (150) 
 
Year 1      (30)    x 108 = 21.6 
                (150) 
 

19 
 
3.5 Questionnaire Development.  
In order to gather information and enough data, the research will have data collected through 
questions formulated in the questionnaire. This may include key concepts like age, year of 
study, and perception questions like how often do you hear about media violence.  
3.5. 1 Sources of Data.  
Primary Data 
The primary data for this research will be collected from the students of journalism at Uganda 
Christian university Main campus Mukono. 
Secondary Data.  
The secondary data will be identified from the research document, articles and peer review 
papers in order to give a proper understanding of what the research is basically all about.  
3.6 Data collection Methods.  
Basing of the nature of ten research, data will be collected through distribution of questionnaire 
to different group of students pursuing journalism. This will be done both physical and 
electronic or online. I will distribute the questionnaire to different people physical and send 
questions through the Google forms for people who can’t access the physically form in order 
get questions answered  
Secondly data will be collected through analysing different research published papers 
concerning Violence against journalist in different parts of the Africa scaling down to Uganda 
which is at the fore front of this investigation  
3.6.1 Structured Interview. 
The stracture interview was sechuded for the Year ones who have just joined campus. This 
concept helped to bring the year on board to engage in discussions inorder to get the 
information we wanted therefore stactured interview was done.  
3.6.2 Data Analysis 
The following techniques will be applied to the analysis of the gathered data. 
1) Frequency Distributions: To show the frequency of various answers and to summarize 
the data basing on responses of students in different year.  
2) Central Tendency Metrics: I calculated the mean, median, and mode for important 
variables in order to have real important information which shows the perception of 
different peoples doing journalism.  

20 
 
3.6.3 Deductive Statistics: 
1) T-tests and ANOVA: To find any significant differences, the mean scores from various 
groups the research was conducted in consideration of this key format (such as study 
year and gender) was compared. 
2) Correlation Analysis: To look at how certain variables, such awareness levels and how 
violent media is perceived, relate to one another was taken into account in order to 
generate data 
3) Regression analysis: To find variables that predict students' awareness and perceptions 
I employed this analysis ideal to rate the understanding and students’ level of awareness 
concerning violence against journalists. 
Ethical consideration 
During data collection, students were asked for their willingness to answer the questionnaires 
or not, those who were not interested in answering the questionnaire were left to go therefore 
seeking concerns before anything was key and that’s one of the major ethical ideal used.  
Confidentially was also registered as the information which ere asnwerd by students were never 
shared to anyone outside this research. 
Limitation.  
Students’ willingness to answer the questionnaire delayed the process of carryong out this 
research.

Chapter 4 Presentation of Result 
4.0 Introduction. 
During this research, i use the SPSS software to analyse that which I collected from the 
public. SPSS is one of the best Data Analysis tools that can be used to give meaning to the 
data. The data was solely collected within Uganda Christian University among the student’s 
pursuing degree in journalism media and communication.  
4.1 Descriptive analysis of the demographic characteristics of respondents. 
The researcher established a demographic characteristic of the respondents to show clearly

The information supplied sheds light on the frequency of violence against journalists in Uganda 
and is based on witness or personal experience reports of such incidents. 92 respondents, or 

22 
 
85.2%, said they had not directly seen or witnessed violence against journalists, compared to 
16 (14.8%) who said they had witnessed or experienced it first-hand out of 108 respondents.  
Values for frequency and % provide a clear picture of the circumstances. The large proportion 
of respondents (85.2%) who said they had never witnessed or experienced violence raises the 
possibility that, although violence against journalists does occur, it may not be frequent within 
the sample. The minority of 14.8% who have either witnessed or experienced violence, 
however, is noteworthy and raises concerns about a problem in Ugandan media.

The information given reflects opinions on how frequently news stories or conversations 
about violence against journalists occur in Uganda. Of the 108 respondents, most (79.6%) 
said they had only infrequently encountered these kinds of conversations. This implies that 
the majority of people do not frequently discuss or hear about violence against journalists in 
the news or in public. However, just 20.4% of respondents said they deal with these problems 
on a weekly or monthly basis, suggesting that a smaller portion of the public is more 
immediately aware of this kind of violence.  
This violence has a substantial effect on Uganda's freedom of speech and expression. Fear 
and intimidation sparked by violence against journalists might result in self-censorship and 
less media coverage of delicate subjects.

There is broad agreement among respondents when it comes to their views on how violence 
against journalists affects the right to free speech and expression. 50 out of 108 respondents, 
or 46.3 percent, "Strongly Agree" that violence has an impact on the freedom of speech and 
expression. This high percentage suggests that the sample group has serious concerns.  
Following closely, 38 respondents (35.2%) "Agree" with the statement. When combined with 
the "Strongly Agree" group, this makes up a majority of 81.5% of the respondents. This 
indicates a widespread belief that violence negatively impacts freedom of speech and 
expression. Those who agree, while not as emphatic as the strongly agreeing group, still 
recognize the adverse effects of violence on these freedoms. This consensus suggests that the 
issue is widely acknowledged and may be a significant concern in the community or 
demographic represented by the sample. 
 
10 responders, or 9.3% of the sample, are still "Neutral." This group's ambivalence or 
ambiguity regarding the effect of violence on the right to free speech and expression is reflected 
in their neither agreement nor disagreement with the statement. According to this group's 
stance, there is room for differing opinions and a need for a more nuanced understanding even 
though there is a strong belief in the negative impacts of violence. 
 
Lastly, 10 more respondents (9.3%) "Disagree" with the statement, holding the opinion that the 
right to free speech and expression is unaffected by violence. According to this minority 
opinion, some respondents either do not think that there is a link between speech repression 
and violence or think that other variables have a greater bearing on issues related to freedom 
of expression. 
 

24 
 
Approximately 82% of participants said they "Agree" (35.2%) or "Strongly Agree" (46.3%) 
that violence against journalists has an impact on the right to free speech and expression. This 
suggests that there is a general understanding of the damaging effects that violence can have 
on the media landscape. On the other hand, just 18.6% of respondents said they "Disagree" or 
were "Neutral" on this matter, indicating that a small percentage of people do not believe that 
violence 
poses 
a 
serious 
threat 
to 
the 
right 
to 
free 
speech.  
This information suggests that the general worry about safety and freedom of expression may 
have a major influence on journalism students' career decisions in Uganda with regard to how 
violence against journalists influences such decisions.

According to research on how violence against journalists affects career decisions, a 
considerable proportion of participants (37%) express that violence has a highly important 
impact on their career decisions. This implies that the possibility or actuality of violence plays 
a significant role in these people's decision-making when it comes to their profession choices. 
They probably pick occupations where they feel safer or where there are less chances of 
violence. 
18.5% of the respondents, or a moderate fraction, said that violence has had a moderate impact. 
This implies that although violence is a component in their professional decisions, it is not the 

25 
 
main one. These individuals may consider the potential of violence in addition to other 
variables like interest in the field, employment availability, or compensation. 
9.3% of the sample reports that violence has little to no impact on their professional decisions. 
These respondents' minimal consideration of violence suggests that they are either confident in 
their ability to manage or mitigate the risks or that other reasons outweigh their concerns about 
violence. 
The smallest percentage (7.4%) says that their career decisions are greatly influenced by 
violence. Because they believe they can handle any potential risks or because they perceive 
their chosen industries to be low risk, these respondents probably feel that violence has little to 
no influence on their decisions.

The information on 108 respondents' career path  choices offers a perceptive look at trends and 
preferences in the media and communication industries. Public relations, print journalism, 
broadcast journalism, digital journalism, and investigative journalism are the professional 
options selected. Every category showcases people's varied preferences and interests in 
different facets of communication and journalism. 
Print Journalism  
Despite the issues facing the business, print journalism—chosen by 15.7% of respondents—
remains an important professional choice. The comparatively smaller percentage illustrates 
how traditional print media has been losing ground as a result of the emergence of digital 
platforms. However, this ruling emphasizes the print media's enduring value and power. Those 
who choose this course of action most likely value the depth of study and the longevity that 
print offers. 
Broadcast Journalism  
With 27.8% of respondents preferring to work in broadcast journalism, this is the most 
popular option. This selection highlights how well-liked and powerful television and radio 
are as sources of news. Broadcast journalism is an efficient and captivating way to reach a 
wide audience by fusing audio and visual narrative. 
Digital Journalism  
Of the respondents, 18.5% chose digital journalism as an example of the growing importance 
of online news platforms in the contemporary media landscape. The digital sphere offers 
unparalleled opportunities for creative storytelling by including multimedia elements such as 
movies, music, and interactive graphics. Digital journalism was likely drawn to responders 
because of the immediacy and flexibility of internet platforms, which allow for speedy news 
distribution and real-time audience participation. 
Investigative Journalism 
15.7% of respondents chose investigative journalism, indicating a significant interest in in-
depth and impactful reporting, much like print media. This field requires a dedication to 
uncovering hidden truths and bringing powerful entities accountable, often involving great 
risk and difficulties. Those who pursue investigative journalism do so because they are driven 

27 
 
by a passion for justice and the truth and are willing to commit significant time and effort in 
thorough research and reporting. 
Public Relations. 
Public relations, which involves managing relationships and communication between 
organizations and their publics, was selected by 22.2% of respondents as their area of 
interest. A strong interest in media relations, reputation management, and strategic 
communication is evident in this career decision. People who choose public relations 
probably believe that it provides stability and a variety of difficulties, which sets it apart from 
typical journalism professions. The comparatively large proportion suggests an understanding 
of the role that communication plays in influencing public opinion and the allure of 
collaborating across industries, from the corporate to the nonprofit sector

According to data on how safety concerns affect professional decisions, a sizable percentage 
of respondents consider safety to be extremely important when making decisions. In particular, 
42.6% of respondents said that safety issues have a "great deal" or "somewhat" influence on 
their employment decisions, while 31.5% said it had some impact. This indicates that more 
than 70% of respondents said that safety played a significant or moderate role in their choice 
of career. Conversely, 16.7% feel that safety issues influence them "Not much," and 9.3% feel

Have you ever reconsidered pursuing a career in journalism due to concerns about safety and 
security? 
A mixed picture emerges from the data on trust in media companies' capacity to safeguard 
journalists. According to the data, 24.1% of respondents are "Very confident" and 33.3% are 
"Confident," indicating that 57.4% of people have a good or neutral opinion of the efficacy of 
media organizations' defensive measures. But 24.1% of respondents are "Not confident," 
suggesting that a sizeable portion of respondents have reservations about the effectiveness of 
the safety precautions offered. Furthermore, 18.5% of respondents are still classified as 
"Neutral," indicating a lack of conviction or ambiguity regarding the media companies' 
ability tosafeguard.  
This distribution points to a lack of confidence in media companies' ability to protect 
journalists. Their professional decisions may be influenced by the substantial percentage of 
unconfident respondents. When paired with earlier research demonstrating a significant 
impact of violence on journalists.

According to statistics about respondents' revaluations of their career choices in light of safety 
concerns and violence against journalist, 31.5% of respondents had done so, whereas 68.5% 
had not. This suggests that a sizable number of people are directly impacted by safety worries, 
which may have an influence on their decisions and aspirations for their careers.  
 
Concerns regarding the safety and security of journalists are evident in the fact that more than 
30%  have changed their minds about pursuing a career in media. The previous data, which 
indicated that many respondents thought safety issues greatly impact their employment 
decisions, supports this concern. The difference between those who have changed their minds 
and those who haven't implies that, although some people place a high value on safety, a greater

The survey data pertaining to the perception that safety precautions for journalists enhance the 
caliber of journalism offers a convincing perspective on the relationship between journalists' 
well-being and security and their professional output. The replies are classified as "Agree," 
"Neutral," "Strongly Agree," and "Disagree," indicating the different levels of agreement 
among the 108 participants. 
The vast majority of responders, 56 out of 108 (51.9%), "Strongly Agree" that journalist safety 
precautions raise the caliber of reporting. This strong affirmation is indicative of a general 
understanding that there is a direct link between the caliber of journalism and the safety of 
journalists. Journalists are more willing to cover conflict areas, go after in-depth stories, and 
cover delicate subjects without fear of retaliation when they feel safe. Because of their 
increased confidence, journalists are able to cover topics more thoroughly and accurately, 
delving deeper into the subjects at hand. 
While to a lesser extent, 32 respondents (29.6%) said that they "Agree" with the proposition. 
When combined with the "Strongly Agree" group, this shows that more than 80% of 
respondents agree that safety precautions improve the caliber of journalism. Those that concur 
probably understand that good journalism is a result of several elements, safety being just one 
of them. Nonetheless, the combined majority agreement shows a common understanding that 
protecting journalists from threats, violence, and intimidation is crucial to ensuring that they 
can carry out their duties without being subjected to unjustified interference or censorship. 
12, or 11.1% of the sample, are classified as "Neutral," denoting a lack of agreement or 
disagreement with the statement. This neutrality may stem from the belief that other 
components—such as professional training, editorial independence, and information 
accessibility—are equally, if not more, significant in determining the standard of journalism. 
In conclusion, 8 respondents (7.4%) selected "Disagree" with the statement, meaning they do 
not believe safety precautions have a significant impact on the caliber of journalism. This 
minority view may result from the belief that editorial policies, institutional backing, and 
personal ethics are more important to the integrity and quality of journalism than safety 
considerations. Those who disagree might also think that, under some conditions, an 

31 
 
excessive focus on safety could lead individuals to self-censor or avoid significant but 
dangerous tales.

Data on their sentiments indicate a discernible level of dissatisfaction with government 
measures to protect journalists. A very small percentage of respondents—just 4.6% selected 
"Strongly Agree," and 9.3% selected "Agree"—believe that the government is now taking 
sufficient measures to safeguard journalists. On the other hand, a substantial 20.4% "Strongly 
disagree" and 51.9% "Disagree" were expressed regarding the notion that the government is 
effectively shielding journalists. Moreover, 13.9% of respondents rate themselves as "Neutral," 
reflecting skepticism or disinterest in the administration's plans.  
According to the data, there is a definite and widespread discontent with the government's 
efforts to safeguard journalists. With more than 70% of respondents "Disagreeing" or "Strongly 
Disagreeing" with these measures' efficacy, it is clear that there is substantial skepticism 
regarding the suitability of government actions to protect journalists. The low percentage of 
respondents who indicated they "Agree" or "Strongly Agree" (13.9%) indicates that there is 
little faith in these metrics' efficacy. 
This distribution suggests a widespread perception that the government does not provide 
sufficient protection for journalists. The large proportion of respondents who disagreed or 
strongly disagreed points to a notable discrepancy between the demands of journalists and the

perceived 
efficacy 
of

Based on statistics about involvement in journalist safety advocacy actions, just 18.5% of 
respondents reported being part of such campaigns, compared to a significant 81.5% who did 
not. This discrepancy implies that although there is some activity, most respondents do not 
actively

in 
campaigns 
to 
promote 
the 
safety 
of 
journalists.  
In light of this, it is imperative to stress how important it is to teach journalism students about 
safety and security protocols. The low level of activism suggests that some students of 
journalism might not be actively involved in promoting their own or their colleagues' safety. 
For this reason, it is crucial to provide journalism students with thorough instruction on security 
and safety. Such instruction can improve their awareness and equip them with the skills 
necessary to navigate and mitigate hazards.

For journalism students, the majority of respondents (55.6%) believe that training is "extremely 
important." This resounding majority indicates that there is broad agreement on the crucial role 
that thorough training plays in the growth of journalism students. The high percentage indicates 
a perception that thorough training is crucial to providing students with the abilities, 
information, and moral foundation required for a fruitful career in journalism.  
There is broad agreement that journalism students should be trained on safety and security 
procedures, according to research on the subject. In particular, 37% and 55.6% of respondents, 
or 92.6% of the total, believe it to be "Very Important" and "Extremely Important," 
respectively. Just 7.4% of respondents think it is "Moderately Important," and none of them 
gave 
it 
a 
worse 
ranking.  
The strong support for safety and security education highlights how important it is in preparing 
journalism students for their future employment. With the data on activism and government 
initiatives indicating a high level of worry about safety, training provides students with the 
necessary abilities to manage risks, potentially lessening the harmful effects of violence and 
enhancing 
their 
performance.

Diverse perspectives can be seen in the data regarding Uganda's perceived press freedom. In 
particular, 18.5% of respondents think press freedom is present to a "High extent," while 27.8% 
think it is present to a "Moderate extent." Still, a sizable 33.3% believe press freedom is at a 
"Low extent," and 20.4% believe it is at a "Very low extent."  
A greater percentage of respondents (27.8%) say that violence has a "Moderate Extent" 
influence on their employment decisions. This implies that although these people consider 
violence to some extent when choosing a vocation, they do not consider it to be the primary 
determinant. Instead, they might think about violence in light of other factors like hobbies, 
future employment, or job satisfaction. 
The majority of participants (33.3%) think that violence has a "Low Extent" impact on their 
professional decisions. This implies that while violence may be considered, it has minimal 
influence on their career decisions. These respondents may prioritize other factors over 
concerns about violence, such as opportunity, skills, and career objectives. This high figure 
suggests that violence does not substantially influence the career paths of many people. 
24% of the respondents believe that violence has a "Very Low Extent" impact on their 
professional decisions. This implies that these people consider violence to be essentially 
unimportant while making employment decisions. Other than violence, these elements are 
probably going to have a much bigger impact on this group's career prospects. This answer 
confirms the idea that worries about violence are subordinated to one's career or personal 
interests. 
The data presents a varied picture, with different people experiencing different effects of 
violence on their employment choices. While worries about violence have a big impact on 
some people, they have no effect on others. This variation emphasizes how crucial it is to 
realize that a variety of factors interact to impact job selections, and while violence may be a 
major issue for some people, it is not always the main factor.

Consequences: The total lack of "Yes" replies indicates that, in this specific sample, no one has 
reported experiencing intimidation or harassment because of their journalism. This could mean 
that the respondents have not experienced these kinds of problems or that they believe their 
workplaces are safe and free from these kinds of outside pressures.

CHAPTER FIVE:  SUMMARY OF FINDINGS, CONCLUSIONS AND 
RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
5.1 Introduction 
This chapter summarizes all findings reported in chapter four according to questions of the 
study, draws conclusions, suggests recommendations and also proposes some areas for further 
study. 
 
5.2 Summary of the findings  
 
5.2. 1 Personally Experienced or Witnessed Violence Against Journalists in Uganda 
According to the research, 85.2% of participants had not directly witnessed or experienced 
violence against journalists in Uganda. This implies that the majority of the sample does not 
commonly experience violence against journalists. But 14.8% of respondents said they have 
either witnessed or experienced such violence, bringing attention to a serious problem. While 
the low number of first-hand interactions does not inherently lessen the severity of the issue, it 
does suggest that, although violence may not be common among this group, a sizeable minority 
is nonetheless concerned about it. 
5.2.2 News Reports or Discussions About Violence Against Journalists in Uganda 
Based on the responses, 76.6% of participants said they infrequently hear or see news stories 
about violence against journalists. This sporadic interaction implies that most people do not 
find violence against journalists to be a prominent topic of discussion or coverage in the media. 
Merely 20.4% of participants engage in these conversations on a weekly or monthly basis, 
suggesting a restricted yet discernible cognizance of the matter. The rarity of these stories may 
be a factor in the general public's ignorance of the seriousness of violence against journalists 
in Uganda. 
5.2.3 Belief that Violence Affects Freedom of Speech and Expression 
Respondents' perceptions of how violence affects their ability to express themselves freely are 
strikingly positive. Significantly, 81.5% of respondents agree or strongly agree that attacks on 

37 
 
journalists have an impact on the right to free speech and expression. According to this 
consensus, the majority of respondents think that violence severely limits journalists' freedom 
to report freely and honestly. To completely comprehend the connection between violence and 
freedom of expression, it may be necessary to have more in-depth conversations or obtain more 
information, as indicated by the 18.6% of respondents who are neutral or disagree. 
5.2.4 Extent of Influence on Career Choices Due to Violence 
Respondents' professional choices are influenced by violence against journalists to differing 
degrees. A noteworthy 37% indicate that the likelihood of violence has a very high degree of 
influence, indicating that it is a major factor in their professional choices. Another 27.8% of 
respondents say that violence has a high degree of influence, indicating that it plays a 
significant role in their decision-making. On the other hand, 7.4% of respondents believe that 
violence has very little influence on their professional choices. This discrepancy highlights how 
differently people feel about violence and how it affects their professional trajectories 
5.2 5 Career Path Consideration 
Diverse interests in the media and communication industries are revealed by the professional 
paths chosen by the respondents. Broadcast journalism is the most often selected field (27.8%), 
with public relations coming in second (22.2%). 15.7% of respondents are drawn to print 
journalism, 18.5% are drawn to investigative journalism, and 15% are drawn to print 
journalism. This distribution demonstrates the wide range of interests and inclinations among 
journalism students about many facets of media work. The fervent interest in public relations 
and broadcast journalism points to a desire for prominent and exciting positions in the media 
and communication. 
5.2.6 Influence of Safety Concerns on Career Choice 
For many of the responders, safety concerns have a major impact on their employment 
decisions. Significantly, 42.6% of respondents say that safety issues have a significant 
influence on their employment decisions, while 31.5% admit that safety worries have some 
impact. This suggests that for more than 70% of respondents, safety is a key issue when 
selecting a job route. On the other hand, 16.7% and 9.3% say that safety issues have little to no 
impact, indicating that for some people, other considerations take precedence over safety 
worries. 
5.2.7 Confidence in Media Organizations' Ability to Protect Journalists 
There is differing opinions about how well media outlets can safeguard journalists. A 
considerable 24.1% of respondents are not confident, and 18.5% are indifferent, despite the 
fact that 57.4% of respondents express confidence (24.1% very confident and 33.3% 

38 
 
confident). This distribution suggests that opinions on the efficacy of the safeguards that media 
organizations provide for journalists are not in agreement. The varying degrees of confidence 
point to a possible disparity in the perception of security and assistance for journalists. 
5.2.8 Reconsidering Pursuing a Career in Journalism Due to Safety Concerns 
Concerns about safety have caused a noteworthy 31.5% of respondents to reevaluate choosing 
a profession in media. This suggests that a sizable percentage of people consider safety 
concerns while making professional decisions. The remaining 68.5% have not changed their 
mind about their job choices, indicating that even while many people have serious safety 
concerns, most people are not discouraged from pursuing a career in journalism. 
5.2.9 Safety Measures for Journalists Improve Quality Journalism 
The information shows a significant conviction that safeguards for journalists improve the 
caliber of journalism. 29.6% of respondents agree and the majority (51.9%) strongly think that 
safety measures improve journalism. This consensus is a reflection of the knowledge that the 
quality and depth of reporting are directly correlated with the safety of journalists. 7.4% 
disagree, and a smaller minority (11.1%) are neutral, suggesting that while safety is crucial, 
other variables also affect the caliber of journalism. 
5.2.10 Government Measures to Protect Journalists 
There is a general dissatisfaction with the government's efforts to safeguard journalists. The 
majority of respondents—72.3%—either strongly disagree (20.4%) or disagree (51.9%) with 
the sufficiency of government protective measures. The percentage of responders who agree 
or strongly agree that government actions are effective is just 13.9%. This substantial 
dissatisfaction points to a discrepancy between the real government measures and the perceived 
needs for journalist protection 
5.2.11 Participation in Activities That Advocate for Journalists to be Violence-Free 
Merely 18.5% of the participants engage in lobbying endeavors that guarantee a violence-free 
environment for journalists. This low level of participation suggests that, although there is some 
involvement, most respondents are not actively involved in this kind of campaigning. This 
shows that there is a need for increased awareness and participation in ensuring the safety and 
protection of journalists. 
5.3.12 Journalism Students Training Requirement 
Regarding the significance of training for journalism students, there is broad agreement. 92.6% 
of respondents think that training is very important (37.0%) or extremely important (55.6%). 
This resounding consensus highlights how important training is in equipping journalism 
students for their future employment, especially in handling safety and security issues. 

39 
 
5.3.13 Level of Press Freedom in Uganda 
Perceptions of press freedom in Uganda are varied. While 18.5% view press freedom as high, 
27.8% see it as moderate. A significant 33.3% believe it is low, and 20.4% view it as very low. 
This diverse range of opinions indicates a complex and potentially challenging environment 
for press freedom in Uganda. 
5.3.14 Intimidation or Harassment While Practicing Journalism 
None of the interviewees mentioned being harassed or intimidated while working as a 
journalist. The absence of occurrences mentioned could indicate that the sample operates in a 
safe environment or that the respondents have not personally dealt with these problems. 
5.3.15 School of Journalism Preparation for Challenges 
There are differing views on how well journalism programs prepare students for the demands 
of the industry. 37% think that the level of preparation is moderate, compared to 27.8% who 
think it is done to a high degree and 9.3% who think it is done very high. Notably, 26% believe 
that preparation is done to a very low or low degree. This variation shows that opinions about 
how well the existing training programs are prepared students for issues they will face in the 
real world vary. 
 
5.4 Conclusion 
The study shows that there are many moving parts when it comes to how violence affects 
Ugandan journalism students. Although a significant 14.8% of participants had firsthand 
experience with violence against journalists, the majority of respondents—76.6%—perceived 
the occurrence of such violence as rare. Despite this, there is broad agreement—81.5% of 
respondents—that violence has a detrimental effect on the freedoms of speech and expression. 
37% of respondents have a very high impact, indicating that safety issues have a substantial 
influence on their work decisions. 
Even though safety has a big impact on career trajectories, only 18.5% of people actively 
advocate for journalist safety, and a big portion of them are unhappy with the steps the 
government is taking to safeguard journalists. The research also reveals a perceived lack of 
readiness on the part of journalism schools to address safety issues. Overall, despite the fact 
that safety concerns have a significant impact on the impressions and decisions journalism 
students make about their careers, there is still a noticeable divide in activism, trust in 
institutional protections, and educational preparedness.

5.5 Recommendation 
Better Safety teaching: Journalism schools must include comprehensive safety and security 
teaching in their curricula. This training should provide useful methods for managing risks, 
handling violence, and ensuring individual safety. Students prepare for real-world scenarios 
with regular workshops and role plays. 
Increase Advocacy: It is necessary for professionals and students to be more involved in the 
struggle for the protection of journalists. It may be more beneficial to promote active 
participation in initiatives and campaigns aimed at safeguarding journalists in order to solve 
safety issues. 
Improve Government Measures: The study shows a significant degree of dissatisfaction with 
the current measures that the government has put in place to protect journalists. Media 
organizations, advocacy groups, and journalists should work together to press for stricter laws 
and enforcement mechanisms in order to ensure the safety of journalists. 
Promote Collaboration: Increasing collaboration across media outlets, public bodies, and 
international organizations can help to create a network of support for journalists. Through 
sharing best practices, support systems, and resources, overall security and safety can be raised.
