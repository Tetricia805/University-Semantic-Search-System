The purpose of the study is to present financial accountability mechanisms in local governments, with 
reference to Kabale district local government. A cross-sectional research design, which used both 
quantitative and qualitative approaches to collect and analyze data, was adopted. Both simple random 
and purposive sampling techniques were used to select 117 respondents from 174 subjects. 
Questionnaires and personal interviews were used to collect data from respondents. Frequencies and 
percentages were used to analyze quantitative data, while direct quotes from interviews conducted 
among key informants formed the basis for qualitative analysis. Quantitative analysis was aided by 
software for document analysis (SPSS V 20.0). The study found out that service delivery was the most 
commonly used financial accountability mechanism, followed by financial reporting, expenditure 
control and budget. The paper therefore, concluded that service delivery is the most used mechanism 
of financial accountability, though the district’s local budget seemed unclear on reflecting the priorities 
of the local people. This paper suggests that the local government should ensure that the district’s 
budget demonstrates community preference; salaries and wages should be paid in accordance with the 
district’s approved budget; expenditures on development should always be as per the approved 
budget, and the mode of financial reporting, particularly on liabilities should be standardized. 
 
Key words: Financial accountability, expenditure control, financial reporting, service delivery, budget. 
 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
In government, financial accounting entails the recording, 
communicating, summarizing, analyzing and interpreting 
financial statement in aggregate and in details (Onuarah 
and Appah, 2012). It is required that government 
accounts meet internal management  requirements  while 
providing the public with a window on government 
operations. Achua (2009) explains that ggovernment 
financial reports would have been prepared with the 
objective of providing full disclosure on a timely basis of 
all material facts relating to government  financial position

and 
operations. 
However, 
many 
public 
sector 
organizations seem to undermine this practice. For 
instance, Kiyemba (2018) shows incidences of infective 
budgetary controls that are fueled by fraud and 
corruption, and personal interests over community 
preferences in Wakiso district. Overseas Development 
Institute (2018) shows how Ministry of Finance introduced 
a 
Budget 
Transparency 
Initiative 
to 
promote 
accountability and service delivery in Uganda. However, 
sustainability of the initiative failed due to weak 
coordination of activities and failure to understand 
expected roles and expectations between central and 
local governments. Government of Uganda has over the 
years introduced a number of reforms aimed at 
enhancing 
transparency, 
accountability 
of 
public 
resources 
and 
improved 
service 
delivery. 
The 
government adopted the practice of open and transparent 
budget consultative process, which was further enacted 
by Public Finance Management Act 2015. Workshops 
have been organized to consult all stakeholders 
(development 
partners, 
local 
governments, 
central 
government ministries and departments) at National and 
local government levels to guide in the process of priority 
setting and resource allocation (MOFPED, 2017). One of 
the 
key 
milestones 
in 
reforming 
public 
finance 
management in Uganda has been the decentralization of 
the payroll management. However, the limited internet 
infrastructure and technical capacity to operate the IFMS 
are still a challenge (Munyambonera and Lwanga, 2015). 
Kabale district local government formulates her Budget 
Frame Work Paper by involving all stakeholders and 
continues to emphasize decentralized and participatory   
development 
planning 
and 
budgeting 
process 
as 
stipulated in the Local Government Act CAP 243 under 
section 36 (3). The Local Government Budget Framework 
Paper outlines district interventions for social and 
economic development in the fiscal year. Kabale district 
local government suffers from inadequate local revenue 
collections 
due 
to 
political 
influence 
and 
poor 
administration and fluctuating indicative planning figures 
from 
central 
government 
(Kabale 
District 
Local 
Government, 2015), which have inched on the district‟s 
financial accountability. While the (Auditor General, 2017) 
does 
not 
indicate 
incidences 
of 
poor 
financial 
accountability, cases of inadequate controls surrounding 
management of domestic arrears and understaffing at the 
district remain critical and unattended to. Despite the 
many years of decentralization policy in Uganda, and 
numerous efforts to reform the local government system 
(Auditor General, 2017; Eton et al., 2018:106), financial 
accountability at local government remains a challenge in 
Uganda. It‟s upon these bases therefore the researchers 
conducted this study.  
 
 
LITERATURE REVIEW 
 
From the theoretical perspective,  financial  accountability 
 
 
 
 
was discussed in view of the Principal-agent theory. The 
principal, who are the citizens grant some authority to the 
agents (politicians and civil servants) to act on their 
behalf (Shah, 2007; Agwor and Akani, 2017; Gailmardy, 
2012). The principal-agent theory relates the customer 
(principal), who pays for services or goods, and the 
agent. More than often, however, the agent least does 
what the principal expects (Hlavaeek and Hlavaeek, 
2006), yet the principal is limited in his ability to monitor 
and judge the contractor‟s input and output (Keil, 2005), 
which leads to mistrust and can only be avoided under 
high monitoring costs. In ideal situations, the public 
empowers government officials to promote public welfare 
using public resources. However, more often than none, 
government officials serve their own interests, which 
jeopardize service to the public. According to (Berner and 
Smith, 2004) accountability is interpreted as the ability of 
the principals (public) to question the conduct and 
behavior of the agents, and to impose sanctions where 
such conduct or behavior falls short of the requirement. 
This would be demonstrated in the ballot box on the side 
of the politicians, but how about the civil servants? In 
growing democracies, the agents override the principals, 
thus denying them full participation in their demand for 
accountability of the actions of the agents (Cabannes, 
2005) to the point of denying them full participation 
through 
information 
exchange. 
Principals 
only 
disseminate information to advance their own self-
interests and to maximize their own utilities (United 
Nations, 1999). According to Birskyte (2013), the public 
attempts to demand accountability from politicians and 
civil servants however, a wider range of principals lack 
the capacity to hold agents accountable. This research 
argues that while the public can be involved in 
demanding accountability from politicians and civil 
servants, the public is also driven by personal interests, 
political patronage, resource shortage and foreign 
backings. In turn, the agents do not consider the targets 
of the constituent principals. In other words, the principal-
agent-theory cannot apply in dynamic situations where 
power is not directly delegated. As people continue to 
look to politicians for cash in exchange for their votes, 
this implies a decrease in their legality to demand 
accountability (United Nations, 2005). Since resources 
are in the hands of an elected government, people must 
be corrupted by accepting bribes for their votes, which 
constrains effectiveness and delivery of public goods. 
 
 
FINANCIAL ACCOUNTABILITY 
 
Accountability is generally defined as accepting and 
meeting one's personal responsibilities, being and feeling 
obligated to another individual as well as oneself, and 
having to justify one's actions to others (Wilson et al., 
2010). Accountability has frequently been presented as 
rational practice to ensure responsibility by individuals 
and institutions,  which  should  be implemented in all civil  

 
 
 
 
societies, economic institutions and organizations (Agwor 
and Akani, 2017). He noted that the traditional tools of 
accountability 
are 
often 
considered 
by 
non-profit 
organizations as unnecessary formal tasks and excessive 
bureaucracy, which can have important consequences 
both organizationally and managerially. According to 
(Onuarah and Appah, 2012),  accountability focuses on 
the extent to which feedback recipients perceive they are 
responsible 
for, 
utilizing 
feedback 
information 
for 
development. A sound system of public expenditure 
management needs to take into account the wider values 
and requirements of society. Accountability, transparency, 
predictability and participation are important instruments 
for sound budget management, but also have an intrinsic 
value, and are generally seen as the four pillars of good 
governance. If budget managers do not comply with 
parliament's authorizations, or if public funds are used for 
private purposes, it is doubtful whether either aggregate 
fiscal discipline or efficient resource allocation, or both, 
will be achieved. Financial accountability is about 
assuring its stakeholders regarding the use of public 
resources (stewardship) as well as to underpin decision-
making about how to allocate scarce resources like time, 
personnel, space, equipment and money (Doussy and 
Doussy, 2014).  The allocation of resources may affect 
the entire operation and success of an organization, 
which often hinges on the quality of its financial 
management. Thus public entities have to provide 
information about financial activities to its stakeholders in 
order to discharge financial accountability. Financial 
accountability is a very important component of the public 
sector financial management process. 
 
 
Financial accountability mechanisms 
 
Expenditure controls 
 
There is a tendency for spending on wages and salaries, 
goods and services and other items of recurrent 
expenditure to be higher than the approved budget, and 
for spending on the development budget to be lower than 
the 
approved 
amounts. 
The 
under 
spending 
in 
development expenditure is mainly due to capacity 
limitations, weak project implementation and possibly a 
lack of reporting on execution of donor-funded projects 
(Cabannes, 2005). Overspending in the recurrent budget 
can be attributed to weaknesses in expenditure controls, 
including inadequate commitment controls. The lack of 
data integrity is a big issue, both for aggregate and 
individual budget items, thus reducing the overall quality 
of financial reports. Credibility in public expenditure is 
assessed by comparing aggregate expenditure out-turn 
to original approved budget, compositions of expenditure 
out-turn to original budget and aggregate revenue out-
turn to original approved budget (PNG Government, 
2015). However, Hladchenko (2016) advises that when 
the  resource  envelope  allows,  the  government  should  
Arinaitwe et al.           101 
 
 
 
shift its policy focus towards improving the quality of 
public expenditure. Such restraints normally arise from 
the weak budget forecast.  
Annual financial reports, which are a reflection of final 
budget outcome, may indicate an overall level of budget 
execution which was in line with the initial approved 
budget. For example, a very small difference between 
original and executed budget can be explained by the 
supplementary budget that was adopted in-year and 
helped reallocate expenditure among sections (Dunleavy 
et al., 2006). This helps to increase the overall level of 
budget execution. Without this supplementary budget, 
most public entities operate under-execution of the 
budgets. Similarly, Pelizzo and Stapenhurst (2013) noted 
that it is possible for the recurrent budget to appear 
overspent while the development budget is regularly 
under-executed. These two items broadly compensate at 
the overall level. At the end of the year, departments tend 
to transfer lapsing funds into trust accounts, which results 
into a recorded increased level of budget execution even 
though these transfers represent no more than an 
accounting transaction between different government 
accounts (Lytvynchuk, 2014). Effective expenditure 
control is attained when the extent to which the 
composition of expenditures differs from the original 
approved budget is compared, and that public entities 
can predict the extent to which the budget is predictable, 
reliable and reflects the implementation of stated public 
policy (Pelizzo and Stapenhurst, 2013; Pillay, 2013). This 
suggests that documents containing a large amount of 
detailed information with vast accompanying narrative 
should be provided. In a related view, Miller (2012) adds 
that any discrepancies in the data for total revenues and 
expenditures should be presented in the documents. A 
lack or shortage of information on important fiscal 
indicators such as the debt stock, financial assets, fiscal 
risks and tax expenditures, in addition to a medium-term 
budget framework impinges on the level of financial 
accountability. Moreover, presenting the development 
budget for each agency in the same section as the 
current budget, and modifying the definitions of the 
development budget would reflect genuine capital 
expenditure (Shah, 2007). 
 
 
Financial reporting 
 
Financial reporting plays a major role in fulfilling 
government‟s duty to be publicly accountable in a 
democratic society. Financial reporting is used in 
assessing accountability by comparing actual financial 
results with the legally adopted budget, assessing 
financial condition and result of operations, assisting in 
determining compliance with financial laws and assisting 
in evaluating efficiency and effectiveness (Wang, 2013). 
The accounting profession through oversight bodies, 
developed  certain  international  rules  and guidelines on 

102          J. Account. Taxation 
 
 
 
how financial information is treated and communicated so 
that measurement and presentation are less subjective 
(Kumar et al., 2012). These guidelines and rules for 
preparing financial statements are commonly known as 
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), The 
International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), the 
International 
Accounting 
Standards 
(IASs) 
and 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs). 
These standards start with a conceptual framework which 
anchors financial reports to a set of principles such as 
materiality (the degree to which the transaction is big 
enough to matter) and verifiability (the degree to which 
different people agree on how to measure the 
transaction) (Beyer and Guttman, 2012). The standards 
establish which resources and obligations should be 
recorded as assets and liabilities, which changes in 
assets and liabilities should be recorded, when these 
changes should be recorded, how the recorded assets 
and liabilities and changes in them should be measured, 
what information should be disclosed and which financial 
statements should be prepared (Li, 2005). That is, the 
standards prescribe recording and reporting practices 
that are deemed to be acceptable when reporting on the 
financial affairs of an entity.  
Today, all public institutions in Uganda are adhering to 
IFRSs to ensure the same understanding of the 
information by both the preparers and users of that 
information. The enforcement of accounting standards 
improves the quality of financial reporting (Auditor 
General, 2017). Unfortunately, literature recognizes that 
measuring the quality of financial reports like the financial 
statements is problematic especially because different 
users may perceive the usefulness of information very 
different from each other (Indriasari, 2008; Rabrenovic, 
2009; Hladchenko, 2016). This is associated with the fact 
that most of the stakeholders will not have the ability or 
need to analyze the financial statements in detail or test 
the compliance with accounting standards. Therefore, 
concentrating on characteristics like understandability, 
comparability, verifiability and timeliness (Kedia and 
Philippon, 2003), which enhance faithfulness and 
representation to citizens, politicians, donors, government 
and NGOs; is far better. Stakeholders like CSOs and 
community members could be probably only interested in 
whether the statements are trust worthy, that no 
corruption took place, the budget were complied with and 
that the organization in question is in a position to provide 
value for money (Graham et al., 2006). Therefore, 
financial statements must be transparent and easy to 
understand to enable making informed decision.  
While the definition of financial accounting system 
points to set of procedures from data recording to financial 
reporting in order to answer budget implementation, 
financial accounting system can be measured by five 
dimensions: the accounting of cash, the accounting 
procedures, cash outlays, the accounting procedures 
assets,  the   accounting   procedures   in  cash,  and  the  
 
 
 
 
presentation of financial reports. In government however, 
financial accountability statements are about accounting 
standards, which are structured to report on the financial 
position reporting entity (Elliot and Elliot, 2012). This 
suggests that emphasis of reporting is laid on 
accountability dimension, presentation dimension and 
disclosure. As the organization processes and reviews its 
accounting material, a systematic approach to the 
identification, analysis, evaluation, endorsement and 
periodic review of decisions taken involving such material 
is provided, which spans a number of accounting areas. 
However, at the end of the day, the final financial 
statements will include amounts based on judgments, 
estimates and assumptions by management (South 
African Institute of Chartered Accountants (SAICA), 
2012).  
A consolidated local government financial statement is 
prepared annually that includes full information on 
revenues, expenditure and financial assets including 
revenue arrears. These annual statements however, do 
not provide a full reporting on liabilities. They do not 
provide any information on expenditure arrears or 
accounts payable (Kabale District Local Government, 
2015). Under the cash accounting system the source 
document for accounting entries is the payment voucher 
coupled with the electronically generated cheque or other 
payment instruction. Entries are dated using the date on 
the payment instrument. It is important to note that 
auditing is a crucial component of most modernist 
conceptions of accountability since it legitimates the 
information on which formal, financial accountability rests 
(Shulman et al., 2013).The fundamental role of an auditor 
is to provide independent assurance to external users 
that a financial report of an entity is accurate and reliable.  
 
 
Service delivery  
 
A service is an activity or a series of activities of more or 
less intangible nature that normally, but not necessarily, 
takes place in interactions between the customer and 
service employees and/or systems of service providers, 
which are provided as solutions to customer problems 
(Bajo et al., 2017). Service delivery can be taken to be an 
outcome of performance depending on the context in 
which it is used (Yeo and Neal, 2004). According to 
(Birskyte, 2013), service can be expressed in terms of 
capacity to deliver desired services and from which 
customers get satisfaction. A service delivery gap is that 
gap between the established delivery standards and the 
actual service delivered (Goncalves, 2013). It is an 
inconsistency 
between 
service 
design/quality 
specifications and the actual service quality by the 
service delivery system. Effective engagement between 
citizens, service providers and elected representatives is 
essential to democratic service delivery.  
Service  delivery refers to programs or services that are 

 
 
 
 
provided either to the general public or to specifically 
targeted groups of citizens, either fully or partially using 
government resources. This includes services such as 
education and training, health care, social and community 
support, policing, road construction and maintenance, 
agricultural support, water and sanitation, and other 
services (Salahu, 2012). He observes that service delivery 
excludes those services provided on a commercial basis 
through public corporations. Similarly, (Public Expenditure 
and Financial Accountability (PEFA), 2016) points out 
that service delivery excludes policy functions, internal 
administration, and purely regulatory functions undertaken 
by the government, although performance data for these 
activities may be captured for internal management 
purposes. It also excludes defense and national security 
(Agwor and Akani, 2017).  
Quality of service delivery has emerged as the most 
significant 
strategy 
in 
ensuring 
the 
survival 
of 
organizations and also a fundamental route to business 
excellence as well as extending market share of health 
care organizations. Service provision that is de-linked 
from citizen-influence and democratic decision making is 
unlikely to deliver quality services for the poor (Omolaye, 
2015). For meaningful contributions, the poor require the 
ability and capacity to ask questions and, sufficient 
information of their right and entitlements, service 
options, local and national budgets, and the systems to 
address when decisions are taken undemocratically or 
when services are of poor quality. Local governments are 
assumed to be performing if the projects and services 
meet the demands of the citizens in the local areas 
(Agwor and Akani, 2017). 
Shah (2007) insists that service delivery has to be 
communicated over and over again to everyone. 
Employees at all levels must be aligned with a single 
vision of what the organization is trying to accomplish. 
Thus, effective internal communications is the requisite 
for integration and harmony in the service organizations 
activities and quality. Public Expenditure and Financial 
Accountability (2016) also emphasizes that the goal of 
any social service organization is to improve the results 
of the target population in some way by providing the 
right type of services and by providing them in an 
appropriate and adequate way.  
 
 
Budget 
 
Budget is a plan of financial operation embodying an 
estimate of proposed expenditures for a given period of 
time and the proposed means of financing them. In a 
much more general sense, budgets may be regarded as 
devices to aid management in operating an organization 
more 
effectively. 
Governments 
build 
budgets 
to 
demonstrate compliance with laws and to communicate 
performance effectiveness (Wilson et al., 2010). It is 
worth noting that financial  accounting  and  management 
Arinaitwe et al.           103 
 
 
 
accounting cannot be so neatly compartmentalized in the 
public sector, where management accounting refers to 
budgeting and control, rather than accounting solely in 
the service of managers. The budget is an expression of 
public policy and political preferences (Tsurkan et al., 
2016). It is an instrument of fiscal policy on revenue and 
spending to achieve macroeconomic objectives. It 
provides benchmarks for performance measured partly 
by the accounting system. Given their close relationship, 
it is often difficult to tell where budgeting ends and 
accounting begins. They reinforce each other in 
demonstrating and discharging fiscal accountability to the 
government's stakeholders, who are more numerous and 
diverse than the owners of a firm.  
Budgeting is an important mechanism for financial 
planning and management and, as a cyclical decision-
making process, it allows for the achievement of 
organizational priorities and objectives through limited 
fiscal resources. The correct application of budgeting can 
contribute significantly to greater efficiency, effectiveness 
and accountability within any organization if a level of 
synergy exists between the policy direction and the fiscal 
framework (Berner and Smith, 2004). Being part of the 
control environment relating to the efficient, effective and 
economic utilization of resources, budgets are also an 
indistinguishable part of the broader planning and policy 
environment. Similarly, (Mikesell, 2007) expresses that a 
budget‟s importance in a democratic setting should be 
aligned to both the legislative and executive management 
environments and emphasizes publicity, amongst others, 
as a core principle of any budget (Neblo et al., 2010). In 
essence, publicity requires budget openness and 
transparency during all the stages of the budgeting 
process, which include executive recommendation, 
legislative consideration and budget execution.  
In budgeting, this means uniting administrators, who 
have information on municipal finance and budgetary 
processes, with their constituents, who have information 
on their own preferences (Kim et al., 2010). This 
suggests that combining of information leads not only to 
new information but also to new understanding. The 
budget measures the extent to which aggregate budget 
expenditure outturn reflects the amount originally 
approved, 
as 
defined 
in 
government 
budget 
documentation and fiscal reports (Omolaye, 2015). He 
notes that aggregate expenditure includes planned 
expenditures and those incurred as a result of 
exceptional events such as armed conflicts or natural 
disasters; and expenditures financed externally by loans 
or grants should be included. However, if amounts are 
held in suspense accounts at the end of any year that 
could affect the scores if included in the calculations, they 
can be included. The budget recognizes that it is prudent 
to include an amount to allow for unforeseen events in 
the form of a contingency vote, although this should not 
be so large as to undermine the credibility of the budget 
(Salahu,  2012).  Where  part  of  the  budget is protected 

104          J. Account. Taxation 
 
 
 
from spending cuts for either policy (for example, poverty 
reduction spending) or regulatory reasons (for example, 
compulsory welfare payments), this will show up as a 
composition 
variance 
(Berner 
and 
Smith, 
2004). 
Assessors are requested to report on the purpose and 
extent of protected spending in the narrative. 
Accurate revenue forecasts are a key input to the 
preparation of a credible budget. Revenues allow the 
government to finance expenditures and deliver services 
to its citizens. Overly optimistic revenue forecasts can 
lead to unjustifiably large expenditure allocations that will 
eventually require either a potentially disruptive in-year 
reduction in spending or an unplanned increase in 
borrowing 
to 
sustain 
the 
spending 
level 
(Public 
Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA), 2016). 
On the other hand, undue pessimism in the forecast can 
result in the proceeds of an over-realization of revenue 
being used for spending that has not been subjected to 
the scrutiny of the budget process (Mikesell, 2007). As 
the consequences of revenue under-realization may be 
more severe, especially in the short term, the criteria 
used to score this indicator allow comparatively more 
flexibility, when assessing an over-realization. 
A robust classification system allows transactions to be 
tracked throughout the budget‟s formulation, execution, 
and reporting cycle according to administrative unit, 
economic category, function/sub function, or program 
(Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA), 
2016). The budget should be presented in a format that 
reflects 
the 
most 
important 
classifications. 
The 
classification should be embedded in the government‟s 
chart of accounts (the accounting classification) to ensure 
that every transaction can be reported in accordance with 
any of the classifications used. In the same line, Tsurkan 
et al. (2016) argue that the budget and accounting 
classifications should be reliable and consistently applied, 
providing users with confidence that information recorded 
against one classification will be reflected in reports 
under the other classification. In view of national budgets, 
a set of budget supporting documents must be provided 
by the executive to the legislature for scrutiny and 
approval. These documents provide a complete picture of 
central government fiscal forecasts, budget proposals, 
and outturn of the current and previous fiscal years 
(Mikesell, 2007). The arrangements for providing transfers 
from central government to sub national governments 
and the timeliness of information on those transfers ought 
to be captured. Financial reporting by sub national 
governments and fiscal risks to central government from 
sub national governments are addressed to governments 
through their budgets, or through conditional (earmarked) 
grants to sub national governments to implement 
selected service delivery and expenditure responsibilities 
(Salahu, 2012). The overall level of grants is usually 
determined 
by 
policy 
decisions 
at 
the 
central 
government‟s discretion or as part of constitutional 
negotiation  processes.   However,  clear  criteria  for  the  
 
 
 
 
distribution of grants among sub national governments 
are needed to ensure a locative transparency and 
medium-term predictability of funds available for planning 
and budgeting of expenditure programs by sub national 
governments (Edeme and Nkalu, 2017). He further 
clarifies that every fiscal transfer from central government 
to the relevant sub national governments should be taken 
into consideration.  
Legislatures play a critical role in the management of 
public finances. As part of their budget decision-making 
responsibilities, legislatures approve the national budget 
and subsequently provide oversight as the executive 
implements the budget (Wilson et al., 2010). The 
challenge that remains with local government budgets is 
timeliness of reliable information provided to sub national 
governments on their allocations from central government 
for the coming year. It is crucial for sub national 
governments to receive information on annual allocations 
from central government well in advance of the 
completion (and preferably before commencement) of 
their own budget-preparation processes. Information on 
transfers to sub national governments‟ budgets should be 
regulated by the central government‟s annual budget 
calendar, which should provide for reliable information on 
allocations early in the cycle (Public Expenditure and 
Financial Accountability (PEFA), 2016). 
 
 
METHODOLOGY  
 
The study adopted a cross-sectional research design. This type of 
research design measures differences between or from among a 
variety of people, subjects, or phenomena rather than a process of 
change. Data was collected in a single interface with respondents 
and a report was produced. Quantitative approaches were used to 
collect and analyze data on financial accountability constructs 
(expenditure control, financial reporting, service delivery and 
budget). The target population included local government staff, 
elected leaders, and civil society leaders identified from Kabale 
district local government (central division, town councils, sub 
counties). These categories of the population were contacted 
because they are part of financial accountability in addition to 
having enough experiences on financial accountability in the 
district. The study comprise of a total of 174 study units, constituting 
100 staff, 42 elected leaders, and 32 civil society leader. The target 
population was stratified into three strata that is staff, elected 
leaders, and civil society leaders. Proportional allocation was 
employed to determine the number of participants to be taken from 
each stratum. This resulted into taking 67 staff, 29 elected leaders, 
and 21 civil society leaders, which was equivalent to a sample size 
of 117. Purposive sampling was used to select the CAO, District 
chairperson, and town clerks while simple random sampling was 
used to select the staff, elected leaders, and civil society leaders. 
The CAO, District chairperson, and town clerks were purposvely 
selected because of their vast knowledge of public finance 
management and accountability expectations.Questionnaires and 
interview methods were used to collect primary data. The CAO, 
district chairperson, and town clerks were interviewed while the rest 
of the staff, elected leaders, and civil society leaders were served 
with questionnaires. A structured questionnaire with close-ended 
questions was designed. The items were developed from literature 
review. The  questionnaire  had  two  sections  that is a background 

 
 
 
 
section and a basic section. The background section had 7 items 
covering background characteristics. the basic section, which was 
directly related to financial accountability mechanisms had four sub-
sections. Expenditure control had 6 items, financial reporting had 8 
items, servide delivery had 7 items while budget had 7 items. All the 
items on financial accountability mechanisms were scale-items, 
measured on a 5-point likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly 
disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Collected data was sorted and 
entered into SPSS version 20. The software was used to help in 
generating percentages of counts for each item used in the 
questionnaire. The researcher summarized percentage data into 
disagreement (an aggregate of strongly disagree and disagree), 
agreement (an aggregate of strongly agree and agree) and „not 
sure‟. 
 
 
RESULTS  
 
Background characteristics  
 
Participation according to gender indicates that 78.9% 
were male while 21.1% were female. In respect to age 
distribution, 43.1% belonged to (40 - 49) years of age and 
constituted the majority, 27.5% belonged to (30 - 39) 
years, 17.4% belonged to (50 and above) years while 
11.9% belonged to (20 - 29) years and constituted the 
least participation, which suggests that most of the 
participants were adults with a high degree of reasoning 
and maturity, which were essential in the study. 
Regarding their marital status, In line with marital status, 
75.2% indicated to be married and were the majority, 
19.3% were single while only 6 participants representing 
5.5% indicated the “others” option. In terms of the highest 
level of education revealed that 58.7% were tertiary 
graduates, 24.8% were university graduates while 16.5% 
indicated secondary as their highest level of education. 
According to their experience in local government 
activities, 52.3% had (5 -9) years‟ experience with the 
local government, 26.5% had not worked with the local 
government for more than 5 years while 21.1% had 
worked with the local government for 10 years and over.  
 
 
Financial accountability mechanisms used in Kabale 
district local government. 
 
The study investigated three mechanisms of ensuring 
financial 
accountability 
in 
Kabale 
district 
local 
government. These were expenditure control, financial 
reporting, service delivery and the budget. Table 1 
presents the details of the findings. Bringing to light the 
aspect of expenditure control as a mechanism of 
ensuring financial accountability in Kabale district local 
government, 89.9% that the district local government‟s 
resource envelope is adequate enough to allow for 
quality public expenditure, while 85.3% confirmed that the 
district‟s overall budget execution is always in line with 
the official approved budget and the district council is 
committed to spending within the budget (71.5%).  
Actually, Kabale is a stop-off point for  tourists  to  Lake 
Arinaitwe et al.           105 
 
 
 
Bunyonyi and the two parks famous for mountain gorilla 
tracking: 
Mgahinga 
national 
park 
and 
Bwindi 
impenetrable national park. In moderate presentation, 
64.2% confirmed that the district‟s financial reports 
always indicate a very small difference between the 
original and the expected budget, 62.4% confirmed that 
the money spent on development is lower than the 
approved budget, while 54.1% confirmed that council 
spends more on salaries and wages than is approved in 
the budget. On the whole, expenditure control as a 
financial accountability mechanism in Kabale district 
appears to stand at 71.2%. 
In relation to financial reporting as a financial reporting 
mechanism, 92.7% confirmed that the overall budget 
execution is achieved under supplementary budget, 
83.5% confirmed that the financial reporting system is 
compliant with financial laws, while 80.7% indicated that 
the reporting system has a standard for recording assets. 
In a related view, 78.9% confirmed that the local 
government‟s 
financial 
information 
is 
treated 
in 
accordance with international rules and guidelines, which 
makes district‟s reporting system to demonstrate quality. 
Though participants confirmed that their financial reports 
are easily understood by users (76.2%), they also 
moderately 
indicated 
that 
financial 
information 
is 
presented in a less subjective manner (61.5%) and that 
the reporting system has a standard for recording 
liabilities (57.8%). On the whole, financial reporting as a 
financial accountability in Kabale district local government 
appears to stand at 76.3%.  
In view of service delivery, 88.1% confirmed that the 
district runs projects that are intended to improve citizens‟ 
welfare, 82.6% confirmed that the services delivered by 
the council are indeed of the right type, 81.7% agreed 
that the projects implemented by the council meet the 
demand of citizens in the local area. About 79.8% agreed 
that the district delivered quality services, are a 
guarantee of their tight (74.3%) and reflect citizens‟ 
participation in decision making (70.7%). On a slightly 
lower end, 64.2% agreed that district council solves 
citizen‟s problems. On the whole, service delivery in 
Kabale district local government appears at 77.3%.  
In line with budget as a mechanism of financial 
accountability in Kabale district local government, 87.1% 
indicated that budget demonstrates political preference. 
In moderate view points, 56.9% agreed that the budget 
demonstrates a sound financial system, 55.0% agreed 
that the budget is a true measure of council‟s 
effectiveness while 51.4% agreed that the budget is a 
true measure of council‟s efficiency. It should be noted 
that 47.8% disagreed with the view that the budget 
enables council to attend to priorities in the local area, 
40.4% 
disagreed 
that 
the 
budget 
demonstrates 
community preference, while 35.8% disagreed that the 
budget enables council to utilize resources economically. 
The above statistics suggest a politicized and biased 
position on the budget as a policy document. In the same

line of observation, one respondent reiterates: “…any 
government that delivers quality services, which are 
consistent with community interests and that promotes 
the private-sector growth alongside proper management 
of public resources is not far from the Millennium 
Development Goals…” (Civil Society Advocate). However, 
it remains evident that since the budget in Kabale district 
is a demonstration of political preference, it is true that 
local area priorities and preference are ignored, which 
renders  council  inefficient.  Similarly,  if  the  budget  can 
hardly demonstrate a sound financial system, the council 
stands to inefficient in its utilization of economic 
resources. On the whole, the budget, as revealed by the 
statistics suggests a non-performing budget represented 
by 52.3%. The findings are in agreement with the opinion 
of one key informant: “…Mayors have the powers to 
implement their policy preferences but these should not 
suppress citizens’ interests…” (Sub County Speaker). In 
practice, competing 
interests should be 
analyzed 
democratically than politically suppressing them. It should  

 
 
 
 
be noted that out the four mechanisms of financial 
accountability used in Kabale district local government, 
service delivery (77.3%) and financial reporting (76.3%) 
appear to be two practices that propagate sound financial 
accountability.  
 
 
DISCUSSION  
 
The study sought to establish the financial mechanisms 
that are used in Kabale district local government. 
Participants pointed to service delivery are the most 
important mechanism of financial accountability in Kabale 
district local government. The findings are line with 
(MOFPED, 2017) which presented how government of 
Uganda has over the years introduced a number of 
reforms aimed at enhancing transparency, accountability 
of public resources and improved service delivery. The 
findings render support to (Rabrenovic, 2009) who 
outlined service delivery as one the mechanisms that can 
ensure 
sound 
financial 
accountability. 
Based 
on 
European Union guidelines, Rabrenovic notes that the 
ability of the accounting entity to remain transparent and 
give evidence of value for money is dependent on the 
effectiveness of the internal controls in place to foretell 
budgetary problems before they occur.  
The findings seem to disagree with Auditor General 
(2017) whose report called for the need to ensure quality 
service delivery as well as citizen participation and 
involvement. The disagreement of the findings with 
Auditor general‟s report comes in as corrective evidence 
to the recommendations of the Auditor General‟s report of 
2017. Contrary to Auditor General‟s report, the current 
study presented Kabale district local government as 
delivering services that depict the right type and as 
meeting the demands of citizens. The findings is in 
agreement with Agwor and Akani (2017) who investigated 
financial 
accountability 
and 
performance 
of 
local 
governments in River State, Nigeria; and observed that 
local governments are assumed to be performing if the 
projects and services meet the demands of the citizens in 
the local areas.  
The findings indicated pessimistically that Kabale 
district local government solves the problems of citizens. 
This agrees with Keil (2005) who analyzed the principle-
agent theory and its application on outsourcing in 
software development. He found that the principles (who 
are the citizens in this case) fail to receives the goods 
and services they pay for because they are limited in 
ability to monitor and judge the input and output of the 
contractors (in this case the local government). Similarly, 
Hlavaeek and Hlavaeek (2006) who analyzed the 
“Principal – Agent” problem in the context of the 
economic survival found that the public empowers 
government officials to promote public welfare using 
public resources, however, government officials end up 
serving their own interests, which  jeopardizes  service  to  
Arinaitwe et al.           107 
 
 
 
the public. This is true in the sense that the public lacks 
the ability to question the conduct and behavior of 
government officials and to impose sanctions where such 
conduct or behaviors fall short of the requirement.  
The study presented the budget as the least used 
mechanism of financial accountability in the district. 
Participants disagreed that the budget enables council to 
attend to priorities in the local area. The findings agree 
with Tsurkan et al., (2016) who noted that financial 
accounting and management accounting cannot be 
neatly compartmentalized in the public sector, where 
management accounting refers to budgeting and control 
rather than accounting solely in the service of managers. 
Certainly, if the budget is an expression of political 
preference, service delivery will be compromised in favor 
of political interests. However, the findings disagree with 
Berner and Smith (2004) who view the budget as a 
mechanism for financial planning. In their view, the 
budget allows for the achievement of priorities and 
objectives through the limited fiscal resources. Treated in 
this angle, the budget can contribute significantly to 
greater efficiency, effectiveness and accountability within 
the organization. Participants also disagreed that they 
demonstrate community preference and that council 
utilizes resources economically. In this view, all public 
actions should embrace citizens‟ preference and work 
towards achieving it. The findings however, disagree with 
Kim et al. (2010) who noted that when various 
stakeholders 
combine 
information 
on 
budgeting 
preferences, the principle of publicity overrides all the 
core principles of any budget. Competing interests should 
be analyzed and prioritized democratically. 
 
 
CONCLUSION AND POLICY IMPLICATION 
 
The study examined financial accountability mechanisms 
in Kabale district local government, Uganda. Given the 
four financial accountability mechanisms investigated, 
service delivery is the most widely applied financial 
accountability 
mechanism 
in 
Kabale 
district 
local 
government. Given the current study, it is clear that most 
of the projects implemented in the district align with the 
demands of the local population and citizens‟ welfare, in 
particular. The study found that participants could 
evaluate the performance of the district in terms of 
service delivery because such services are visible to the 
public compared to financial reporting, expenditures and 
the 
budget, 
which 
require 
technical 
judgment. 
Notwithstanding the technical requirements to evaluate 
financial performance in terms of financial reporting, 
expenditure control, and the budget; this study found that 
the district achieves much of her budgetary goals under 
supplementary budget approvals. The budget was indeed 
the least measure of financial performance strongly 
because of the irregularities in salaries and wages 
expenditures, and its political preference. Therefore, local  

108          J. Account. Taxation 
 
 
 
governments should ensure their budgets demonstrate 
community preference, pay salaries and wages as 
approved in the budget, and standardize their reporting 
on liabilities. Due to the scope of this paper, which could 
not quantitatively relate financial accountability and 
service delivery, future researchers should consider 
assessing the effect of financial accountability on service 
delivery in local governments.
