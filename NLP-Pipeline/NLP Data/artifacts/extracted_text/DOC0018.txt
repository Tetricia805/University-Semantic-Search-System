CHAPTER ONE 
1.1 INTRODUCTION. 
The spread of social media platforms in recent years has completely changed how 
people interact and communicate. Instagram is the most popular of these, with 
over a billion users worldwide who use it every month. Instagram has certainly 
made it easier for people to express themselves and interact with others, but an 
increasing number of studies indicates that it may also have a negative impact on 
students' mental health, especially in learning environments. 
 
 
Research on the intricate connection between Instagram use and mental health is 
starting to emerge. A study conducted in 2017 by Primack et al. discovered a 
significant correlation between young adults' sense of social isolation and their 
usage of social media, particularly Instagram. Additionally, the platform's focus on 
carefully chosen photos and filtered representations of reality has been connected 
to elevated anxiety and depressive symptoms, as well as body image issues, 
especially in teenagers and young adults. 
This study aims to thoroughly examine the complex effects of Instagram on 
students' mental health. We seek to offer a comprehensive understanding of this 
urgent issue by exploring the ways in which the platform affects psychological 
well-being, encourages social comparison, and modifies self-perception. 
 
 
1.2 BACKGROUND. 
1.2.1. MEDIA AND MENTAL HEALTH. 
Social media platforms' explosive growth has completely changed how people 
engage with one another, communicate, and exchange information. According to a 
publication by Instagram (2022), Instagram has emerged as one of the most popular 
platforms 
due 
to 
its visually-driven content, especially among younger 
demographics. It's critical to recognize the possible effects 

2  
  
 
social media may have on students' mental health as it becomes more and more 
ingrained in their daily lives. 
 
1.2.2. Instagram and Social Comparison. 
The social comparison phenomenon is one of the main ways that Instagram may have 
an impact on mental health. The platform gives users a well-curated glimpse into 
other people's lives, frequently presenting romanticized portrayals of reality. 
Research has demonstrated that regular exposure to this kind of carefully chosen 
content can cause upward social comparison, in which people evaluate themselves 
against others and may feel inadequate or less valuable, according to Fardouly, J., 
et al. (2015) 
 
1.2.3Body Image Concerns and Instagram 
Instagram's focus on visual content, especially pictures of lifestyle and physical 
appearance, has been connected to increased body image concerns, particularly in 
teens and young adults, according to Tiggemann, M., et al. (2014) 
 
 
1.2.4. Instagram and Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) 
FOMO, or the fear of missing out, is a phenomenon that can be exacerbated by the 
constant barrage of updates and posts on Instagram. This is a reference to the fear 
that while one is away, others are enjoying fulfilling experiences. 
 
1.2.5. Isolation and Loneliness 
Overuse of Instagram has been linked to higher feelings of social isolation, which 
runs counter to the platform's stated goal of promoting social connections. 
According to a study by Primack et al. (2017), young adults' perceptions of social 
isolation were found to be elevated in correlation with higher use of social media, 
including Instagram. 

3  
  
 
1.2.6. Positive Aspects of Instagram 
It's crucial to remember that Instagram also provides beneficial opportunities for 
self- expression, creativity, and community building, even though a large portion 
of the research emphasizes possible drawbacks. In addition to sharing personal 
accomplishments and having insightful conversations, users can locate support 
networks. It is still difficult to find a balance between these advantages and any 
potential drawbacks. 
 
1.3 PROBLEM STATEMENT 
There are situations of students at Uganda Christian University suffering from 
mental instability as a result of avid consumption of Instagram content. However, no 
research has been done as to the nature of content consumed by students on 
Instagram, how it affects their mental well-being and the extent of mental 
suffering. 
 
 
1.4 PURPOSE OF STUDY 
The main purpose of this study is to identify students consuming Instagram content 
and analyze the nature of content and its effects on students mental well being and 
the consequential extent of mental suffering visited upon the students.

1.8 JUSTIFICATION OF STUDY 
1.8.1 Instagram's Pervasive Influence: Among young adults and students in 
particular, Instagram has grown to become one of the most widely used social media 
platforms worldwide. Because of its widespread use and impact on daily life, it is 
imperative to comprehend its potential effects on mental health. 

7  
  
 
 
1.8.2 Growing Concerns about Mental Health: As students deal with particular 
stressors and difficulties associated with academic demands, social dynamics, and 
the transition to adulthood, there is a growing concern about the mental health 
and well-being of students. Examining Instagram's function in this regard is 
pertinent and timely. 
 
 
1.8.4 Potential Benefits and Drawbacks: Instagram is a multifaceted platform that 
offers options for self-expression, community building, and artistic expression. It 
does, however, also carry some risk in terms of mental health issues, body image 
issues, and social comparison. The goal of this study is to investigate both 
advantages and disadvantages. 
 
 
1.8.5 Educational and Psychological Significance: Since school has a significant 
impact on students' lives, knowledge of how Instagram affects mental health can 
help develop interventions, guidelines, and other support systems. 
 
 
1.8.6 Relevance to Well-Being Initiatives: Student mental health and well-being are 
becoming more and more of a priority in Uganda Christian University . The 
development of focused interventions and educational initiatives targeted at 
encouraging responsible social media use and improving student wellbeing can be 
guided by the insights obtained from this study. 
 
 
1.8.7 Prevention of Potential Harm: It's important to recognize potential risk 
factors and protective factors because excessive or unhealthy Instagram use may 
have negative effects. The development of evidence-based mitigation strategies 
for potential harm can benefit from this study. 

8  
  
 
1.9 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY 
The results of this research are significant on several fronts; 
 
1.9.1 Addressing a Contemporary Concern: Given the increasing use of Instagram by 
young adults, particularly students, it is imperative to comprehend the possible 
effects of this platform on mental health, as noted by Primack, B. A., et al. (2017) 
and Twenge, J. M., et al. (2018). 
 
 
1.9.2 Adding to the Conversation on Mental Health: As stated by Odgers, C. L., et al. 
(2020) and Primack, B. A., et al. (2018). The study contributes to the expanding 
body of knowledge regarding the connection between social media use and 
outcomes related to mental health. It provides insights into a particular population 
within the UCU students that is especially vulnerable to mental health issues by 
concentrating on students. 
 
 
1.9.3 Informing Educational Practices: Schools have a significant impact on students' 
lives. Uganda Christian University can create supportive policies, interventions, 
and educational programs with insight into how Instagram affects their mental 
health . 
 
 
1.9.4 Guiding Social Media Use: It is becoming more and more crucial to provide 
evidence- based guidelines for social media use that is both mindful and healthy, 
especially with the rise in popularity of Instagram and other social media platforms. 
Recommendations for parents, teachers, and students can be influenced by this 
study. 
 
 
1.10 THE CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK OF THE STUDY 
This study was situated within the; 
Impact of Instagram on UCU students’ mental health, considering instagram usage 

9  
  
 
as the independent variable and mental health outcomes such as anxiety, 
depression, social- comparison and many more as the dependent variable. Social 
support, self-identity, and social 

10  
  
 
media literacy moderate this relationship, while social comparison, fear of missing 
out (FOMO), and cyberbullying mediate it. As guided by Uses and Gratifications 
theory, this framework examines how they learn behaviors and attitudes, fulfill 
specific needs, and navigate autonomy, competence and relatedness online, 
ultimately shinning light on the complex interaction between instagram and 
mental health among UCU students.

2.0 INTRODUCTION 
CHAPTER TWO 
LITERATURE REVIEW 
Social Media refers to “the websites and online tools that facilitate interactions 
between users by providing them opportunities to share information, opinions and 
interest”.( Swar and 
Hameed, 2017). People have various reasons for the use of social media which 
includes entertainment, communication, searching for information. Note that 
adolescents and young adults are spending an increasing amount of time on 
online networking sites, texting and other social media. Twenge and Campbell. 
(2019) 
Social media has altered the forms of group interaction and its users individual 
and collective behavior around the world. According to Swar et Al.2017, there are 
increased concerns regarding the possible negative impacts associated with social 
media usage addiction, this 
relates particularly on psychological well being. 
 
 
 
2.1 THE CONCEPT OF DEVELOPMENT 2.1.1Social 
Comparison and Self-Esteem 
Instagram is a visual content sharing platform that has been recognized as a major 
social comparison arena. According to Perloff, R. M. (2014), this could lead to 
upward social comparison, in which individuals assess themselves in light of 
idealized norms, which could impair one's self-esteem and make them feel 
inadequate 
 
 
2.1.2 Body Image Concerns and Eating Disorders 
As stated by Fardouly, J., et al. (2015) and Tiggemann, M., et al. (2014). Concerns 
regarding Instagram's influence on body image dissatisfaction and related 
psychological issues have been raised due to the platform's ubiquitous presence of 

12  
  
 
idealized body images. Several studies have 

13  
  
 
shown a link between exposure to these kinds of images on a regular basis and 
higher levels of body dissatisfaction, especially in young women. Furthermore, 
studies by Perloff, R. M. (2014) and Rodgers, R. F., et al. (2018) suggest that 
Instagram may play a role in the emergence of disordered eating behaviors as well 
as increased concerns about appearance and body weight 
 
 
2.1.3 Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) and Anxiety 
The fear that others are enjoying rewarding events or social interactions can lead 
to heightened anxiety and a sense of social exclusion, especially among students 
who may already be navigating complex social dynamics, according to Wegmann, 
E., Stodt, B., et al (2015) 
 
2.1.4 Depression and Loneliness 
Numerous research has investigated the connection between Instagram use and 
mental health consequences, specifically concentrating on feelings of depression 
and isolation. Primack et al. (2017) discovered a strong correlation between young 
adults' increased use of social media, particularly Instagram, and their increased 
sense of social isolation. Additional studies by Primack, B. A., Colditz, et al. (2018) 
and Vannucci, A., K. M., et al. (2017) have revealed a connection between 
frequent Instagram use and increased depressive symptoms, especially in teenagers 
 
 
 
2.1.5 Good Elements and Helping Neighbors 
Although Instagram has been shown to have detrimental effects on mental health, 
it's also critical to recognize the platform's possible benefits. In supportive 
communities, where they can exchange stories, look for guidance, and form deep 
connections, many users find comfort. Instagram gives people a platform to display 
their skills and interests while also encouraging self-expression and creative 
exploration. 

14  
  
 
2.1.6 Coping mechanisms and interventions 
Since Instagram is so common in students' lives, it is critical to think about 
intervention strategies to lessen any potential negative effects. Students can be 
better prepared to navigate Instagram and other social media platforms in a more 
psychologically resilient way by participating in educational programs and 
awareness campaigns about media literacy, healthy social media use, and self-
esteem building.

METHODOLOGY 
This section outlines the study’s research design, sampling, data collection 
methods and research tools. The section also presents process of data analysis and 
interpreting the data. 
 
 
The Research Design 
 3.1The case study Design 
Case Study Design: Investigating the Impact of Instagram on UCU Students Mental 
Health 
 
1. Title of the Case Study: 
 
"Through the Lens of Instagram: Exploring the Effects of Instagram on UCU Student 
Mental Health" 
 
 
2. Objectives: 
 
To investigate the connection between student mental health outcomes and 
Instagram use. 
 
To pinpoint the potentially influential elements of certain Instagram content, such 
as body image and social comparison. 
To investigate any possible advantages and coping techniques related to Instagram 
use. 
 
 
 
 

16  
  
 
3.1.1 Advantages of Case Studies: 
1. Rich, In-Depth Data: Case studies enable a thorough analysis of individual 
experiences, offering a profound comprehension of the intricacies surrounding 
Instagram's effect on mental health. Nuanced insights that quantitative methods 
might overlook can be revealed by this qualitative approach. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

17  
  
 
2. Contextual Understanding: Case studies give you the chance to investigate the 
phenomenon in its organic setting. This makes it possible for researchers to take into 
account more extensive social, cultural, and environmental elements that might 
have an impact on the connection between Instagram use and mental health. 
3. Investigation of Uncommon Cases: Case studies allow for the examination of 
uncommon or singular cases that might not be adequately represented in extensive 
polls or trials. This can reveal particular trends and situations that advance 
knowledge of the subject. 
4. Holistic Perspective: To obtain a complete picture of a person's experiences, 
perceptions, and behaviors linked to Instagram use and mental health, researchers 
can collect data from a variety of sources (such as questionnaires, journals, and 
interviews). 
5. Theory and Hypothesis Generation: Case studies can be used as a springboard to 
develop theories and hypotheses that can be investigated in more extensive, 
regulated research projects. They can offer insightful preliminary information for 
additional study. 
6. Ethical Considerations: When it comes to delicate subjects like mental health, 
case studies provide an opportunity to carefully examine ethical principles. By 
building a relationship with participants, researchers can make sure they are 
comfortable throughout the study. 
 
 
3.1.2 Disadvantages of Case Studies: 
 
Limited Generalizability: It might be difficult to extrapolate case study results to a 
broader population. It's possible that the particulars of the case and the setting 
don't accurately reflect larger patterns. 

18  
  
 
Potential for Bias: The analysis and conclusions of a case study may be influenced by 
the biases and interpretations of the researchers. The validity of the results may be 
impacted by the researcher's bias, which could be introduced by this subjectivity. 
 
 
Time- and Resource-Intensive: Case studies demand a significant time, energy, and 
resource commitment. It can take some time to find good cases, gather 
information, and carry out in- depth analysis. 
 
 
Difficulty in Replication: Case studies are frequently particular to the particular 
facts and participants. It can be difficult to duplicate the precise circumstances or 
locate comparable cases for comparison. 
 
 
Limited Control Over Variables: Case studies offer less control over unimportant 
variables than experimental designs do. Because of this, it could be more difficult 
to prove a link between Instagram use and positive effects on mental health. 
 
 
Subject to Subjectivity and Interpretation: Interpretation is a necessary part of 
analyzing qualitative data in case studies, and it can be impacted by the viewpoint 
of the researcher. The same data may be interpreted differently as a result of this 
subjectivity. 
 
 
 
It's critical that researchers carefully weigh these benefits and drawbacks before 
selecting a case study methodology to examine Instagram's effects on students' 
mental health. 
Furthermore, integrating case studies with additional research techniques can aid 
in offering a more thorough comprehension of the phenomenon. 

19  
  
 
 
 
3.2 The Qualitative Approach: 
Sample Size: 30-50 students from various courses with UCU representing a diverse 
demographic. 
 
 
Inclusion Criteria: Participants must be active Instagram users (defined as using the 
platform at least three times a week). 
Study Procedures: 
 
 
a. Recruitment: 
 
- Participants will be recruited through direct outreach which is word of mouth and 
a bit of social media announcements like in WhatsApp groups 
 
 
b. Informed Consent: 
 
- Participants will be provided with detailed information about the study, and their 
informed consent will be obtained. 
 
 
c. Baseline Assessment: 
 
- Participants will complete a pre-study questionnaire to gather demographic 
information, Instagram usage patterns, and baseline mental health measures (e.g., 
depression, anxiety scales). 
 
 
 

20  
  
 
3.3 Data Analysis: 
Qualitative data from the reflective questionnaire will be subjected to thematic 
analysis to identify recurring themes and patterns related to Instagram use. 
 
 
3.3 Ethical Considerations: 
Confidentiality and anonymity of participants will be strictly maintained. 
 
Participants will be reminded of their right to withdraw from the study at any 
point without consequence. 

21  
  
 
3.4 Limitations of the study 
The study relies on self-reported data, which may be subject to social desirability 
bias. Generalizability may be limited due to the specific demographic and Instagram 
usage criteria. 

22  
  
 
CHAPTER FOUR 
DATA INTERPRETATION & PRESENTATION OF RESULTS 
 
 
4.0 INTRODUCTION 
This chapter presents the findings from qualitative data analysis exploring the 
impact of Instagram on UCU student’s mental health. The chapter begins with 
a summary of the research questions and the qualitative methodology used, 
including details on participant selection, data collection methods (e.g semi-
structured interviews), and data analysis 
techniques (e.g. thematic analysis) 
 
 
 
4.1 THEMES AND PATTERNS 
Thematic analysis revealed several key themes related to the impact of 
Instagram on UCU students’ mental health. The following themes emerged from 
the data: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

23  
  
 
4.1.1 Social Comparison and Self-esteem: 
 
Many participants described feelings of peer pressure and lower self-esteem when 
comparing themselves to idealized images and lifestyles portrayed on Instagram. 
For example: Participant A stated, “Instagram affects me mentally every time I 
see how people dress and look so cool, I find myself feeling so low and it makes 
me doubt myself a lot.” 
 
 
4.1.2 Fear of Missing Out (FOMO): 
 
Participants expressed anxiety and stress when they felt out or disconnected 
from social events and updates posted by their peers on Instagram. 

24  
  
 
For example: Participant B stated, “I get really anxious if I don’t check instagram 
daily. It 
 
makes me want to try out new places just like other people so the pressure to move 
is there.” 
 
 
 
 
4.1.3. Hopelessness and Depression: 
 
Several participants reported experiences of being hopeless about how they 
look and dress because of the way their peers dress and the number of likes and 
followers they get on Instagram, which contributes to feelings of depression and 
anxiety. 
For example: Participant C shared, “I’ve lost all hope and self esteem due to the 
few likes I get on the app yet I think I dress well. I am thinking of avoiding the 
app for a while.” 
 
 
4.1.4. Opportunities: 
 
A couple of participants reported positive interactions with the app mostly 
highlighting Opportunities, which contributed to feelings of hope and 
entertainment. 
For example: Participant D stated, “I feel like Instagram boosts up my fashion 
sense, and opens up my mind with the help of conspiracy theories, the matrix 
basically.” Another Participant added, “Basing on the content I usually come 
across it always creates a positive mood such as watching motivational speeches 
and sometimes teaches me something new in my life.” 
 
 
4.2 INTEGRATION OF FINDINGS 

25  
  
 
The themes identified in the qualitative analysis provide a shade of how 
instagram use impacts UCU students mental Health. They highlight both 
positive such as social 
connectedness, opportunities, and negative aspects such as increased stress, 
pressure and negative self-perception

premises 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

27  
  
 
This respondent argued that as long as you can access a smart phone in UCU, you 
would definitely be able to consume instagram or have the app, they believe the 
two are inseparable like how can’t you have instagram 
 
 
Participant B- Argues that students that are open minded and curious about 
their environments and want to creatively enjoy their free time by looking at 
places people have visited on Instagram.

28  
  
 
This respondent argued and emphasized that there are many of them that 
consume Instagram content due to curiosity and having an open mind to different 
places that they would also want to visit and not necessarily compete with 
people. 
 
 
Participant C- Basically students in our age bracket which is 18-25 years of age 
who are actively on social media. 
 
 
This respondent argued that most of the people consuming Instagram content are 
teens and campuses majorly and those who have just started working who are social 
media active hence consuming Instagram. 
 
 
2. What is the nature of the content consumed by the students at Uganda 
Christian University? 
Participant A- Students majorly consume the Instagram posts because the 
picture quality doesn’t reduce as compared to WhatsApp or even Facebook so 
the content there is more of optical nutrition 
 
 
This respondent argued that how can’t you like the content on Instagram majorly 
the pictures posted by the pretty ladies and handsome men, so the respondent 
feels like people consume majorly the good quality posts. 
 
 
Participant B- definitely the funny Instagram reels that make my day so I feel 
the most consumed content on Instagram is the reels. 
The person argued that the reels are fun entertainment so if not the extremely 
funny reels, then what else would you definitely be going to Instagram for. 

29  
  
 
 
Participant C- The cognitive content which is for the open minded, some people 
like me go to Instagram to see the latest trends and get to learn new things from 
motivational speakers, this also depends on the people you follow 
 
 
3. How does the Instagram content consumed affect the student’s mental 
wellbeing? Participant A- The overrated content and posts from ladies with the 
worked-out bodies that look too prefect compared to the person scrolling through 
the posts can cause self-doubt. 
 
 
This respondent argued that content consumed by some students can create 
self-doubt and people can end up losing self-confidence because they believe 
they don’t look good. 
 
 
Participant B- The way people dress and look so cool make people, including me 
doubt the way I dress and look as well, makes me want to step up 
 
 
The respondent argued that it creates self-doubt of how someone presents 
themselves. 
 
 
Participant C- I get anxious when I don’t check instagram in a day, I must check 
what is happening I feel like people are leaving me behind so I must know 
everything by the end of the day. 
 
 
The respondent argued that the content creates anxiety within students, like 
someone reaches a point and they can’t live without checking instagram, its 
addictive. 

30  
  
 
5.2 FINDINGS VS LITERATURE REVIEW 
The following sub-section will discuss the relationship between the findings of 
this research and the Literature review. 
As previously discussed in the literature review many scholars agree that Instagram 
is a visual content sharing platform that creates concerns regarding influence on 
body image 
Dissatisfaction, fear that others are enjoying rewarding events or social exclusion. 
Numerous research has investigated the connection between Instagram use and 
mental health consequences, specifically concentrating on feelings of depression 
and isolation. (Primack et al. 2017). Although Instagram has been shown to have 
detrimental effects on mental health, it’s also critical to recognize the platforms 
possible benefits. It’s so common in stents lives. 
 
 
Participant A 
 
This respondent agrees with the literature review that Instagram is a visual 
content sharing platform that has effects on mental health for example causing 
self-doubt because of how people dress or appear on the social app hence low 
self-esteem and confidence. 
 
 
Participant B 
 
This particular respondent argued that Instagram actually causes feelings of 
depression and isolation so they totally agree with the literature review presented. 
 
 
Participant C 
 
This respondent points out that Instagram not only has negative effects on 
human mental health but also has the positive side for example it’s a source of 
inspirational talks to those that follow the right people hence a positive mental 
build or progress. 

31  
  
 
5.3 UNEXPECTED RESULTS 
In this case, I didn’t expect to find any positive thought from students because 
despite the negative responses from the people interviewed, after giving a 
negative thought on the visual platform, they would give a positive one too where 
by many put out the point of opportunities. The opportunity to create content to 
entertain people or the opportunity to meet new people or be able to get 
inspirational quotes or info from the platform. Furthermore I didn’t expect to get 
the answer of how helpful it is to find out new places, okay yes, that is true but 
the side effect of that is comparing yourself to the people out there having fun 
and losing confidence. But to my surprise some people are actually really strong 
when it comes to social media life and can’t be mentally put down.

CHAPTER SIX 
CONCLUSION 
 
6.0 SUMMARY OF FINDINGS 
The qualitative analysis revealed that Instagram use influences students’ mental 
health through various mechanisms, including social comparison, fear of missing 
out, hopelessness and depression and Opportunities. 
 
 
6.1 DISCUSSION OF FINDINGS 
The findings underscore the complex nature of Instagram’s impact on UCU 
students’ mental health, indicating that while it can facilitate social connections, 
opportunities and self- expression, it also poses risks to psychological well-being, 
particularly among vulnerable individuals. The identified themes align with 
existing literature on social media and mental health, emphasizing the need for 
targeted interventions and support strategies. 
 
 
6.2 THEORETICAL IMPLICATIONS 
From a theoretical perspective, the findings contribute to understanding how 
social media platforms like Instagram shape individual’s perceptions of 
themselves and others. They suggest that theoretical frameworks such as social 
cognitive theory of mass communication are relevant for explaining the observed 
impacts. 
 
 
 
6.3 PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS 
Practically, the study highlights the importance of promoting digital literacy and 
resilience among students to navigate the challenges posed by social media. 
Educational institutions and mental health professionals should develop 
interventions that address both the positive 

33  
  
 
and negative aspects of Instagram use, fostering healthy online behaviors and 
providing support for those experiencing mental health issues worsened by 
social media. 
 
 
6.4 LIMITATIONS 
Limitations of the study include the small size and potential biases inherent in 
qualitative research for example participant self-selection. Future research 
could benefit from larger, more diverse samples and longitudinal designs to 
further explore the long-term effects of Instagram use on mental health. 
 
 
6.5 FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS 
Future research could explore how different types of social media platforms for 
example Twitter, Tik Tok, how they influence mental health outcomes among 
students. Additionally, comparative studies could investigate cultural variations in 
the impact of Instagram on mental health and examine effective strategies for 
mitigating negative effects.
