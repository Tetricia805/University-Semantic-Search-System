ABSTRACT 
 
This research aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of integrating hydrated lime 
(HL) as an additive to enhance workability properties of granite stone dust (GSD)-
modified asphalt mixes, due to the particle angularity and roughness of GSD and its 
inability to effectively interact with the binder. The study utilized hydrated lime 
to substitute GSD at 0%, 1%, 2%, 3%, and 4% by weight of aggregates. A series of 
laboratory tests—Marshall Stability, Marshall Flow, Bulk density, Air voids, Indirect 
Tensile Strength (ITS)—were used to evaluate workability properties. Notably, the 
3% hydrated lime demonstrated the best performance, denoted by the maximum 
Marshall Stability of 16.7 kN, best Flow of 3.6 mm, maximum Bulk density of 2.344 
g/cm³, and best moisture resistance with a TSR of 96%. It is evident that the use of 
3% hydrated lime improves the workability of GSD asphalt for low-volume road 
constructions in tropical environments such as Uganda.

CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION 
1.0 Introduction 
1.1 Background 
In the Lweeza community, road construction integrated granite stone dust as a 
filler in asphalt mixtures, which filled the voids in the asphalt, densifying the 
mixture and reducing moisture infiltration. Because of its high thermal capacity, it 
was also useful in high temperature conditions as it mitigated rutting (Jwaida et 
al., 2024). While this approach improved pavement performance, the workability 
of the granite stone dust was negatively affected. (Ochen, 2024).  
1.2 Problem Statement 
Roads in the Lweeza community that use GSD-modified asphalt have experienced 
this premature deterioration, even within the planned design life. Pavement 
failures such as ravelling, stripping, cracking, and pothole formation negatively 
affected the durability of the road. Despite proper drainage systems in place, a 
lack of rutting (indicating heavy traffic loads), and being that it was situated in a 
residential area where the access road was not in proximity to any swamps 
(indicating moisture infiltration due to capillary action). While stop-and-go traffic 
was indeed a source of mechanical wear and tear on the road, it accelerated 
pavement failure. The road was a low-traffic volume access road, and was still 
within its design life, implying that it should still be withstanding the traffic 
loading that it was designed for, for the duration of its design life. These defects 
are largely attributed to poor compaction and uneven binder coating due to the 
stiff and segregated nature of granite stone dust-modified mixtures. The resulting 
lower densities significantly compromised pavement durability and lifespan. The 
angularity and texture of granite stone dust led to reduced workability, making 
mixing, compaction, and application more difficult. 

2 
 
The primary issue revolved around the fact that GSD mixes are stiff, segregation-
prone, and hardly workable, thus affecting the mixing, laying, and compacting 
processes, which eventually influenced the observed distress of the pavement. This 
process translated to lower densities, lower pavement life, and higher 
maintenance costs. 
Although the early failure of the pavement could be attributed to the 
workmanship, the above consideration ignores the material science constraint 
imposed by the mixture, causing the inherent workability issues. The granite stone 
dust caused workability issues due to the high internal friction due to the high 
angularity, the presence of siliceous material that reduced the affinity for the 
binder, and the rough texture that reduced the aggregate and binder bond. This 
required additional compactive force for the creation of a homogenous, pliable, 
and compact asphalt mixture. That can be applied on the road. The use of the 
granite stone dust created a ceiling on achievable densities and coating quality, 
making the best aggregate-binder adhesion and compaction difficult to achieve 
even with good field practice. Consequently, failures like ravelling and stripping 
that accelerated pavement failures are the inevitable outcome of using a filler 
whose properties naturally resist effective mixing and compaction. This study 
seeks to address the workability challenges of the GSD-modified asphalt in order to 
retain its benefits as a sustainable construction material with high thermal 
capacity (preventing rutting) while improving its binder-aggregate adhesion and 
compact-ability in order to engineer a more workable, durable, water-resistant 
pavement for reliable, sustainable construction.  
Hydrated lime has been studied extensively and proven to be an effective anti-
stripping agent. It reduces the plasticity of fine aggregates, and it chemically 

3 
 
bonds the binder and the aggregates, enhancing adhesion. The purpose of this 
research, therefore, was to evaluate the effect of the hydrated lime on the 
workability of the asphalt. (Han et al, 2019) 
However, it’s potential to combat the workability issues posed by GSD-modified 
asphalt—particularly in Uganda's tropical environment was still unexplored. This 
research, therefore, aims to evaluate the effect of hydrated lime on the 
workability of GSD-modified asphalt mixtures 
1.3 Research Objectives 
This study aims to evaluate the effect of hydrated lime on the workability of GSD-
modified asphalt mixtures. The specific objectives are: 
1. To Determine Physical and chemical Properties of Hydrated Lime in Relation 
to its Role as a Filler in Asphalt Concrete 
2. To determine the optimal content of hydrated lime to be used in granite 
stone dust modified asphalt mixture  
3. To assess the workability of the GSD- asphalt with the integration of 
hydrated lime and without it 
4. To develop a modified mix design specification for the GSD-Hydrated Lime 
Asphalt mixture  
1.4 Research Questions 
1. What physical and chemical properties of hydrated lime influence its use as a 
filler in granite stone dust (GSD)-modified asphalt mixtures? 
 2. How does varying the proportion of hydrated lime influence the workability of 
GSD-modified asphalt mixtures?  
3. What was the optimum hydrated lime content in GSD-modified asphalt to 
achieve a balance of workability and structural performance?  

4 
 
4. How does adding hydrated lime affect binder coating, compaction efficiency, 
and Moisture resistance in granite stone dust asphalt mixtures? 
1.5. Scope 
This research focuses on: 
Geographical Scope: An access road in Lweeza (Lat: N 0°13'25.19184"; Long: E 
32°33'17.85636"). 
Technical Scope: Laboratory-based evaluation of lime-modified GSD asphalt using 
Marshall Flow, Bulk Density, and Boiling Tests. 
1.6 Justification 
This study intends to improve road construction by integrating hydrated lime, 
resulting in reduced construction costs and sustainable construction by utilising a 
waste product. Hydrated lime increases the workability of asphalt concrete with 
granite stone dust by changing the fines-binder interactions.  This was the first 
study to investigate the lime-granite stone dust synergy in Uganda’s tropical 
climates, and will provide Uganda’s Ministry of Works with evidence-based 
hydrated lime performance data and dosage guidelines.   
Hydrated lime Improves Binder-Aggregate Adhesion by forming strong chemical 
bonds at the binder-aggregate interface, reducing stripping and Moisture 
susceptibility (Han et al, 2019). Hydrated lime mitigates this by decreasing the 
flexibility of particles, increasing the mix's compatibility. It improves the binder's 
cohesiveness and flow qualities by reducing the stiffening effect caused by angular 
particles like granite stone dust by lubricating contact points and reducing friction, 
making the asphalt mix easier to work with and compact during construction. 
(Little and Epps, 2006) Finally, by neutralizing acids, lime slows the oxidative aging 
of asphalt, extending pavement life and improving durability.

1.7 Significance of the Study 
This study appears important as it tackles an important problem that persists in 
the road construction industry, particularly for the people of the Lweeza 
community and the entire country of Uganda, as well as for tropical climates, 
concerning the early deterioration of roads that was ascribed to the poor 
workability of granite stone dust (GSD)-modified asphalt mixtures. This study 
proposes to improve the mixing, compaction, and binding capacity of asphalt to 
ensure the development of stronger roads. From the study, there are expectations 
for the development of scientifically based guidelines for the optimal content of 
GSD-modified asphalt mixtures that contain hydrated lime, ensuring that engineers 
and policy makers are equipped to improve the nature of the roads, as well as 
decrease maintenance costs. This study therefore provides support for the 
development of safe and strong roads for communities, as it would benefit the 
people and improve the development of the growing community, such as the one 
experienced by the people of Lweeza. This study scientifically fills the knowledge 
gap that exists regarding the relationship between GSD and the effect of high 
temperatures that are experienced in tropical climates, as there are very few 
scholarly articles and research on such topics. This study improves the 
comprehension of the influence of the addition of GSD and high temperatures on 
the nature of the physical and chemical properties of GSD-modified asphalt 
mixture. 
1.8 Conceptual framework 
This research investigates the influence of the use of hydrated lime on the 
workability and longevity of asphalt mixtures modified with granite stone dust 
(GSD) as used in Uganda. While the use of hydrated lime enhances the binding 
properties and resistance to damage by water of asphalt mixtures through the 

6 
 
chemical component, granite stone dust, which was produced during the granite 
processing process, consists of jagged, coarse grains that promote the hardening of 
the asphalt mixture and lower workability. In essence, workability of an asphalt 
mixture denotes the ease of mixing, transport, spreading, and compaction into the 
desired, compact surface. This factor, which ascertains the proper coating and 
compaction of the mixture, stands as the backbone for the longevity of the 
asphalt. The jagged nature, as well as the grain size, of the GSD particles limits 
the workability of the GSD-modified asphalts. 
Adding hydrated lime to GSD-modified asphalt makes it more workable due to the 
interaction between the lime and the aggregates and the binder, which makes the 
particles less stiff and lubricates the contact points. This reduces internal friction, 
making the material more compactable, which then gives it higher densities and 
strength without affecting the natural properties of granite stone dust. The study 
seeks to 
1. Characterization of the physical and chemical characteristics of hydrated lime 
as it applies to asphalt mixtures. 
2. To optimize the amount of hydrated lime required for realizing high workability 
without affecting the strength. 
3. Assessment and comparison of the workability and durability of asphalt mixtures 
with and without the use of hydrated lime in the tropical climate of Uganda. 4. 
Developing the design for the GSD-hydrated lime asphalt mixture. The general 
framework offers effective guidelines for the use of hydrated lime to increase the 
durability and cost-effectiveness of asphalt pavements during the process of their 
construction for local roads.

CHAPTER TWO: LITERATURE REVIEW 
2.0 Literature Review 
The aggregate base materials, especially the fillers, play an important role in 
determining the performance of the asphalt pavements. Nonetheless, granite stone 
dust, which has acted as the filler material in Uganda based on the availability and 
performance characteristics, has shown some negative effects regarding the 
workability of the asphalt mixture. More recent research work has, therefore, 
focused on the use of additives, such as lime, as one of the alternatives for 
enhancing the workability and performance. This literature study reviews the 
available knowledge regarding the use of granite dust as the filler material, as well 
as the degree to which lime has proved effective. 
2.1 Granite Stone Dust in Asphalt 
The Granite Stone dust is the by-product of the granite industry. The rut 
resistance, the rigidity and the water resistance of the road are better with the 
use of granite stone despite the nature of the stone dust, that is to say the 
angularity and roughness (De Medeiros et al., 2023; Jwaida et al., 2024; Oesman et 
al., 2021). Regardless of these advantages, the shape of particles and the high 
internal interlock of the stone dust in the asphalt composite restrict the mix-
ability of the mixture and results in the inherent mixing, compaction and 
application difficulties. Bessa and others (2015) elaborated that mineral powder 
and powder content shape affect the compaction and thus usually cause the 
segregation and variations in density when laying the final surface.  
 

8 
 
2.2 Granite Stone Dust Workability Challenges 
Although GSD offers various benefits, it experiences some workability problems as 
a result of its angles and rough surface. Workability can be explained as the ease 
of mixing, transporting, spreading, and compaction of asphalt. For granite dust-
modified mixes, the high internal friction and absorption properties of the GSD 
limit the flexibility of the mixture, making compaction processes more difficult 
and prone to early failure. The higher absorption properties of GSD compared to 
the smoothed fillers increase internal friction and deterioration, making it difficult 
for the mixture to be well compacted, leading to low density and high early failure 
rates, such as stripping, ravelling, and the development of potholes (Ochen, 2024). 
Gudimettla, Murali, and Tharaghini (2004) explained that the workability problems 
can result in the development of an imbalanced binder coating, which enhances 
segregation and the development of the structure’s defect. In addition, the use of 
GSD experiences drawbacks regarding the design performance. Studies show that 
no more than 3% of GSD can be well utilized in the design of some asphalt 
mixtures, compared to 7.5% for cement fillers (Oesmanet al., & Benny, 2021) 
2.3 Hydrated Lime Effect on Asphalt Mixtures 
Hydrated lime has shown enhanced performance characteristics for the asphalt 
mixture. This was because it promotes aggregate and binder adhesion as a result of 
the formation of strong chemical bonds with the components of the bitumen, 
hence calcium soap, which promotes binding and coating (Han et al., 2019). 
Moreover, it acts as a plastic modifier, softening the particles in the mixture and 
making it easier to compact, ensuring that the mixture was cohesive (Little & 
Epps, 2006). Hydrated lime also works as an anti-stripping agent, neutralizing the 
acidic components of the bitumen, hence enhancing resistance to stripping (ASTM 
D7173). 

9 
 
There exists research proving the efficacy of the addition of hydrated lime to 
asphalt mixtures. According to Han et al. (2019), "Lime addition can enhance the 
polar component of the surface free energy (SFE) of the asphalt binder and 
improve the wetting and binding interaction between the asphalt binder and 
aggregates.” In regard to reduced compaction efforts, the study by Little and Epps 
(2006) proved that the addition of lime to the asphalt mixture reduces compaction 
efforts by 20%, thus allowing for faster and denser compaction. De Medeiros et al. 
(2023) proved that the use of lime satisfies the complete substitution of the 
conventional fillers, up to 100%, while maintaining the same levels of mechanical 
strength but certainly increasing workability and environmental sustainability. In 
Uganda, the average annual temperature, which varies from 20 – 28°C, intensifies 
the stiffening effect of the granular material, especially if the material was 
subjected to dry climatic conditions, thus making the workability process an 
integral priority for improvement. As a hydrate, lime carries a high lubrication 
capacity, as it reduces the particles' interaction and thus enhances the process of 
compaction. According to the research by Denis (2024), “Lubrication reduces 
compaction resistance and makes compaction easier.” In addition, lime helps to 
overcome the challenge of oxidative aging, thus making the material less reactive 
and, therefore, less harmful to the environment. As presented in the study by 
Little and Epps (2006), "Lime reduces the potential for oxidative aging and protects 
the asphalt binder against reactive acidic compounds, which makes the material 
especially effective for use and durable performance, especially in hot and tropical 
climates.” Although the lime increases the binding capacity between the binder 
and aggregate, the effect of the lime on the viscosity of the bitumen requires 
careful consideration. Several research works (for instance, Han et al. 2019, and 

10 
 
Little & Epps, 2006) suggest that the lime content can increase the binder viscosity 
through the generation of calcium and organic compounds and absorption of light 
fractions. This factor can enhance the cohesion of the mixture but limit 
workability if the lime content becomes excessive. This study, therefore, carries 
out an elaborate assessment of the workability of the mixture using various lime 
concentrations to ascertain the optimal content that presents the most benefits 
without undermining the workability. 
2.4 Optimum content of Granite Stone Dust 
In the experiment, the industrial waste obtained from granite stone production, 
which came as dust, was utilized as filling material present in the AC-WC mixture. 
The amount of filling material used varies from 3%, 4.5%, 6%, 7.5%, 9%, based on 
the comparison using cement filler. The experiment involved the use of wheel 
tracking equipment designed to operate at 60°C, 45°C, and 30°C. Results obtained 
from the experiment indicate that 3% Granite dust was the best content for the 
filling mixture of the AC-WC mixture. (Oesman et al., 2021) 
 
 
 
 
 
 

11 
 
Figure 1: The dynamic stability values of asphalt concrete 
 
The diagram indicates that the link between dynamic stability and filler content 
was not linear, nor was the type of filler. In general, asphalt concrete with cement 
filler was more stable than asphalt concrete with granite filler. The use of a 7.5% 
cement filler results in the maximum dynamic stability rating, 2520.0 passing/mm. 
Meanwhile, asphalt concrete with 3% granite filler content attained the maximum 
dynamic stability value, 1465.1 passing/mm, surpassing that of cement filler of the 
same degree (1400 passing/mm). 
Figure 2: The depth of deformation on the pavement at 60⁰C. 

12 
 
 The graphic indicates that the deformation depth was not proportional to the 
filler content or kind. The smallest deformation (2.01 mm) in cement-filled 
pavement occurs at a filler level of 7.5%. On the granite filler pavement, the 
smallest distortion (2.42 mm) occurs at 3% filler content. 
 
Figure 3: The deformation velocity of asphalt concrete 
 
The diagram indicates that the relationship between deformation velocity and 
filler content was not linear, nor is the type of filler. The smallest deformation 
speed (0.0167 min/mm) was seen in asphalt concrete with cement filler with a 
filler percentage of 7.5%. The asphalt concrete with the granite filler variation had 
the smallest deformation velocity (0.0287 min/mm) at the 3% filler level. As the 
speed of deformation decreases, the value of dynamic stability increases, implying 
that the depth of deformation decreases. 

13 
 
 
 
Figure 4: Dynamic stability and granite filling content 
 
The picture indicates that when the temperature rises, the value of dynamic 
stability on the pavement decreases. The loss in dynamic stability was related to 
the asphalt's great sensitivity to temperature changes. 
(Tiwari, Satyam &Miani, 2022) investigated the integration of MW as a filler at 
4.5%, 5.5%, 7%, and 8.5% by weight in hot mix asphalt. The altered mixtures met 
the requirements for abrasion, moisture damage, and Marshall Stability tests.  
(Khan et al, 2023) did a similar investigation on the use of MW as a filler in hot mix 
asphalt, investigating filler amounts ranging from 0 to 6 wt. % of aggregates. The 
Marshall method (by impact) was used for dosing, which may not adequately 
reflect field rolling compaction conditions. With the limestone aggregates in the 
combinations, 4% MW was determined to be the optimal level. However, when the 
amount of filler (marble powder) in the asphalt mixture grew, the fatigue life 
decreased. De Medeiros et al. evaluated the feasibility of partially and totally 
replacing filler in hot asphalt mixtures with waste from the granite and marble 

14 
 
industries. The commonly used filler, hydrated lime, was replaced with residue in 
proportions of 50% and 100% by weight. The results revealed that, as compared to 
the reference combination (having 0% residue), the asphalt mixture compromising 
waste marble and granite performed somewhat better mechanically. This was 
demonstrated by the lower ratio of the Resilient Modulus (RM) and Tensile Strength 
(TS), as depicted. 
Figure 5: Resilient Modulus and Tensile Strength 
 
2.5 Conclusion 
-The higher the temperature on the pavement, will cause the value of dynamic 
stability to decrease.  
- The use of cement filler with 7.5% content reaches the highest dynamic stability 
value, ie, 2520.0 passing/mm. Meanwhile, asphalt concrete with granite filler with 
3% filler content reached 1465.1passing / mm.  
- On asphalt concrete with variation of cement filler content, the smallest 
deformation (2.01 mm) occurs at 7.5% filler level. While on asphalt concrete with a 
variation of granite filler content, the smallest deformation (2.42 mm) occurred at 
3% filler content.  
-The smallest deformation speed (0.0167 min/mm) occurs in asphalt concrete with 
cement filler, at 7.5% filler content. While the asphalt concrete with the granite 
filler variation of the smallest deformation velocity (0.0287 min/mm) at 3% filler 
content.

adequately reflect field rolling compaction conditions. With the limestone 
aggregates in the combinations, 4% MW was determined to be the optimal level.

2.7 Research Gap 
Despite considerable global research, local data are scarce on the performance of 
lime-GSD asphalt mixtures in Uganda and other tropical countries. The majority of 
empirical studies are from temperate regions, which limits their relevance in East 

16 
 
Africa.  There was also a need for practical dose standards that are specific to 
local materials and construction techniques. Without these, the use of lime-GSD 
technology in community-level projects remains hampered. Despite, it being more 
cost-effective and sustainable.  
Although granite stone dust can enhance the mechanical behaviour of asphalt, it 
was prone to make workability difficult owing to its nature. Hydrated lime, on the 
other hand, offers a practical solution to improve adhesion, reduce plasticity, and 
enhance resistance to moisture. Several studies have documented how lime can 
facilitate compaction, enhance the binder coating, and increase the durability of 
asphalt mixes containing GSD. There are, however, significant gaps in our 
understanding of the behaviour of this mixture under Ugandan-specific climate and 
material conditions.

CHAPTER THREE: METHODOLOGY 
3.0 Research Methodology 
This chapter explores the process and approach that are going to be utilized to 
investigate the influence of the effect of hydrated lime on the workability of 
granite stone dust (GSD)-modified asphalt mixtures. The study adopted an 
experimental approach, involving laboratory testing for the evaluation of the 
material and the construction of asphalt mixtures, and to examine workability-
related characteristics. This method was structured in relation to the objectives of 
the study, the characterisation of hydrated lime and the search for the most 
optimal method for producing its dosage, and comparing the workability of asphalt 
mixtures with and without hydrated lime. 
This study adopted the design of comparative laboratory experiments. Two groups 
of asphalt mixtures were prepared, one using granite stone dust as the only 
aggregate and the other using a mixture of granite stone dust and progressively 
greater amounts of hydrated lime. The research was divided into three primary 
stages: 
1. Material characterisation 
2. Marshall mix design and hydrated lime content optimization 
3. Workability testing and comparative analysis. 
4. Development of a usable Marshall Mix Design 
3.1 Materials and Equipment 
The main materials to be employed in the research are:  
1. Asphalt Binder (Penetration Grade 60/70)  
2. Granite stone dust (GSD), derived from local quarries  
3.  Hydrated lime, from Tororo Cement  
4. ASTM C33 specified coarse and fine aggregates.  

18 
 
To guarantee compliance with applicable requirements, all materials were air-
dried, sieved to the required grade, and tested before use.  
3.2 Laboratory Testing 
Objective 1: Characterization of Hydrated Lime.  
To analyse the physical and chemical properties of hydrated lime relevant to its 
behaviour as filler, the following experiments were performed:  
Physical Properties 
1. Fineness (Particle Size Distribution): To determine the particle size 
distribution the use of a dry sieve analysis method according to ASTM C110. 
Finer particles of lime promoted the packing density of the asphalt mix and 
enhanced the interaction of the binder and the aggregates leading to lower 
air voids and improving the workability. 
2. Moisture Content: In order to prevent cracking during storage we determine 
the moisture content by the means of oven-dry method (ASTM C25), to make 
sure that the moisture content did not exceed 2%.  
3. Bulk Density and Specific Gravity: The density values are crucial for 
volumetric calculations for the mix design. The standards were required to 
be 400-600 kg/m3 and 2.2-2.4 respectively.  
Chemical Properties 
Calcium Hydroxide Content (Ca (OH)2 Purity: The high purity is necessary for the 
neutralization of the acidic components and enhance better coating at the binder 
aggregate interface. We used acid-base titration to test for a purity (>90%) as per 
ASTM C25. 

19 
 
Minor Oxides (MgO and CaO): These two oxides play a crucial role in the asphalt 
mastic. The MgO influences soundness and the CaO influences Alkalinity. Utilized 
an XRF (ASTM C 25).  
Objective 2: Determine the Optimal Hydrated Lime Content.  
The approach for determining the most effective amount of hydrated lime in GSD-
modified asphalt was as follows:  
1. Marshall Mix Design: Asphalt specimens were created in accordance with 
ASTM D6926 specifications. Multiple batches were prepared, with 0%, 1%, 
2%, 3%, and 4% hydrated lime substituting some of the GSD by weight. The 
optimum binder content (OBC) was determined for the control mixture using 
standard Marshall Stability and Flow analysis. 
2. The optimum hydrated lime content was determined for each mixture using 
Marshall Stability and Flow analysis, as well as Bulk Density.  
3.  Preliminary Workability tests: To evaluate the ease of mixing, compaction, 
and handling, we performed a Marshall Flow, Stability, and the bulk density 
(Saturated Surface Dry Method),  
4. Selection Criteria: The dosage with the best mix of workability and 
structural performance (stability, flow, and density) were deemed ideal. 
Objective 3: Assessment of Workability.  
Asphalt is a composite material; therefore, its workability is a composite property 
rather than a single measurable characteristic, like specific gravity. Instead, it’s a 
combination of a number of components that come together to give the asphalt 
composite its workability. That is to say, workability addressed the components of 
the composites ‘ease of mix-ability, compact-ability, and applicability. Therefore, 

20 
 
a combination of tests was necessary to properly assess each characteristic to 
collectively assess the workability of the asphalt mixture.  
 The workability of asphalt mixtures—with and without hydrated lime—were tested 
using the following standard tests:  
1. The Marshall Flow Test (ASTM D6927) measured the deformation of asphalt 
under load. Higher flow numbers typically suggest improved workability. 
That is the sample’s vertical deformation at the peak load point. It gauged 
the mix’s flexibility or plastic deformation. This was a direct indicator of 
workability. A mixture with a higher flow value was less stiff and more 
pliable, making it easier to compact and apply within the field without 
leading to segregation. The mix was brittle and stiff (poor workability) if the 
flow was very low. It was too plastic and prone to rutting if the flow was 
extremely high. 
2.  The Bulk Density Test (Saturated Surface Dry Method) determined compact-
ability by measuring the density of the compacted material. The density of 
a compacted asphalt sample can be determined with great accuracy using 
this test. Three conditions are used to weigh the sample: dry, immersed in 
water, and saturated (surface-dry). We computed its volume and density 
using these weights. Compact-ability was the outcome of workability, and 
density was the gold standard for this. Every sample in the lab was 
compressed with precisely the same amount of energy (75 Marshall Hammer 
blows). By definition, a mix was more workable if it reached a higher 
density than another with the same compaction effort.  
 

21 
 
3.3 Materials and Sample Preparation 
1.  Asphalt Binder: A penetration grade asphalt binder that was compliant with 
ASTM D5 (Standard Penetration of Bituminous Materials Test Method)was sourced 
from the supplier to bring about consistency. The properties of the binder are 
instrumental in defining mixture behaviour. The binder was placed in temperature-
controlled containers that are sealed at about 25 °C, as a precaution to inhibit 
aging. It was conditioned before the test, correct testing temperature (e.g.,60 °C) 
according to ASTM D36 (Standard Test Method for Softening Point). 
2. Aggregates: Granite Stone Dust (GSD) was collected from the local quarries 
within Lweeza. It was important that it was representative of the real material 
that was used in the local pavement layers. The mineral composition and particle 
size distribution were checked. Standard coarse and finely aggregated materials 
were sourced with certified suppliers, in line with ASTM C33 (Standard 
Specification of Concrete Aggregates). Aggregates were dried in an oven at all-
time sat a temperature greater than 105°for at least 24 hours to dry off Moisture, 
which may cause changes in mix properties.(ASTM C127, ASTM C128). 
3. Hydrated Lime: Hydrated lime [Ca(OH)2] of commercial grade were obtained at 
Tororo Cement and made according to the ASTM C110 specifications. The material 
dried in the oven at 105°C to remove any existing Moisture and then sieved with a 
.200 sieve (75 um) to assure uniformity of size of the particles. This fine particle 
size was critical to the successful sealing of pores between aggregates and 
enhancing mix density. 
 
 

22 
 
3.4 Material Characterization 
3.4.1 Asphalt Binder Testing 
Penetration Test (ASTM D5): The test was used to determine the consistency or the 
hardness of the Bitumen through the distance that a typical needle goes into a 
binder vertically sample. 
Softening Point Test (ASTM D36): To establish the temperature at which Bitumen 
has a specific level of softness, which implies that it was vulnerable to 
temperature changes at which it passes between semi-solid and viscous liquid 
state. 
Specific Gravity (ASTM D70): This will measure the density of the Bitumen, in 
comparison with water.  
3.5 Aggregate Testing 
1. Gradation Analysis: Sieve analysis in accordance with ASTM C136  
2. Flakiness Index (FI): The shape and the elongation of the aggregate affects 
compaction. We Measured according to ASTM C136. 
3. Specific gravity via ASTM C127. 
4. Water absorption via ASTM C128, which was significant in assessing the 
Moisture-related durability issues. 
3.6 Mixture Design and Preparation 
The asphalt mix was designed based on the Marshall method (ASTM D1559) to 
establishing optimum binder content. We had a control mix and Modified mix. 
The control mix had no GSD and the Modified mix had hydrated lime of 
changing percentages. 
Specimen Preparation 
1. Heating: Blend the constituents at the right temperatures in order to 
guarantee proper coating and workability. 

23 
 
2. Mixing: Combination of hydrated lime and GSD were mixed with aggregate 
materials on a dry basis with the addition of binder to provide the uniform 
distribution. 
3. Compaction: Marshal Compactor should be used to form target air voids and 
specimens density as per specification to ASTM D1559. 
4. Curing: Room temperature (~25 C) conditioning of cooled specimens will 
take place at room temperature hours before testing in order to ascertain 
performance. 
3.7 Testing Procedures 
Workability Assessment 
1. Flow and Consistency: The value of the flow that is realized in the process of 
compaction measured in millimetres was used as a measure of workability. The 
lower and higher flow values are the differences in the plasticity of the mixture 
and the ease with which it can be compacted (Asthana et al., 2015) 
2. Compaction Effort: The number of blows to achieve the desired density in 
making the specimen was taken as an indirect measure of workability. 
3.8 Quality Control and Validation 
1. Each experiment was done thrice according to ASTM E691.   
2. The equipment was also calibrated on a regular basis.   
3. There were detailed records of processes, observations and variations during 
the experiment. 
3.9 Work Plan/ Timeline 
The study took approximately 8 months and was split into the following significant 
stages; proposal defence, material collection, mix design and lab testing, analysis 
of data, and report writing. The initial month was used to construct the research 
hypothesis, carry out review of literature, and writing the proposal to be 

24 
 
approved. This was preceded by the purchase and manufacture of materials like 
the dust of granite stones, hydrated lime, and bitumen. Testing took a few weeks 
and it involved physical and chemical characterization of hydrated lime, Marshall 
Mix design formulation, and test of workability. These procedures were conducted 
according to ASTM and AASHTO standards, which guaranteed validity. The data 
gathered during the experimental stage were analysed, interpreted, and 
presented.

CHAPTER FOUR: RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
4.0 Results and Discussions 
4.1 Introduction 
This chapter introduces, explains as well as interprets the results of the 
preliminary material characterisation phase that are necessary in exploring the 
inherent aspects of the raw materials used in this paper. The physical properties, 
elemental composition and morphology of Granite Stone Dust (GSD) had been 
explored along with the chemical and physical properties of Hydrated Lime (HL) in 
the test certificate issued by the lab. These results form a good basis in analysing 
the behaviour of Granite Stone Dust modified asphalt mixes with a partial 
substitution of the substitute filler material with hydrated lime during subsequent 
stages of the experiment.  
4.2 Characterisation of Hydrated Lime. 
The hydrated lime (HL) used as the modifying agent in this study was acquired 
from Tororo Cement and was taken through the tests to establish its quality at the 
Central Materials Laboratory- Kireka.   
In this section, the secondary data, as in the test certificate (Ref: CML: 
012/26/08/25), was utilised to verify the quality of the material and also to gain 
deeper insight on the effect of the substance on the workability of the GSD 
modified asphalt mixtures because of the nature of its physical and chemical 
properties that have the potential to counter the shortcoming of the GSD nature.

4.2.1 The physical and chemical properties of Hydrated lime 
The test findings demonstrated that the procured hydrated lime was of good 
quality and met the required international construction lime standard, BS EN 459-
1: 2015. Its physical and chemical properties had a great many positive 
implications on the workability challenge experienced by GSD-modified asphalt.  
 Calcium and Magnesium oxides & Available lime: The combined 
Calcium and Magnesium Oxides content of 95% and Available Lime (as 
Ca(OH)2) concentration of 82% exceeded the standard's minimum 
standards. This high purity was important to the material's reactivity.  
Lime (Ca(OH)2) that was available in asphalt mixes reacted with polar 
constituents in bitumen to form calcium soaps (Little and Epps 2006). 

28 
 
 Free water content: This test was done to determine the quantity of 
water in the hydrated lime.  The amount of moisture in lime when its 
too high will cause foaming and release steam till it interacts with 
hot binder lime at (150-160°C)  Moisture Water Content of 0.5% was 
extremely low which was a most desirable property. This adversely 
impacts the integrity of the mixture that might leave voids and 
weaken the structure of the mixture (Han et al., 2019). This lime had 
a low Moisture content which facilitated enhanced binder aggregate 
coating and compaction. 
 Specific Gravity: The specific Gravity is necessary for volumetric 
calculations to facilitate carrying out of the Marshall mix design. This 
test identified the density of the hydrated lime in comparison with 
water. Specific Gravity of 2.45 calculated was found to be within 
normal range of hydrated lime (2.2 -2.4) as stated in literature and in 
the project proposal.  The objective was to ensure the best balance 
of density and air voids is achieved. 
The hydrated lime proved to possess adequate chemical and physical properties 
to facilitate the experimentation to understand the effect on the workability of 
the synergy between the GSD and hydrated lime mixture.

Figure 8: Fineness of Hydrated Lime 
 
This test is very important, as it gave a measure of the fineness of the lime, which 
is a determining factor in its efficiency when mixed with the asphalt. The test 
revealed that the hydrated lime is very fine, having 100% of it pass through the 
5.00 mm sieve and 20% of it pass through the 0.075 mm sieve, which is the No. 200 
sieve. Its high fineness is important in the project due to the following reasons: 
 Improved Reactivity and Filler Effectiveness: The higher surface area of the 
finer particles led to more points of contact between the particles and the 
asphalt binder to which chemical reactions could be enhanced.  This led to 
more beneficial calcium soap formation at the asphalt binder and aggregate 
interface, which is basically how finer hydrated lime increased adhesion and 
reduced Moisture Susceptibility (Little and Epps, 2006).  A finer lime is, 
therefore, a more reactive lime. 
 Improved Workability and Lubrication. The small, spherical, smooth 
particles of hydrated lime worked as a physical lubricant when mixed with 
the angular and rough texture of the Granite Stone Dust (GSD). These 
particles filled up the spaces between the large, angular particles of GSD 
and aggregate. As a result, the friction between the particles decreased. 
Consequently, the interlocking of particles, which made the mix of GSD stiff 
and difficult to compact, and the workability issue plaguing this study were 
significantly reduced. 
Therefore it can be concluded that the PSD proved that the hydrated lime 
possessed the necessary physical properties (fineness) to perform effectively either 

31 
 
as a chemical modifier and adhesion enhancer, and/or a physical lubricant to take 
advantage of the workability provided by the stiff GSD-modified asphalt. 
4.3 Granite stone dust: physical and chemical profile 
In this study, we closely examined the granite stone dust (GSD), which is the 
primary filler to be used by utilised for experimentation. It is essential to 
understand the physical and chemical properties. To establish the composition of 
the granite stone dust, we conducted X-ray Fluorescence (XRF), and to evaluate 
the shape and surfaces, we conducted a scanning electron microscope (SEM) test, 
which provided important information to explain the workability problems 
associated with GSD-modified asphalt. 
4.3.1. XRF Results for Granite Stone Dust 
Table 4.1 shows the elemental composition of the GSD sample analyzed by XRF, 
expressed as oxide percentage, following the Government Analytical Laboratory 
procedure (Job Desc: DFD 357/2025). 
Table 4; Source: Primary Data from Analytical Lab 
 
 Silicon Dioxide (SiO2): The significant constituent is the high percentage of 
SiO2, which is 72.30%. SiO2 is a chief ingredient of quartz, which is very 
hard and often has very sharp edges after it has been crushed. These sharp 

32 
 
edges are the reasons why mixes with the GSD were more frictional and 
stiffer (Oesman et al. 2021), which directly relates to workability. 
 Aluminosilicate framework: The presence of high amounts of Aluminium 
Oxide (Al2O3), Potassium Oxide (K2O), and Na2O suggests the presence of 
feldspar minerals common in granitic rocks. The aluminosilicate component 
is another factor adding to the inert and stable composition of the mixture 
within the asphalt. Unlike cement and hydrated lime, which react and can 
work to improve cohesiveness, GSD does not take part in any pozzolanic 
reaction. 
  Loss on Ignition (LOI):The low value of LOI, which is 0.38%, shows little 
presence of moisture, carbonates, and organics. It is an advantageous filler 
property because it translates to low volatility when mixed hot, which could 
result in voids and compromise the asphalt integrity. 
 Calcium Oxide (CaO): CaO is merely 1.86%, which is substantially less than 
the CaO present in hydrated lime (60% total CaO content). This reflects a 
total inability on the part of GSD to show any chemical reactivity, which 
could otherwise act as a binding agent between the aggregate and binder. 
4.3.2 Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) 
SEM analysis gave information on the texture and shape of the particles of GSD. 
Refer to Figure 4.1, which is the SEM photograph, to supplement the information 
on the chemical workability. 

33 
 
 
Figure 9; Source: Secondary data of the SEM imaging of Granite stone dust 
 Particle shape and angularity: The particle shape and angularity of GSD are 
clearly angular, with sharp and broken edges. These are due to the 
fracturing of granite, which is a hard rock. 
 Surface Texture: The particles are observed to have a rough, irregular 
structure under the microscope, which further increases the friction 
between the particles, thereby increasing the strength of the mixture. 
Taking into consideration the above points, it could be said that the observations 
show that the GSD used was locally extracted siliceous filler, which is chemically 
inert and has very angular and rough particles. 
4.3.2 Link to the workability 
The primary particle regime-related factor behind the decreased workability 
associated with asphalt mixtures modified by the addition of GSD is the presence 
of angular and rough particles. During the mixture and compaction phases, such 
particles are reluctant to slide against each other and the aggregate, which is 
more difficult and also tends to generate inconsistencies associated with 
separation (Gudimettla et al., 2004). This is associated with decreased density and 

34 
 
increased susceptibility to elevated pavement defects such as ravelling and 
cracking. 
4.4 Marshall Properties of Asphalt Mixture with varying Lime content 
The main objective of the experimental part of this research compromised 
batching and evaluating asphalt mixtures with varied percentages of Hydrated 
Lime (0%,1%,2%,3%,4%) partially replacing part of the Granite Stone Dust (GSD) 
filler. The table below compiles the Marshall Mix design results for every blend. 
Table 5: Summary of Marshall Properties 
 
4.4.1 Analysis of Marshall Properties 
1. Marshall Flow: The sample's vertical deformation at the peak load point. It 
gauged the mix's flexibility or plastic deformation. This was a direct 
indicator of workability. A mixture with a higher flow value was less stiff 
and more pliable, making it easier to compact and apply with in the field 
without leading to segregation. The mix was brittle and stiff (poor 
workability) if the flow was very low. It was too plastic and prone to rutting 
if the flow was extremely high. The ease of particle rearrangement under 
stress can be directly measured in a lab setting using the Marshall Flow 
value. The Flow value was a strong and direct indicator of workability and 

35 
 
compact-ability since compaction in the field was the process of pushing 
particle rearrangement for densification. It was evident from our raising 
flow values with lime concentration that we are lowering internal friction 
and improving the mixture's workability. 
In order to demonstrate that we had produced a workable but stable mix, 
we determined the lime concentration that provided us with a flow value 
within the ideal specification range (2-4mm). While a very high flow value 
can indicate a mix that was too plastic and prone to rutting, our optimal 
flow value of 3.6 mm for the 3% lime mix was a direct indicator of superior 
compact-ability. This was not about making construction easier for workers; 
it's about building a more durable road.  
A workable mix ensures we can achieve the target density in the field. 
There are fewer and smaller interconnecting air voids in a mix that has 
better compact-ability. This was because the internal resistance caused by 
the interlocking of the GSD, was mitigated by the HL, making the mixture 
easier to mix and compact, therefore achieving a higher density. As a result, 
water was kept out by a homogeneous layer that was almost impermeable. 
This directly stopped the ravelling, stripping, and potholes we observed on 
the Lweeza road because water seeps into the already weakly bonded 
aggregates and binder, the main source of the stripping damage. This 
improvement was demonstrated by our ITS test, which showed that the 3% 
lime mix maintained its strength even when wet with a 96% TSR. An increase 
in the flow value from our control at 3.3 mm to 3.6 mm at 3%, improved the 
durability significantly of the asphalt mixture for the 15-25 year design life 
that it’s supposed to serve for.  

36 
 
Essentially, we are enhancing more than simply constructability by 
increasing workability (as indicated by the higher flow number). We are 
directly ensuring the development of a more uniform, denser, impermeable 
pavement structure that was intrinsically more resilient. 
2. Marshall Stability: The Peak load that the sample can bear before failing. It 
gauged the mixture's shear strength to ensure we weren't creating a weak, 
mushy mix by increasing workability. We demonstrated that the lime-
modified mixture was genuinely more robust and resilient to shoving and 
rutting under vehicles. When HL was added, Marshall Stability rose by up to 
3%. With a peak stability of 16.7 kN, the 3% HL mix significantly 
outperformed the control mix by (13.3 kN). But at 4% HL, the stability fell to 
12.8 kN, which was less than the performance of the control mix. Lime 
modification significantly increased stability, with the 3% lime mix showing 
the peak strength (16.7 kN) 
It's a frequent misconception that a more workable blend has to be weaker. 
Our findings clearly disprove this trade-off. Not only did the 3% lime mixture 
become easier to deal with, but it also became stronger and more cohesive 
by nature. In addition to being brittle, weaker, and unworkable, the control 
mix (0% lime) had the lowest stability. Internal friction and particle 
interlock created a weak, brittle form of strength that causes cracking, at 
the points of its stiffness. 
We replaced the brittle, frictional strength with cohesive, ductile strength 
by adding hydrated lime. Two things were done by the lime; it improved 
workability and decreased the detrimental internal friction by physically 

37 
 
lubricating the angular GSD particles. It strengthened the binder-aggregate 
link chemically. 
The end product was a mixture that was easier to compact and stronger 
under load. Not only was the 3% lime combination easier to use, but it also 
performs better overall. It possessed the structural strength to withstand 
rutting and deformation under traffic for many years to come, as well as the 
workability to be compacted into a dense, impermeable layer in the field. 
Figure 10: Graph of Marshall Flow and Stability 
 
3. Density: This test can be used to measure density of compacted asphalt 
sample with a lot of accuracy. The sample is weighed in three conditions, 
namely, dry, in water, and saturated (surface-dry). With these weights we 
determined its volume and density. Determination of density is the gold 
standard for testing compact-ability. All samples in the laboratory are 
subjected to the same pressure (75 Marshall Hammer blows). Since mixes 
become more readily workable as their density increases, a higher density 

38 
 
achieved in one mix compared to another at the same compaction effort 
resulted in a more workable mix. The observation that our 3% lime mixture 
achieved the greatest specific gravity was sufficient testimony that it was 
the easiest to ram. The lime mix achieved a density of 2.344 kg/m3, the 
maximum compact-ability. 
Density and durability are synonymous in asphalt construction. Increasing 
the workability does not only make the work of construction workers easier, 
but it also helped directly in achieving a construction material which was 
more resistant to failure. 
4. Voids: The density achieved in the previous test and the theoretical 
maximum density of the mix facilitated the calculation of the percentage of 
small air gaps that were enclosed between the components. The air voids 
are vital to performance. Should it have been excessively low, this would 
have caused the asphalt to bleeding. The pavement will however become 
too permeable when the air voids are excessive. Moisture damage 
(stripping) can be induced by air and water intrusion through the voids and 
cause rapid binder aging. The huge air pores in the 0 % lime (control) 
mixture was a sign that it was hard to compress and was not easily 
workable. The 3 % lime mix achieved the optimal air voids about 4 %, which 
meant that we had the denser, optimised, and more workable mixture. 
The aim of this was a layer with semi-impermeability and possessing 
optimum voids. It is not so porous that the binder will ooze to the surface in 
hot climates, and it should also not be too impermeable so as to exclude 
most of the water and air, which will cause stripping and ageing. A 
pavement with optimal air voids experience wear and tear at a significantly 

39 
 
slower rate. Attainment of the optimal air voids basically was the final and 
conclusive evidence that we had turned around the difficult to mix asphalt 
to a more workable and durable mixture.

5. Moisture Susceptibility: This test determined the level of resistance of the 
asphalt mixture to cracking. The compressed sample was loaded along its 
vertical diameter; the sample was subjected to a stress condition and was 
pulled horizontally until it did part. This is done by under two conditions: 
 
i. 
Dry Condition: The inherent tensile strength of the sample was 
tested 
ii. 
Wet Condition: Samples were investigated in vacuum-saturated 
condition and then conditioned in a water bath. This was done 
to test the durability of the sample when exposed to water for 
extended periods.
