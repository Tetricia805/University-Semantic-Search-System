ABSTRACT 
Lubigi fecal sludge and waste water treatment plant currently operates using non-
conventional technology for treatment with drying of fecal sludge by evaporation and 
percolation. Although the plant has the capacity to manage human excreta from both 
the onsite and offsite sanitation facilities, there is high solid loading due to the 
incoming large volumes of waste what exceed the design capacity of the plant and a 
problem of longer drying periods than intended. There is need for optimum utilisation 
of the sludge drying beds and the treatment plant all together. This study aimed at 
assessing the use of water treatment sludge granules coated with poly aluminium 
chloride from water treatment sludge to enhance dewatering of fecal sludge. 
The raw fecal sludge samples were analysed for parameters of pH, electrical 
conductivity, moisture content and total solids. Water treatment sludge was also 
characterised using the X-ray fluorescence technique so as to determine whether the 
content of aluminium oxide present is suitable for the preparation of poly aluminium 
chloride. 
Water treatment sludge granules coated with poly aluminium chloride showed potential 
in dewatering of fecal sludge with the lowest moisture content of 25.3% and maximum 
total solids of 74.7% achieved with the 4g/l dosage.

CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION 
1.2 BACKGROUND 
Fecal sludge refers to the raw slurry or partially digested semi-solids resulting from a 
combination of Blackwater and human excreta (Strande, 2014). Management of fecal 
sludge is an important practice in sanitation maintenance and some of the activities 
and techniques include storage, collection, transportation, treatment and then 
disposal. On site facilities such as pit latrines, toilets, pour flash latrines and septic 
tanks are used in fecal sludge management at household levels (Emmanuel, 2019). In 
the world today, around 2.7 billion people are estimated to live in areas without proper 
sanitary facilities. According to the estimate world population of 5 billion people by 
2030 (WHO, 2014), around 1 billion of the onsite sanitation facilities will be located in 
urban areas (Hu et al., 2016) which would increase the amount of fecal sludge 
generated and thus require management. This provides a big challenge in the effective 
management of sludge in developing countries for example looking at the Republic of 
Uganda where over 90% of the population depends on the onsite sanitation facilities 
which are operated and maintained through empting, transporting and then treatment 
at the different fecal sludge treatment facilities (Gibson et al., 2018). Looking at 
Kampala, around 390 m3/day of fecal sludge is produced with an addition of 150 m3/day 
from the neighbouring districts. All this sludge is transported to Lubigi fecal sludge and 
wastewater treatment plant. This plant operates under the National Water and 
Sewerage Corporation and is located in Namungoona. It was commissioned in 2014 with 
a design capacity of 500 m3/day of wastewater and 400 m3/day of fecal sludge. For the 
fecal sludge section, the plant operates at 50% over the design capacity (KCCA, 2020).

Water treatment sludge refers to the residue produced from the water treatment 
processes of coagulation, flocculation and sedimentation. The Ggaba III water 
treatment plant produces about 113000 metric tons of water treatment sludge per year 
(Muhabuzi el al., 2023). The sludge contains aluminium salts such as aluminium 
hydroxide as the largest component, non-toxic elements and organic matter (Shi et al., 
2023). It is considered as waste and it is ever increasing due to treatment of water on 
a daily basis. Some water treatment plants consider managing the water treatment 
sludge through disposing it off to the landfills but scientific research has been or is 
being done to utilise this sludge through sustainable resource management.

1.2 PROBLEM STATEMENT 
The Lubigi fecal sludge and waste water treatment plant currently faces a challenge of 
slow dewatering process of sludge in the drying beds. The sludge currently dries for 6-
8 months although the sludge drying beds were designed with a drying period of 1-2 
months (site visit, 2024). This is attributed to the stickiness in sludge that makes the 
solid liquid separation process slow and thus exceeding the design period of 4 weeks 
(Rost, 2018). The plant has 48 sludge drying beds with with a capacity of 71 m3. The 
units are lined with sand filtering membrane on top of the gravel to allow slow sludge 
dewatering through infiltration (Lindberg, 2018). The remaining semisolid is left to dry 
for about 4-8 weeks and further stored for 6 months to remove pathogens making it 
suitable and safe for use (Rost, 2018; Velkushanova et al., 2021). The slow dewatering 
may also be a result of clogging of the filter beds, particle size of sand and the mix 
ratios of the sludge (Ngabirano, 2023). There is need to quicken the dewatering process 
and such that its then disinfected allow safe use for other applications like agriculture, 
making of fire briquettes. This project aimed at using water treatment sludge granules 
coated with poly aluminium chloride obtained from water treatment sludge to enhance 
the dewatering process of fecal sludge in the sludge drying beds at Lubigi Fecal sludge 
and waste water treatment plant.

1.3 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY 
1.3.1 Main objective 
The main objective of this research study is to access the use of water treatment sludge 
granules coated with poly aluminium chloride to enhance the dewatering of fecal 
sludge. 
1.3.2 Specific objectives 
To determine the parameters of fecal sludge. (Moisture content . pH, electrical 
conductivity and total solids) 
To determine the parameters of water treatment sludge. 
To evaluate the enhancement in dewatering of fecal sludge achieved with using water 
treatment granules coated with poly aluminium chloride. 
1.4 Research questions 
What are the parameters of fecal sludge at Lubigi fecal sludge and waste water 
treatment plant? 
What are the parameters of water treatment sludge? 
How much dewatering of fecal sludge in sludge drying beds can be achieved with the 
use of water treatment sludge granules coated with Poly aluminium chloride? 
 
1.5 Justification 
This study aims at using water treatment sludge granules coated with poly aluminium 
chloride to enhance the dewatering of fecal sludge in the sludge drying beds. With the 

5 
 
increasing challenges in fecal sludge management in developing countries and given the 
increase in the population increases the generation of fecal sludge. This triggers the 
need to look into potential ways of reducing the sludge and this could be through 
decreasing the dewatering time as well as ensuring safe use of this fecal sludge after it 
has been treated. 
Water treatment sludge refers to the residue generated during the water treatment 
process and this sludge contains not only aluminium compounds but also other non toxic 
elements and organic matter (Shi et al., 2023). The dried water treatment also contains 
aluminium based salts and this increases the settling velocity of the solid sludge thus 
enhancing the dewatering the dewater ability although the properties of this sludge 
could be improved as the sludge is reacted with poly aluminium chloride. The dried 
water treatment sludge contains aluminium hydroxide which when reacted with 
hydrochloric acid dissolves the aluminium salt and removing undissolved solids thus 
forming a solution containing aluminium chloride. 
Al(OH)3(aq) + 3HCl(aq) → AlCl3(aq) + 3H2O(l) 
The solution is further reacted with water to undergo hydrolysis thus forming aluminate 
species that enhance the formation of poly aluminium chloride. The obtained solution 
is then reacted with sodium hydroxide in the polymerization process to yield a solution 
containing poly aluminium chloride (Adamu, 2023) 
Al(OH)3(aq) + NaOH(aq) → Aln(OH)mCl3n-m (aq) + nNaCl(aq) 
Poly aluminium chloride produced from the reaction of the water treatment sludge with 
hydrochloric acid and through the polymerisation process has stable polymer chains 

6 
 
which enhance its flocculation and coagulations capabilities. This enables it to 
effectively bind the suspended solid and colloidal particles into large particles thus 
facility solid – liquid separation (Jin, 2016). This helps in enhancing the dewatering 
process. The end product from polymerisation contain sodium chloride which is also a 
good component to enhance the dewatering of sludge because its efficient in changing 
the surface charges and viscosity, the calcium ions compress the colloid double layers 
(Xinhau, 2013).  
1.6 Significance of the study 
Improving the dewatering process of the fecal sludge reduces the sludge volumes being 
handled at the plant which serves as a key component for the fecal sludge management. 
This also provides a better and efficient method for the treatment of sludge in that the 
risks associated with the pathogens are minimised such that the fecal sludge can be 
safely used for other uses without compromising the health of the users. This would 
also address the sustainable development goal number 6 of the United Nations which 
aims at ensuring proper management of sanitation. 
Utilising Poly aluminium chloride from water treatment sludge granules also promotes 
the sustainable practice in waste water management and resource management 
(Debasree, 2024).

CHAPTER 2: LITERATURE REVIEW 
2.1 Water treatment sludge 
Water treatment sludge refers to the by-product from the purification process of 
drinking water. It is generated from both the sedimentation process, sand filters and 
the back washing process during the cleaning of the filters. This sludge contains 
aluminium oxide and other non-toxic elements such as silicon dioxide, calcium oxide, 
magnesium oxide, iron (III) oxide and sodium oxide (Zhao et al., 2021).

With the increasing demand for potable water which is due to the rapidly growing world 
population and the urban expansion has also resulted into the generation and 
accumulation of large water treatment sludge volume which call for an economical and 
environmentally sustainable management measures. Currently, a few  practices have 
been developed to manage this waste and these include resource recovery, use of water 
treatment sludge as an adsorbent for heavy metals as well as the use of this water 
treatment sludge in brick making (Dassanayake et al., 2015). Water treatment sludge 
from Ggaba III  
 
2.2 Fecal sludge 
Fecal sludge refers to the human waste collected from onsite sanitation facilities such 
as pit latrines, ventilated improved pit latrines, composting latrines and septic tanks. 
Waste in the septic tanks decomposes over time and before it is transported to the 
treatment plant using cesspool emptier trucks to treatment plants (Reno, 2015). 
Fecal sludge may be categorised basing on its concentration in categories such as liquid 
fecal sludge, slurry fecal sludge, semi-solid fecal sludge and solid fecal sludge (Strande, 
2021). Fecal sludge may also be further catergorised basing on the methods of 
treatment and these include digested sludge, primary sludge, mixed sludge and mineral 
sludge.

2.2.1 Management of fecal sludge in Uganda 
Management of fecal sludge in Uganda has been predominantly handled by National 
Water and Sewerage Corporation, NWSC and Kampala Capital City Authority, KCCA for 
Kampala along with other stakeholders that are either directly or indirectly involved. 
KCCA provides environmental certificates and regulates private operators, National 
Environment Management Authority issues fecal waste transportation licenses while 
NWSC provides treatment plants (Laker, 2020). Fecal sludge in Kampala is handled and 
treated at Lubigi fecal sludge and waste water treatment plant which has a fecal sludge 
treatment capacity of 400m3/day. According to UNICEF, management of fecal sludge 
helps reduce risk of waterborne disease outbreaks in communities. 
Fecal matter from pit latrines and septic tanks in Kampala is collected and transported 
to Lubigi fecal sludge and waste water treatment plant where it is treated before use 
for agricultural practices, research, making of fire briquettes and so on. The main 
modes of fecal sludge emptying and transportation technologies used in Kampla include 
mechanised cesspools and semi mechanised gulpers (FSM alliance, 2023).

2.2.2 Waste water and fecal sludge treatment process 
The Lubigi fecal sludge and waste water treatment plant handles and treats both waste 
water and fecal sludge. The plant has a capacity of 5000m3/day for waste water and 
400m3/day for fecal sludge. This waste Is collected and delivered to the plant where it 
goes through primary, secondary and tertiary treatment. 
2.2.3 stages of treatment 
Screening 
Screening is the removal of solid materials in waste water using fine and course screens. 
Selection of type of screen to use depends on the septage composition and the 
requirements of the treatment process (Tayler, 2018). The smaller the size of the 
spacing with low velocity flow, the higher the efficiency of the plant and regular 
maintenance is required for removal of trapped solids (Rost, 2018). 
8mm screens are used to trap physical contaminants of relatively big size that flow 
along with waste water. These contaminants include pampers, sanitary pads, leaves, 
polythene bags, plastic bottles and so on. Removal of these objects helps prevent 
blockages and clogging id the system. The screens are occasionally cleaned using a rake. 

11 
 
 
Figure 2 8mm screens at Lubigi 
Grit chamber 
The grit chamber is used to remove grit particles in waste water that are fine enough 
to go through the bar screens. Grit includes fine sand soils and gravel. In this chamber, 
flow is slowed down so as to allow settlement of the particles. Grit that settles at the 
bottom is routinely removed manually using spades so as to maintain the efficiency of 
the process. 
Grit removal is a basic consideration for plants designed to receive a loading greater 
than 250m3/day and plants that use enclosed systems such as anaerobic ponds and 
sludge drying beds (Niwagaba, 2014). That plant is designed to receive 400m3/day thus 
qualifies to have this chamber as part of the treatment processes. 

12 
 
 
Figure 3 Grit chamber 
Sedimentation chamber 
The fecal waste from the grit chamber is directed into the sedimentation tank. Lubigi 
Fecal sludge and waste water treatment plant has two sedimentation chambers which 
operate in turns that is to say that one chamber is loaded for up to 3 months as the 
other is being dislodged. 
 
Figure 4 Sedimentation tank 
 
 

13 
 
Anaerobic ponds 
Anaerobic ponds do not have oxygen except at the top at the air liquid interface. The 
organic load produces anaerobic conditions that is there is no dissolved oxygen in the 
pond. These ponds function like open septic tanks and work efficiently in warm 
climates. The liquid effluent is retained in the ponds for about 4 days and then proceeds 
to the secondary stage of treatment (Verbyla, 2017). 
 
Figure 5 Aerobic pond 
The plant has shallow anaerobic ponds that receive liquid effluent from the 
sedimentation tanks. The anaerobic bacteria in the ponds breaks down the waste water 
and decomposes the it thereby forming sludge. The sludge is periodically removed using 
s dredging system. The anaerobic process results into formation of methane, ammonia 
and carbon dioxide (Aziza, 2022). These gases are toxic and do not support life of 
multiple eco systems. 
Facultative ponds 
Facultative ponds can be classified into primary and secondary facultative ponds where 
the primary facultative ponds receive raw waste water while the secondary facultative 

14 
 
ponds receive settled waste water (Chen et al., 2018). These ponds reduce on the 
biochemical oxygen demand.  Facultative ponds are a combination of aerobic and 
anaerobic ponds. The top zone has aerobic conditions while there are anaerobic 
conditions in the lower zones.  
Tertiary treatment 
This a system of treatment designed for nutrient removal and filtering of waste particles 
that might damage sensitive ecosystems. The wastewater is passes through additional 
filtering lagoons to remove the nutrients. Some of the methods usi=ed at this phase 
include sand filtration which helps remove particulate matter, enhanced biological 
phosphorous removal where specific bacteria called polyphosphate accumulate 
organisms that store phosphate in their tissue. 
2.2.4 Challenges faced in fecal sludge management. 
There is a challenge of rapidly growing population which requires expansion of existing 
facilities so as to handle fecal sludge and waste generated (Basika, 2024). There is also 
a challenge of unauthorised stakeholders involved in management of fecal sludge. A 
survey conducted under the Kampala fecal sludge management project showed that 
there were 15 trucks and 20tricycles operating yet not legalised to operate (KCCA, 
2018). 
2.3 Sludge drying beds 
These are either open or covered beds that use sand as a filtration medium for sludge 
from the sedimentation and the anaerobic ponds to allow drying of the sludge. Sludge 

15 
 
drying beds are commonly used to dewater sludge due to their affordability compared 
to the other techniques used. 
 
Figure 6 Sludge drying beds 
The sludge drying beds at Lubigi fecal sludge and waste water treatment plant are 
consistent of the the underlain course aggregates and then fine aggregates on top of 
which sludge is pumped on the beds. The pumped sludge is left to dry by evaporation 
and water percolating through the filter media of the bed (Gava, 2021). 
2.4 Poly aluminium chloride 
Poly aluminium chloride is an inorganic chemical with large polymers and that consists 
of monomers such as Al(OH)2+, Al(OH)2, dimers such as Al2(OH)24+, and trimer Al3(OH)45+ 
(Chen et al., 2018). Poly aluminium chloride is a superior aluminium based coagulant 
used for particulate matter removal and removal of small particles, heavy metals and 
precipitation of phosphates. This chemical has the ability to reduce the volatile 
suspended solids in that it aggregates the sludge flocs causing a more tightly bound 
extracellular polymeric substances remain in the sludge flocs (Chen et al., 2018).

3.2 Area of study 
In this study, the fecal sludge to be sampled is delivered from cesspool trucks from 
onsite sanitation facilities. The fecal sludge samples were collected from Lubigi fecal 
sludge and waste water treatment plant located in Namungoona, Rubaga division in 
Kampala district. The catch ment area of this facility consists of areas such as Makerere, 
Katanga, Mulago, Kalerwe, Bwaise and areas along the Northern Bypass (Okasio. A, 
2021).

3.4 MATERIAL AND METHODS 
3.4.1 Determining the physical chemical parameters of fecal sludge. 
The physical chemical parameters of interest were pH, electrical conductivity, moisture 
content and total solids. Characterisation was done using standard laboratory 
procedures.  
3.4.1.1 Sample collection and preservation 
Representative fecal sludge samples were collected from 10 cesspool emptier trucks. 
The collection bucket was cleaned with soap and water and dried so as to collect 
uncontaminated samples. The samples were then collected and emptied into a larger 
bucket of 10 litres so as to make a composite sample. The samples were then 
homogeneously stirred using a wooden stick and then poured in 6 clean bottles with 
each of capacity 1.5 litres. the samples were then analysed immediately for parameters 
of pH, electrical conductivity, moisture content and total solids.

3.4.1.2 Sample analysis 
The samples were analysed from the waste water quality laboratory at Lubigi fecal 
sludge and wastewater treatment plant. For pH and electrical conductivity, the glass 
beakers to be used were cleaned using distilled water and dried. The samples were 
shaken thoroughly well and the 30 ml of fecal sludge poured into the beakers.  A 
calibrated hatch sension+ MM374 GLP laboratory Multi-meter was used to measure pH 
and electrical conductivity. The electrode stands of the equipment were rinsed with 
distilled water and then immersed into the sludge samples.  Each time before a new 
sample was tested, the electrode stands were cleaned using distilled water. 
 
Figure 8 Determination of pH and electrical conductivity 
Moisture content and total solids were determined using gravimetric method where by 
a known volume of sample is evaporated to a constant weight. 9 aluminium crucibles 
were cleaned and oven dried at 1050C for 1 hour. The mass of dry aluminium crucibles 
was measured using a PDW 753e precision balance. Homogenised raw fecal sludge 
samples were then placed in the crucibles and weighed to obtain mas of wet sample,

M1. The samples were then oven dried for 24 hours at 1050C. The samples were then 
cooled in a desiccator so as to keep away moisture. At room temperature, the crucibles 
were removed and weighed again to obtain the mass of dry sample. Moisture content 
was then calculated as shown below.

3.4.2 Characterisation of water treatment sludge 
3.4.2.1 Sample collection and preservation 
Dried water treatment sludge was collected from Katosi Drinking Water Treatment 
plant. The sludge was wrapped into aluminium papers for preservation and to keep 
away external contaminants like moisture content and dust. The samples were then 
carried to the laboratory for analysis. The laboratory used was the Geochemistry 
Laboratory of College of Natural Sciences of Makerere University. 
3.4.2.2 Sample analysis 
The moisture content of the water treatment sludge was determined. The aluminium 
crucibles (3) were cleaned with distilled water and then oven dried for 30 minutes at 
1050C. The crucibles were weighed using an FX – 300i reloading precision balance and 
the respective weights recorded. Part of the sludge was weighed and placed in an oven 
set at 1050C for 24 hours. The samples were then cooled, weiged again and moisture 
content calculated. 

21 
 
Then, 8g of dry water treatment sludge was mixed homogeneously with 2g of ceridust 
cellulose using a mortar. The cellulose was used as binder so as to hold the sludge 
together when making a pellet. The mixture was then placed in collapsible aluminium 
cups and moulded into a pellet using a bench top press TP 20E set at 200KN. The pellet 
was then analysed using a Rayonsx PAN analytical Epsilon1 X-Ray spectrometer to 
determine the chemical composition of the water treatment sludge. 
3.4.2.3 Preparation of water treatment sludge granules 
100g of starch, an organic binder was added to 400g of water treatment sludge and 
mixed with 220ml of distilled water. the mixture was kneaded in a basin until a uniform 
paste was made. The paste was then cast in a moulding tray and then air dried for 12 
hours. The granules were then removed and oven fried for 24 hours at a temperature 
of 1200C. This was done so as to improve on their water resistance through thermal 
modification (Lui Zhang, 2019). 
3.4.2.4 Preparation of Poly aluminium chloride 
80g of water treatment sludge was placed in a glass beaker and 270ml of 1M 
hydrochloric acid was added to the sludge and then stired for 20 minutes so as to 
dissolve the aluminium ions present in the sludge (Wang et al., 2020 ). 550ml of distilled 
water waere then added to the mixture and stirred for 5 minutes to dissolve the 
aluminium chloride ( Lui et aj., 2019). The mixture was then filtered and 1M sodium 
hydroxide added to synthesise a poly aluminium chloride solution. The solution obtained 
was pale yellow with a pH of 3.74 which is in the range of 3.5-5.5 for poly aluminium 
chloride (Lui et al., 2013; Yan et al., 2016).

3.5 Determination of dosage of water treatment sludge granules required 
A small scale field unit of 1m3 at Lubigi fecal sludge and waste water treatment plant 
was used. The unit has four dosing components 1,2,3,4 which were dosed with 0,3,6,9 
water treatment sludge granules respectively. 20l of fecal sludge from the 
sedimentation tank was added to each of the compartments. The initial parameter of 
moisture content and total solids were determined.

CHAPTER 4: RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
4.1 Introduction 
This chapter contains results obtained from the different tests carried out on the fecal 
sludge samples collected from Lubigi wastewater and fecal sludge treatment plant and 
the water treatment sludge samples obtained from Katosi Drinking Water Treatment 
Plant intended to answer the research questions of the study and ultimately achieving 
the main aim of the study. 
4.2 Fecal sludge analysis 
The composite mixture of the fecal sludge samples was tested to obtain the base line 
data of the raw fecal sludge parameters.

pH refers to the measurement of hydrogen ions activity present in solution (Alar, 2019), 
whereby a very low pH limits the aggregation of particles due to presence of less than 

24 
 
optimum ions to support agglomeration (Xuan Lui et al., 2012). A high pH causes the 
aggregated particles to re-disperse because of the direct correlation that exists 
between the size of the particles and the pH which later leads to disintegration (Xuan 
Lui et al., 2012). The pH test on the fecal sludge samples gave a neutral pH with an 
average value of 7.5. This offers am optimum environment to support the addition of a 
chemical conditioner. 
Moisture content influences the mechanical properties of fecal sludge and this affects 
its handling and final disposal process (Van Haandel and lettinga, 1994). An average 
moisture content of 72.6% was obtained and this falls within the range of < 75% of 
moisture content which indicates that the sludge is solid sludge and therefore a 
chemical conditioner would enhance the dewatering efficiency of sludge (Strande ).  
Total solids concentration comes from a variety of organic and inorganic matter 
comprised of floating, settleable matter, colloidal material and matter in solution 
(Niwagaba, 2014). The average value of total solids obtained was 27.4% and this value 
falls within range of 15-40% which suggests that the sludge is solid sludge (Strande).  
4.3 Water treatment sludge 
Following the understanding of the sludge parameters that influence the rate of 
dewatering, there is need to comprehend the chemical characteristics of a conditioner, 
that is water treatment sludge granules coated with poly aluminium chloride. The poly 
aluminium chloride was synthesed from water treatment sludge based on the 38.8% 
composition of aluminium oxide.

sludge is composed of oxides and 19.4% moisture content.

cations of these compounds are coagulants. The presence of Al2O3 as the dominant 
component illustrates the water treatment sludge can effectively be used in the 
preparation of poly aluminium chloride. 
4.4 Effect of water treatment sludge granules coated with Poly aluminium chloride 
Fecal sludge was dosed with 0 g/l, 2g/l, 4g/l and 6g/l of water treatment sludge 
granules coated with poly aluminium chloride and the change in parameters of moisture 
content and total solids was monitored after an interval of 7 days for 28 days.

From the graphs, it was observed that 4g/l dosage of the water treatment sludge 
granules achieved the least moisture content of 25.3% compared to the other doses 
0,2,4 and 6 g/l that yielded 36.1%, 34% and 29.3% moisture content observed after 28 
days. 
The moisture content of the fecal sludge reduced rapidly for the first 14 days and then 
gradually for the latter 14 days. The dose of 4g/l had a faster dewatering which was 
obtained as 25.3% and thus this was taken as the optimum dose for fecal sludge 
dewatering.

Similarly, the water treatment granule dose of 4g/l achieved the highest concentration

a total solids concentration of 63.9%, 66.1% and 70.7% respectively after 28 days of 
drying. 
The concentration of total solids in fecal sludge depends on the moisture content.

4.4.3  Dosage in wet conditions 
During the wet season, the moisture content within the fecal sludge in the sludge drying 
beds increases considerably due to rainfall infiltration (Kaza, 2017). This affects the 
dosage of water treatment sludge granules (Murray et al., 2018). 
From the obtained results for the dry season, the poly aluminium chloride coated water 
treatment sludge granules achieved a dewatering efficiency of 25.3% for the dose of 
4g/l. Using the obtained dose and the moderate increase in the doses used can be used

to obtain the required dose required for dewatering of fecal sludge during the wet 
season (Tchobanoglous et al., 2014). 
Increase in dosage = percentage reduction in moisture content x optimum dosage       
                              = 0.253 x 4 = 1.012 
optimum dose in wet season = dosage in dry season x increase in dosage

                                                     = 6g/l 
Maximum dosage for wet season: 
     = dry season dosage x increment in dosage 
     =
4g
l  x 2 =

Therefore the dosage of 6g/l – 8g/l will be added to the sludge drying beds in the wet 
season to achieve the dewatering of fecal sludge.

CHAPTER 5: CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION 
5.1 Conclusion 
This research focused on assessing the use of water treatment sludge granules coated 
with poly aluminium chloride to improve on the dewatering of fecal sludge at Lubigi 
Fecal sludge and waste water treatment plant. The raw fecal sludge was tested for 
parameters that influence the addition of a conditioner. 
The chemical composition of water treatment sludge was also determined with 
aluminium oxide as the dominant compound with 38.8% composition. This percentage 
was sufficient enough for the production of poly aluminium chloride solution from water 
treatment sludge. The solution obtained was of pH 3.48 and had a yellowish colour. The 
water treatment sludge was also used to form granules each of weight 10g and these 
granules dipped in a solution of poly aluminium chloride to improve the polymeric 
structure and adsorption potential of the granules to be used for dewatering fecal 
sludge. A small scale field unit with 4 dosing compartments was then used to determine 
rate of dewatering of the coated granules after 28 days with the dosage of 4g/l yielding 
the lowest moisture content of 25.3% and maximum total solids concentration of 74.7%. 
5.2 Recommendations 
From this research study, the addition of water treatment sludge granules coated with 
poly aluminium chloride had a comparative effect on the dewatering performance in 
the sludge drying bed and the quality of manure.  
However further studies should be conducted to determine the impact of the water 
treatment sludge granules coated with Poly aluminium chloride on the volatile solids 

37 
 
and the pathogenic organisms in the fecal sludge and how fast pathogens in the fecal 
sludge can be reduced before use for agriculture.  
The management of Lubigi fecal sludge and waste water treatment plant should adjust 
the size of the drainage pipes in the sludge drying beds from 300mm to 350mm so as to 
handle the increased flow rate due to addition of the material.
