Software
© ISBAT UNIVERSITY –2023.
A sequence of instructions written in a language understood by a
computer is called a computer program.
Software refers to a set of programs, procedures, and associated
documents
(flow
charts,
manuals,
etc.)
describing
the
programs, and how they are to be used.
A software package is a group of programs that solve a specific
problem or perform a specific type of job. e.g. a word
processing package may contain programs for text editing, text
formatting, drawing graphics, spell checking…

Relationship between Hardware & Software
© ISBAT UNIVERSITY –2023.
Both hardware and software are necessary for a computer to
do a useful job. Both are complementary to each other.
Same hardware can be loaded with different software to
make a computer perform different types of jobs.
Except for upgrades (like increasing main memory and hard
disk capacities, or adding speakers, modems, etc.) hardware
is normally a one time expense, whereas software is a
continuous expense.

Types of Software

System Software: Is a set of one or more programs designed to
control the operation and extend the processing capability of a
computer system.
System software performs one or more of the following:
Supports development of other application software.
Supports the execution of other application software.
Monitors the effective use of various hardware resources such 
as the CPU, memory, peripherals, etc.
Communicates with and controls operation of peripheral devices 
such as printer, disk, tape, etc.

Types of Software continued…
Programs included in a system software package are called system programs. The
programmers
who
prepare
system
software
are
referred
to
as
system
programmers.
Commonly known types of System Software;
1.
Operating systems: These take care of efficient effective utilization of all
hardware and software components of a computer system.
2.
Programming language translators: These transform the instructions prepared
by programmers in a programming language into a form that can be interpreted
and executed by a computer system.
3.
Communications softwares: These enable transfer of data and programs from
one computer system to another in a network environment.
4.
Utility programs: These help users in system maintenance tasks, and in
performing of tasks of routine nature. e.g. formatting hard disks, taking backup
of data, sorting of data

Application Software: Is a set of one or more programs designed to solve a specific
problem, or do a specific task.
Programs included in an application software package are called application programs.
The programmers who prepare application software are referred to as application
programmers.
Examples include;
Word processing software: enables us to use computers for creating, editing,
viewing, formatting, storing, retrieving, and printing documents.
Database Software: enables us to create a database, maintain it, organize its data,
and selectively retrieve useful information from it.
Graphics software:
Personal Assistance software:

Firmware
Is a sequence of instructions (software) substituted for
hardware and stored in a Read Only Memory (ROM) chip of a
computer.
Firmware is frequently a cost-effective alternative to wired
electronic circuits and its use in compute design is gradually
increasing.
Increased use has today made it possible to produce smart
machines of all types. These machines have microprocessor
chips with embedded software.

Is a set of tools and data that helps applications use networked resources and
services.
It is a separate software layer that acts as “glue” between the client and server
parts of an application and provides a programming abstraction as well as
masks the heterogeneity of underlying networks, hardware, and operating
system from application programmers.
Examples include;
Web servers
Application servers
Telecommunication softwares
Transaction monitors
Messaging and queueing software

Computer Programming Languages
A language acceptable to a computer system is called a
Computer language or programming language, and the
process of off writing instructions in such a language is
called programming or coding.
The words and symbols of a computer language must be
used as per the set rules known as syntax rules.
Computer programming languages are classified into two;
Low Level Languages
High Level languages

Low Level Languages (LLL)
© ISBAT UNIVERSITY –2023.
Machine Language: Is the only language the computer understands without
using a translation program.
Is normally written as a string of 1s and 0s but doesn’t necessarily have to
be. It can also be written using decimal digits if the computer circuitry
permits this.
The circuitry of a computer is wired in a way that it recognizes the machine
language instructions immediately, and converts them into electrical signals
needed to execute them.

Advantages & Disadvantages of Machine Language
Advantages:
Can be executed very fast because of no need for translation.
They occupy less memory.
Processing speed is high because it is one to one language.
Disadvantage:
Machine Dependent: Internal design of every computer is different from the
other, so also the language differs.
Difficult to program: it needs the programmer to memorize dozens of operation
code numbers, keep track of storage locations of data and instructions, must
know hardware structure.
Error prone: makes it difficult for the programmer to concentrate fully on the
logic resulting in errors.
Difficult to modify: Checking machine instruction s to locate errors is very difficult
and time consuming.

Advantages & Disadvantages of Assembly Language
© ISBAT UNIVERSITY –2023.
Advantages:
Easier to understand and use
Easier to locate and correct errors: Assemblers automatically detect 
and indicate errors.
Easier to modify
No worry about addresses.
Easily relocatable.
Efficiency of machine language.
Disadvantages:
•
Machine dependent
•
Knowledge of hardware required
•
Machine level coding

Low Level Languages (LLL)
© ISBAT UNIVERSITY –2023.
Assembly or Symbolic Language: This allows instructions and storage locations 
to be represented by letters and symbols instead of numbers.
An assembly language must be converted (translated) into its equivalent  
machine language program before it can be executed on the computer.
This translation is done by the help of a translator program called an
Assembler.
Assembler is system software supplied by the computer manufactures.
It is called assembler because in addition to translating, it also assembles the
machine language program in main memory of the computer and makes it
ready for execution.
During the process of translation, the source program is NOT under execution.
It is only converted into a form that can be executed by the computer.

Introduction
© ISBAT UNIVERSITY –2023.
A computer system can be divided roughly into four
components:
Hardware - The central processing unit (CPU), the
memory, and the input / output (I/O) devices - provide
the basic computing resources.
Application Programs - define the ways in which these
resources are used to solve the computing problems of
the users.
Operating System - controls and coordinates the use of
the hardware among the various application programs
for the various users.
Users

Definition:
© ISBAT UNIVERSITY –2023.
An Operating System (often referred to as OS) is an
integrated
set of
programs that controls the
resources (CPU, memory, I/O devices, etc.) of a
computer system and provides its users with an
interface or virtual machine that is easier to use
than the bare machine.

© ISBAT UNIVERSITY –2023.
Primary Objectives of the OS
Make a computer system easier to use.
It hides details of hardware resources from programmers and
other users & provides them with a convenient interface for
using a computer system. It acts as an intermediary between
the hardware and its users, providing high-level interface to
low-level hardware.
Manage the resources of a computer system
It involves such tasks as keeping track of who is using what
resource usage, and
resources,
granting
resource
mediating
requests, 
conflicting
accounting
for  
requests from
different programs and users. Efficient and fair sharing of  
system resources among users and/ or programs is a key goal
of all operating systems.

Main Functions Of An Operating System…
Process Management: taking care of creation and deletion of
processes, scheduling of different resources to different
processes and providing mechanisms for synchronization and
communication among processes.
Memory Management: taking care of allocation & de-
allocation of memory space to programs.
File Management: file related activities such as organization,
storage, retrieval, naming, sharing and protection of files.
Security: protecting the resources and information of a
computer system
against
destruction
and
unauthorized
access.

Measuring SystemPerformance
Efficiency of an Operating System and overall performance of a
computer system are measured usually in terms of the following
parameters.
Throughput: Is the amount of work that the system is able to do per
unit time.
Turnaround Time: How long it takes a system to complete a job
submitted by a user. It is the interval between the time of
submission of a job to the system for processing to the time of job
completion
Response Time: it is the interval between the time of submission of
a job to the system for processing to the time of the system
producing the first response.

Functions of the Operating System
© ISBAT UNIVERSITY –2023.
Operating systems vary in the way they accomplish there
tasks.
Mainframe operating systems are designed primarily to
optimize utilization of hardware.
Personal
computer
(PC)
operating
systems
support
complex games, business applications, and everything in
between.
Handheld computer operating systems are designed to
provide an environment in which a user can easily interface
with the computer to execute programs.
Thus,
some
operating
systems
are
designed
to
be
convenient, others to be efficient, and some others, a
combination of the two.
