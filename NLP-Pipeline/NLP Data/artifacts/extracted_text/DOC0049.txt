Continuity of Functions
3.1
Informal deﬁnition of Continuity of a function
Deﬁnition 3.1.1
We start by stating what we call an informal deﬁnition of continuity
of a function.
This clearly presents what exactly is meant by a function f(x) being
Continuous at the point x = a.
We say that a function f(x) is continuous at x = a if
(a) the lim
x→a f(x) exists ie
lim
x→a−f(x) = lim
x→a+ f(x)
(b) the functional value f(a) exists.
(c) lim
x→a f(x) = f(a)
From the three conditions, it is suﬃcient to say that a function f(x) is continuous at
x = a if
lim
x→a f(x)
=
f(a)
However, if f(x) is not Continuous at x = a we say that it is discontinuous at x = a.
Note 3.1.1
1. Polynomial functions are continuous at all points on the real axis R
2. Rational functions are Continuous on the entire axis R except at the poles.
Note 3.1.2
If one of the conditions above fails, then the function is not continuous at
that point.

CHAPTER 3. CONTINUITY OF FUNCTIONS
Example 3.1.1 Show that the polynomial function f(x) = x2 + 2x + 1 is continuous at
x = 2
Since
(a) limx→2(x2 + 2x + 1) = 22 + 2(2) + 1 = 9 i.e exists
(b) f(2) = 22 + 2(2) + 1 = 9 i.e exists
(c) limx→2 f(x) = f(2) = 9
Hence f(x) = x2 + 2x + 1 is continuous at x = 2. In fact being a polynomial function, it
is continuous at all points on R
Example 3.1.2
Show that the rational function,
f(x)
=
x + 2
x −1
is continuous at x = 3
Since x = 3 is not a pole of the rational function for all substitution of 3 in the function,
the denominator does not go to zero. Checking through the conditions of Continuity,
(a)
lim
x→3
x + 2
x −1 = 3 + 2
3 −1 = 5
2
(b)
f(3) = 3 + 2
3 −1 = 5
2
(c)
lim
x→3 f(x) = f(3) = 5
2
Therefore f(x) = x+2
x−1 is continuous at x = 3, indeed f(x) is continuous at all points R
except x = 1.

CHAPTER 3. CONTINUITY OF FUNCTIONS
Example 3.1.3
Check whether the function
f(x) =
 x2 −1,
x < 3
2x + 2,
x ≥3
is continuous at x = 3
(a) lim
x→3 f(x) ??
lim
x→3−f(x)
=
lim
x→3(x2 −1) = 8
lim
x→3+ f(x)
=
lim
x→3(2x + 2) = 8
Thus the limit exists and equal to 8, that is
lim
x→3 f(x) = 8
(b) f(3) = 2(3) + 2 = 8
(c)
lim
x→3 f(x) = f(3) = 8
Therefore, the function is continuous.
Example 3.1.4
Check whether the function f(x) below is continuous at x = 1.
f(x) =
 2x + 1,
x ≥1
4x,
x < 1
(a) lim
x→3 f(x)??
lim
x→1−f(x) = lim
x→1(4x) = 4
&
lim
x→1+ f(x) = lim
x→1(2x + 1) = 3
Thus the limit does not exists.
(b) No need to check for f(1) = 2(1) + 1 = 3
Therefore, the function is not continuous, since one of the properties fails.

CHAPTER 3. CONTINUITY OF FUNCTIONS
Example 3.1.5
Given the function,
f(x) =



x3,
x ≤2
α −x,
x > 2
Find the scalar α for which f(x) is continuous at x = 2.
f(x) is continuous at x = 2 if lim
x→2 f(x) exists and limx→2 f(x) = f(2). But for the lim
x→2 f(x)
to exist,
lim
x→2−f(x)
=
lim
x→2+ f(x)
lim
x→2 x3
=
lim
x→2(α −x)
⇒8
=
α −2
⇒α
=
10
Therefore when α = 10,
lim
x→2 f(x)
=
f(2)
Implying that f(x) is continuous at x = 2
Example 3.1.6
Determine the value of k such that,
f(x) =



x2 −k2,
x ≤2
kx + 5,
x > 2
f(x) is continuous at x = 2.
f(x) is continuous at x = 2 if the lim
x→2 f(x) to exist,
lim
x→2−f(x)
=
lim
x→2+ f(x)
lim
x→2 x2 −k2
=

CHAPTER 3. CONTINUITY OF FUNCTIONS
Example 3.1.7
Modify the deﬁnition of f(x) such that it is continuous at the point
x = a if
f(x) = x2 −1
x −1
(a ̸= 1)
To modify is to redeﬁne a function, so that it is deﬁned everywhere, this is done by
deﬁning the function, as its limits where was initially undeﬁned.
f(x) =



x2−1
x−1 ,
a ̸= 1
2,
a = 1
Note that the limit 2 has been got by ﬁnding the limit of f(x) by La’Hopital rule.
Example 3.1.8 Show that the function f(x) below is discontinuous at x = −2.
f(x) =
x3 + x −2
x3 −x2 −6x
We realise that, f(x) is not deﬁned at x = −2, thus function is not continuous.
Example 3.1.9 Show that the function f(x) = x2 + 2x + 1 is continuous at x = 2
It is enough to show that it satisﬁes the three conditions of continuity.
Example 3.1.10
Determine if the following function is continuous at x = 1.
f(x) =



3x −5,
if x ̸= 1
7,
if x = 1
(a) The limit
lim
x→1 f(x) = lim
x→1(3x −5) = −2
i.e.,
lim
x→1 f(x) = −2
(b) But f(1) = 7, the function f(x) is deﬁned at x = 1.
(c) Since lim
x→1 f(x) ̸= f(1), then condition (c) is not satisﬁed and function f is not con-
tinuous at x = 1.

CHAPTER 3. CONTINUITY OF FUNCTIONS
Example 3.1.11
Determine if the following function is continuous at x = −2.
f(x) =



x2 + 2x,
if x ≤−2
x3 −6x,
if x > −2
(a) The left-hand limit
lim
x→−2−f(x) =
lim
x→−2−(x2 + 2x) = 0
The right-hand limit
lim
x→−2+ f(x) =
lim
x→−2+(x3 −6x) = 4
Since the left-hand and right-hand limits are not equal, lim
x→−2 f(x) does not exist.
(b) Although the function f is deﬁned at x = −2 since
f(−2) = (−2)2 + 2(−2) = 4 −4 = 0
Thus, function f is not continuous at x = −2 as the ﬁrst condition failed.
Example 3.1.12
Determine if the following function is continuous at x = 0.
f(x) =



x−6
x−3,
if x < 0
2,
if x = 0
√
4 + x2,
if x > 0
(a) The left-hand limit
lim
x→0−f(x) = lim
x→0−
x −6
x −3 = −6
−3 = 2
The right-hand limit
lim
x→0+ f(x) = lim
x→0+
√
4 + x2 =
p
4 + (0)2 = 2
Thus, lim
x→0 f(x) exists with lim
x→0 f(x) = 2.
(b) The function f is deﬁned at x = 0 sincef(0) = 2,
(c) Since lim
x→0 f(x) = 2 = f(0), all three conditions satisﬁed ⇒f is continuous at x = 0.

= (3)2 + 3(3) + 9
(3) + 3
= 9
2
Could even have applied the La’Hopital rule to compute the limit above. i.e.,
lim
x→3 f(x) = 9
2
(b) The function f is deﬁned at x = 3 sincef(3) = 9
2
(c) Since,
lim
x→3 f(x) = 9
2 = f(3)
all three conditions are satisﬁed, and f is continuous at x = 3. Now, check for continuity
at x = −3.
Continuity at x = −3
Function f is not deﬁned at x = −3 because of division by zero. Thus, f(−3) does not
exist, condition (b) is violated, and thus f is not continuous at x = −3.

CHAPTER 3. CONTINUITY OF FUNCTIONS
Example 3.1.14
Show that the function f(x) = sin x is continuous at all numbers x.
First, f is deﬁned for all x ∈R. Let a be an arbitrary real number. Then
lim
h→0 f(a + h)
=
lim
h→0 sin(a + h)
=
lim
h→0[sin a cos h + cos a sin h]

lim

+ cos a

lim
h→0 sin h

=
(sin a)(1) + cos a(0)
=
sin a
=
f(a)
Since a was arbitrary f is continuous on R.
Example 3.1.15 For what values of x is the function f(x) = x2 + 3x + 5
x2 + 3x −4 continuous?
Functions y = x2 + 3x + 5 and y = x2 + 3x −4 are continuous for all values of x since
both are polynomials. Thus, the quotient of these two functions, f(x) = x2 + 3x + 5
x2 + 3x −4 is
continuous for all values of x where the denominator, y = x2 + 3x −4 = (x −1)(x + 4)
does NOT equal zero. Since (x −1)(x + 4) = 0 for x = 1 and x = −4, function f is
continuous for all values of x except x = 1 and x = −4.
Example 3.1.16 For what values of x is the function g(x) = (sin(x20+5))1/3 continuous?
First describe function g using functional composition. Let f(x) = x
1
3, h(x) = sin x, and
k(x) = x20 + 5. Function k is continuous for all values of x since it is a polynomial, and
functions f and h are well-known to be continuous for all values of x. Thus, the functional
compositions
h(k(x)) = sin(k(x)) = sin(x20 + 5)
and
f(h(k(x))) = (h(k(x)))1/3 = (sin(x20 + 5))1/3
are continuous for all values of x. Since
g(x) = (sin(x20 + 5))1/3 = f(h(k(x)))
function g is continuous for all values of x.

CHAPTER 3. CONTINUITY OF FUNCTIONS
Example 3.1.17
For what values of x is the function f(x) =
√
x2 −2x continuous ?
First describe function f using functional composition. Let g(x) = x2−2x and h(x) = √x
Function g is continuous for all values of x since it is a polynomial, and function h is well-
known to be continuous for x ≥0. Since g(x) = x2 −2x = x(x −2), it follows easily that
g(x) ≥0 for x ≤0 and x ≥2. Thus, the functional composition
h(g(x)) =
p
g(x) =
√
x2 −2x
is continuous for x ≤0 and x ≥2. Since
f(x) =
√
x2 −2x = h(g(x))
function f is continuous for x ≤0 and x ≥2.
Example 3.1.18
For what values of x is the function f(x) = ln
x −1
x + 2

continuous?
First describe function f using functional composition. Let g(x) = x −1
x + 2 and h(x) = ln x
Since g is the quotient of polynomials y = x−1 and y = x+2, function g is continuous for
all values of x except where x + 2 = 0, i.e., except for x = −2. Function h is well-known
to be continuous for x > 0. Since g(x) = x −1
x + 2, it follows easily that g(x) > 0 for x < −2
and x > 1. Thus, the functional composition
h(g(x)) = ln (g(x)) = ln
x −1
x + 2

is continuous for x < −2 and x > 1. Since
f(x) = ln
x −1
x + 2

= h(g(x))
function f is continuous for x < −2 and x > 1
[The ln is not deﬁned at negative values. But also the quotient is always taken seriously
with the denominator]

CHAPTER 3. CONTINUITY OF FUNCTIONS
Example 3.1.19
For what values of x is the function f(x) =
esin x
4 −
√
x2 −9 continuous?
First describe function f using functional composition. Let g(x) = sin x and h(x) = ex,
both of which are well-known to be continuous for all values of x. Thus, the numerator
y = esin x = h(g(x)) is continuous (the functional composition of continuous functions) for
all values of x. Now consider the denominator y = 4 −
√
x2 −9. Let
g(x) = 4, h(x) = x2 −9, and k(x) = √x
Functions g and h are continuous for all values of x since both are polynomials, and it is
well-known that function k is continuous for x ≥0. Since h(x) = x2−9 = (x−3)(x+3) = 0
when x = 3 or x = −3, it follows easily that h(x) ≥0 for x ≥3 and x ≤−3, so that
y =
√
x2 −9 = k(h(x)) is continuous (the functional composition of continuous functions)
for x ≥3 and x ≤−3. Thus, the denominator y = 4 −
√
x2 −9 is continuous (the
diﬀerence of continuous functions) for x ≥3 and x ≤−3.
There is one other important consideration. We must insure that the denominator is
never zero. If
y = 4 −
√
x2 −9 = 0
then
4 =
√
x2 −9
Squaring both sides, we get
16 = x2 −9
so that
x2 = 25
when
x = 5 or x = −5
Thus, the denominator is zero if x = 5 or x = −5. Summarizing, the quotient of these
continuous functions, f(x) =
esin x
4 −
√
x2 −9, is continuous for x ≥3 and x ≤−3, but not
for x = 5 and x = −5.

Consider separately the three component functions which determine f. Function
y = x −1
√x −1
is continuous for x > 1 since it is the quotient of continuous functions and the denominator
is never zero.
Function y = 5 −3x is continuous for −2 ≤x ≤1 since it is a polynomial.
Function
y =

x −4
is continuous for x < −2 since it is the quotient of continuous functions and the denomi-
nator is never zero.
Now check for continuity of f where the three components are joined together, i.e., check
for continuity at x = 1 and x = −2.

(c) Since

all three conditions are satisﬁed, and function f is continuous at x = 1.

(b) Although the function f is deﬁned at x = −2 since f(−2) = 5 −3(−2) = 11
condition (a) is violated, and function f is not continuous at x = −2.

CHAPTER 3. CONTINUITY OF FUNCTIONS
Example 3.1.21
Determine all values of the constant A so that the following function
is continuous for all values of x.
f(x) =



A2x −A,
if x ≥3
4,
if x < 3
First, consider separately the two components which determine function f.
Function y = A2x−A is continuous for x ≥3 for any value of A since it is a polynomial.
Function y = 4 is continuous for x < 3 since it is a polynomial.
Now determine A so that function f is continuous at x = 3.
(a) The right-hand limit
lim
x→3+ f(x) = lim
x→3+(A2x −A) = 3A2 −A
The left-hand limit
lim
x→3−f(x) = lim
x→3−4 = 4
For the limit to exist, the right- and left-hand limits must exist and be equal. Thus,
lim
x→3 f(x) = 3A2 −A = 4
⇒
3A2 −A −4 = 0
⇒
(3A −4)(A + 1) = 0


Ax −B,
if x ≤−1
2x2 + 3A + B,
if
−1 < x ≤1
4,
if x > 1
First, consider separately the three components which determine function f.
Function y = Ax −B is continuous for x ≤−1 for any values of A and B since it is a
polynomial.
Function y = 2x2 + 3Ax + B is continuous for −1 < x ≤1 for any values of A and B
since it is a polynomial.
Function y = 4 is continuous for x > 1 since it is a polynomial.
Now determine A and B so that function f is continuous at x = −1 and x = 1.
Continuity at x = −1:
(a) The left-hand limit
lim
x→−1−f(x) =
lim
x→−1−(Ax −B) = A(−1) −B = −A −B
The right-hand limit
lim
x→−1+ f(x) =
lim
x→−1+(2x2 + 3Ax + B) = 2(−1)2 + 3A(−1) + B = 2 −3A + B
For the limit to exist, the right- and left-hand limits must exist and be equal. Thus,
lim

so that
2A −2B = 2

CHAPTER 3. CONTINUITY OF FUNCTIONS
(b) The function will be deﬁned at x = −1 as f(−1) = A(−1) −B = −A −B
Now consider Continuity at x = 1:
(a) The left-hand limit
lim
x→1−f(x) = lim
x→1−(2x2 + 3Ax + B) = 2(1)2 + 3A(1) + B = 2 + 3A + B
The right-hand limit
lim
x→1+ f(x) = lim
x→1+ 4 = 4
For the limit to exist, the right- and left-hand limits must exist and be equal. Thus,
lim
x→1 f(x) = 2 + 3A + B = 4
or
3A + B
=
2
(3.2)
(b) The function will be deﬁned at x = 1 since f(1) = 2(1)2 + 3A(1) + B = 2 + 3A + B
For continuity at both x = −1 and x = 1, we solve Equations (3.1) and (3.2) simultane-
ously. Thus,
A
=

4
B

For this choice of A and B it can easily be shown that

x→1 f(x)
=
4 = f(1) and
lim
x→−1 f(x)
=
−1
2 = f(−1)
so that all three conditions are satisﬁed at both x = 1 and x = −1, and function f is
continuous at both x = 1 and x = −1. Therefore, function f is continuous for all values
of x if
A = 3

f(x) =



e−1
x2 ,
if x ̸= 0
0,
if x = 0
First describe f using functional composition. Let g(x) = −1
x2 and h(x) = ex. Function
h is well-known to be continuous for all values of x.
Function g is the quotient of functions continuous for all values of x, and is therefore
continuous for all values of x except x = 0, that x which makes the denominator zero.
Thus, for all values of x except x = 0,
f(x) = h(g(x)) = eg(x) = e−1
x2
is a continuous function (the functional composition of continuous functions).
Now check for continuity of f at x = 0. Function f is deﬁned at x = 0 since
(a) The limit
lim
x→0
−1
x2 = −1
0+ = −∞
The numerator approaches −1 and the denominator is a positive number approaching
zero.
so that
lim
x→0 f(x) = lim
x→0 e−1/x2 = e−∞=
”1”
e∞=
”1”
∞= 0
i.e.,
lim
x→0 f(x) = 0
(b)
f(0) = 0
(c)
lim
x→0 f(x) = 0 = f(0)
all three conditions are satisﬁed, and f is continuous at x = 0. Thus, f is continuous for
all values of x.

Let f be continuous at a point x = a in the domain of f and let g be
continuous at a point f(a) in its domain. Then the composite function gof is continuous
at x = a.

CHAPTER 3. CONTINUITY OF FUNCTIONS
3.1.1
Removable discontinuity
There are discontinuities which can be removed by redeﬁning the function.
Deﬁnition 3.1.2
If L−and L+ at x0 exist, are ﬁnite, and are equal to L = L−= L+.
Then, if f(x0) is not equal to L, x0 is called a removable discontinuity. This discontinuity
can be ”removed to make f continuous at x0”.
Removable discontinuity ≡A hole in a graph.
That is, a discontinuity that can be
”repaired” by ﬁlling in a single point. In other words, a removable discontinuity is a point
at which a graph is not connected but can be made connected by ﬁlling in a single point.
Example 3.1.30
Show that the function
f(x)
=
x2 −9
x −3
Is discontinuous at x = 3
Checking through conditions of continuity, we have for f(x) = x2−9
x−3
⇒
f(3) = 0
0 is not
deﬁned . Hence f(x) must be discontinuous at x = 3.
But since the
lim
x→3 f(x)
=
lim
x→3
x2 −9
x −3

= lim
x→3
(x + 3)(x −3)
x −3
= 6 exists
and for continuity of f(x) at x = 3
lim
x→3 f(x) = f(3)
Thus if we redeﬁne f(x) at x = 3 we can remove the discontinuity at x = 3. In fact if
f(x) = 6 at x = 3, then the function becomes continuous at x = 3 i.e
f(x) =



x2−9
x−3 ,
x ̸= 3
6,
x = 3
is continuous at x = 3
Such discontinuity which can be removed by redeﬁning the function at the discontinuity
are called removable discontinuities
DDW, GIM, JMK, Calculus I: Lecture Notes

CHAPTER 3. CONTINUITY OF FUNCTIONS
Example 3.1.31
Redeﬁne the function
f(x)
=
1 −cos2 x
sin x
so that it is continuous at x = 0
Since
lim
x→0
1 −cos2 x
sin x

=
lim
x→0
sin2 x
sin x = lim
x→0(sin x) = 0
f(x) to be continuous at x = 0,
lim
x→x0 f(x) = f(x0)
⇒
f(0) = lim
x→0 f(x)
Therefore if we redeﬁne f(0) = 0 i.e
f(x) =



(1−cos2 x
sin x ),
x ̸= 0
0,
x = 0
then f(x) is continuous at x = 0.
Example 3.1.32
Redeﬁne the function
f(x) = x2 −5x + 6
(x −2)
so that it is continuous at x = 2.
The function is not deﬁned at x = 2. The function is continuous if
f(2) = lim
x→2 f(x) = lim
x→2
x2 −5x + 6
(x −2)
= lim
x→2
(x −2)(x −3)
(x −2)
= lim
x→2(x −3) = −1
Thus the redeﬁned continuous function is
f(x) =



x2−5x+6
(x−2) ,
if x ̸= 2
−1,
if x = 2
Such discontinuity is termed as removable discontinuity.

Jump discontinuity
Deﬁnition 3.1.3
The limits L−and L+ exist and are ﬁnite, but not equal. Then, x0
is called a jump discontinuity or step discontinuity. For this type of discontinuity, the
function f may have any value in x0.
Example 3.1.34 Consider the function




x2

0

CHAPTER 3. CONTINUITY OF FUNCTIONS
3.1.3
Essential discontinuity
Deﬁnition 3.1.4
One or both of the limits L−and L+ does not exist or is inﬁnite.
Then, x0 is called an essential discontinuity, or inﬁnite discontinuity.

Then, the point x0 = 1 is an essential discontinuity (sometimes called inﬁnite discontinu-
ity).
For it to be an essential discontinuity, it would have suﬃced that only one of the two
one-sided limits did not exist or were inﬁnite.
However, given this example the discontinuity is also an essential discontinuity for the
extension of the function into complex variables.

Formal deﬁnition of continuity of function f(x) at x = a
Deﬁnition 3.1.5 A function f(x) is continuous at x = a if and only if given ϵ > 0 there
exists δ > 0 such that |f(x) −f(a)| < ϵ whenever |x −a| < δ
Example 3.1.36
Prove that
f(x) = (3x + 5)
is continuous at x = 10. Begin by letting ϵ > 0 be given. Find δ > 0 (which depends on
ϵ) so that if |x −10| ≤δ, then |f(x) −35| ≤ϵ.
Begin with |f(x) −35| and ”solve for” |x −10|. Then
|f(x) −35|
=
|(3x + 5) −35|
=
|3x −30|
=
|3(x −10)|
≤
|3||(x −10)|
≤
3|x −10|
≤
ϵ
iﬀ
|x −10| ≤ϵ
3
Now choose δ = ϵ
3.
Thus if |x −10| ≤ϵ
3, that is δ ≤ϵ
3, it follows that |f(x) −35| ≤ϵ. This completes the
proof.

Continuity at end points of domain
We say that a function is continuous at a left endpoint α of its domain if,

Intermediate Value Theorem, IVT
Theorem 3.2.1
Let f be continuous on the closed interval [a, b] with f(a) ̸= f(b). Let
d be any number between f(a) and f(b). Then there exists at least one number c ∈(a, b)
with f(c) = d.
All that this theorem says is that a continuous function cannot skip any number in pasing
from any of its values to another. The IV T is an existence theorem. It guarantees the
existence of the number c, though it does not say how to ﬁnd it.
It also guarantees that a continuous function cannot change sign without becoming zero
at some point, that is, if a continuous function g has positive and negative values for some
two points on an interval, then there exists a point c in the interval at which g(c) = 0.
Example 3.2.1
Show that the function f(x) = x2 −4 has a roots between −3 and −1
and also between 1 and 3.
A root of f is a number x for which f(x) = 0. Now f(−3) = 5 and f(−1) = −3. Since
0 ∈[−3, 5], by the IVT there exists a number c ∈(−3, −1) such that f(c) = 0.
Similarry A root of f is a number x for which f(x) = 0. Now f(1) = −3 and f(3) = 5.
Since 0 ∈[−3, 5], by the IVT (We can use the theorem since f(x) is a continuous function
everywhere) there exists a number c ∈(1, 3) such that f(c) = 0.
Example 3.2.2
Show that the function f(x) = 4x3 −6x2 + 3x −2 has a root between
1 and 2.
A root of f is a number x for which f(x) = 0. Now f(1) = −1 and f(2) = 12. Since
0 ∈[−1, 12], by the IVT there exists a number c ∈(1, 2) such that f(c) = 0.
Example 3.2.3
If a child grows from 1m to 1.5m between the ages of 2 years and 6
years, then, at some time between 2 years and 6 years of age, the child’s height must have
been 1.25m.
Example 3.2.4
Show that the function f(x) = ln(x) −1 has a solution in [2, 3].
Example 3.2.5
Show that the function f(x) = x5 + 2x3 + x −5 has only one real
solution. Hint: Use x = 1 and x = 2
Example 3.2.6
Use the Intermediate Value Theorem to show that there is a positive
number c such that c2 = 2.
Let f(x) = x2. Then f is continuous and f(0) = 0 < 2 < 4 = f(2). By the IVT there is
c ∈(0, 2) such that c2 = f(c) = 2.
Example 3.2.7
If f(x) = x3 −x2 + x, show that there is c ∈R such that f(c) = 10.
But f(1) = 1 and f(3) = 33 −32 + 3 = 27 −9 + 3 = 21, so f(0) < 10 < f(3). Since f is
continuous everywhere, there must be c ∈R such that f(c) = 10.
Example 3.2.8
Let f be a continuous function on [0, 1]. Show that if −1 ≤f(x) ≤1
for all x ∈[0, 1] then there is c ∈[0, 1] such that [f(c)]2 = c.
If f(x) is continuous on [0, 1] then so is [f(x)]2. Set g(x) = [f(x)]2 −x. Then g is also
continuous on [0, 1]. Now g(0) = [f(0)]2 −0 = [f(0)]2 ≥0 and g(1) = [f(1)]2 −1 ≤0, so
by IVT there is c ∈[0, 1] such that g(c) = 0. Then [f(c)]2 −c = 0 or [f(c)]2 = c.

Fixed point Theorem
Theorem 3.3.1
Let f : [0, 1] →[0, 1] be a continuous function. Then there is at least
one number c that is ﬁxed by f, that is, for which
f(c) = c
Deﬁnition 3.3.1
In mathematics, a ﬁxed point (sometimes shortened to ﬁx point, also
known as an invariant point) of a function is a point that is mapped to itself by the
function. A set of ﬁxed points is sometimes called a ﬁxed set.
Example 3.3.1
For example, if f is deﬁned on the real numbers by
f(x) = x2 −3x + 4,
then 2 is a ﬁxed point of f, because f(2) = 2.
f(c)

p

The point c = 2 is the ﬁxed point for the function f(x) = x2 −3x + 4
Example 3.3.2
Find the ﬁxed points for the continuous function
f(x) = (x + 1)

f(c)
=
c
(c + 1)
2
=
c
c + 1
=
2c
c
=
1
Since c = 1 ∈[−1, 1], c = 1 is a ﬁxed point.

CHAPTER 3. CONTINUITY OF FUNCTIONS
Example 3.3.3
Find all the ﬁxed points for the function

c2 −c −6
=
0
c
=
1 ±
p
1 + 4(1)(6)
2(1)
= −2, 3
Thus the points c = −2 and c = 3 are the ﬁxed points of f(x) = x2−6 since −2, 3 ∈[−4, 4]
Example 3.3.4
Find all the ﬁxed points for the function
f(x) = x2 −2x + 2
in the closed interval [−6, 1]
For a ﬁxed point
f(c)
=
c
c2 −2c + 2
=
c
c2 −3c + 2
=
0
c
=
1, 2
Thus the point c = 1 is a ﬁxed point but c = 2 is not a ﬁxed point of f(x) = x2 −2x + 2
since 1 ∈[−6, 1] but 2 ̸∈[−6, 1]
Example 3.3.5
A continuous function that maps [0, 1] into itself has a ﬁxed point.

A continuous function that maps a disk into itself has a ﬁxed point.

A continuous function that maps a spherical ball into itself necessarily
has a ﬁxed point.

(a) We say that L is the limit of f(x) as x approaches a if for every ϵ > 0 (however
small but positive) there exists a corresponding δ > 0 also dependent on ϵ such that
|f(x) −L| < ϵ whenever |x −a| < δ.

e(i) We say that a function f(x) is continuous at x = a if
(i) the lim
x→a f(x) exists ie lim
x→a−f(x) = lim
x→a+ f(x)
(ii) the functional value f(a) exists.
(iii) limx→a f(x) = f(a)
OR
A function f(x) is continuous at x = a if and only if given ϵ > 0 there exists δ > 0
such that |f(x) −f(a)| < ϵ whenever 0 ≤|x −a| < δ
(ii) Let f(x) = x2−9
x−3
(ii1) Since f(x) is not deﬁned at x = 3, then is discontinuous at that point.
(ii2) Using limits
lim
x→3
x2 −9
x −3
=
lim
x→3
(x −3)(x + 3)
x −3
= lim
x→3(x + 3) = 6
f(x) =



x2−9
x−3 ,
x ̸= 3
6,
x = 3
(f)
lim
x→2−f(x)
=
23 = 8
and
lim
x→2+
=
10(2) = 20
since
lim
x→2−f(x)
̸=
lim
x→2+
The limit does not exist, thus the function is not continuous.
