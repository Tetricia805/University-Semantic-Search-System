ABSTRACT 
The research is about exploring the perceptions and practices of Ugandan SMES in 
Kabale municipality regarding social media for brand boosting. The objectives of the 
study were identifying the social media platforms most commonly used by Ugandan 
SMEs for brand building, analyze the strategies and practices employed by Ugandan 
SMEs to enhance their brand image and engagement on social media, identify the 
main challenges faced by Ugandan SMEs in utilizing social media for brand boosting 
and understand how Ugandan SMEs measure the effectiveness of their social media 
efforts in terms of brand building. 
 The research employed a descriptive case study approach to qualitatively 
investigate how chosen SMEs in Kabale Municipality utilize social media for brand 
enhancement, incorporating both primary and secondary information sources. The 
target population included SME owners, social media managers, and customers in 
Kabale Municipality. Purposeful sampling was applied to select 20 SMEs that actively 
participate in social media branding. Interview guides facilitated the collection of 
qualitative data from SME managers and marketers, while focus group discussions 
(FGDs) were held with SME staff and social media followers to gain insights into their 
shared perceptions and experiences concerning SME branding strategies on social 
media. 
During a focus group discussion with SME employees and social media followers in 
Kabale Municipality, they indicated that Facebook was the predominant platform for 
brand development

CHAPTER ONE. INTRODUCTION 
1.0 Introduction  
The chapter provides the following subsections of information on the title, 
introduction, background, problem statement, research objectives and questions; 
scope, justification of the study, its significance as well as the theoretical framework. 
1.1 Background to the Study 
Most SMEs quantitatively tracked the effectiveness of social media by counting 
increases in followers, likes, comments, and shares. While those provided at least some 
level of brand attention and interaction insight, they were deficient in depicting 
additional audience action or sales impact. Customer ratings and testimonies generated 
qualitative information but were not formally summarized into performance analysis. 
Physical signals such as sales leads that were linked with social media campaigns used 
to be the ultimate sign of brand success, and systematic monitoring systems were 
unheard of. The intermittent usage of licensed analytics software such as Facebook 
Insights was due to limited availability, expertise, and time. This didn't allow SMEs to 
think of optimization of campaigns or return on investment. 
Despite these challenges, SMEs expressed interest in building more data literacy and 
analysis capability. Internal most critical monitoring practices were in the process of 
undergoing changes but were not quite there yet. This means an in-between state in 
which SMEs realize the importance of measurement but lack adequate capability for 
full implementation. Filling this gap is critical for future success in digital marketing.

Additionally, the entrepreneurial activities of young Africans are increasingly reliant on 
social media platforms, making digital branding a transformation for the generation. 
Young entrepreneurs are launching fashion, art, and food brands solely online through 
Instagram and TikTok (Ndyali, 2018). These platforms facilitate real-time storytelling, 
visual promotions, and customer testimonials—crucial for building brand trust. A study 
by Boateng (2019) showed that young African entrepreneurs view social media not just 
as a marketing tool but as an essential element of their business strategy. Even though 
large corporations dominate traditional media, small and medium-sized enterprises are 
finding a level playing field through social networks. The gradual democratization of 
marketing power is changing Africa’s business landscape. Understanding these trends is 
essential for developing tailored strategies for small businesses in local environments. 
In East Africa, social media has emerged as a transformative SME marketing and 
branding tool. The digital entrepreneurship sector in Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda has 
grown remarkably, primarily due to youth and mobile access to the Internet (Mutuku & 
Odhiambo, 2020). More than 80% of small and medium-sized Kenyan enterprises utilize 
at least a single social media platform for marketing, as indicated by a report by the 
Kenya National Bureau of Statistics in 2019. WhatsApp and Facebook have emerged as 
favorites given the large network of users and the low cost. Small and medium-sized 
organisations in Tanzania use WhatsApp groups and Insta Stories for product promotion 
and receiving orders immediately (Ndiege, 2019). The use of these platforms is 
transforming conventional marketing practices and generating new brand development 
prospects. Nevertheless, numerous SME operators in the region still do not possess 
sophisticated technical expertise and digital policy. 

3 
 
In Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi, there is increased use of social media for branding, 
albeit at a slow level due to infrastructure and education challenges. In Uganda, small 
and medium entities have taken to Facebook to market local crafts, fashion, and 
services more and more (Kalemera, 2018). A survey by Kira Digital Uganda in 2020 
established that 60% of SMEs using social media recorded improved awareness of 
customers on products. Nevertheless, issues like absence of social media training, 
absence of brand management expertise, and irregular online participation were noted. 
In Rwanda, the government drives digital inclusion by ICT policies promoting SMEs 
(Rwabizambuga, 2018). Such community initiatives have a bright outlook for the use of 
social media, but issues arise hindering total success in enhancing brand visibility. 
Furthermore, throughout East Africa, youth-run centers are rising to assist SMEs in 
digital branding expertise. The likes of Nairobi Garage, The Innovation Village in 
Uganda, and BongoHive in Zambia provide workshops on how to enhance a brand with 
digital means (Muchira, 2018). The centers have provided an environment from which 
even small undertakings are able to create professional brands and compete in the 
digital marketplace. Studies by Turyakira and Mbidde (2019) indicated that SMEs 
embracing digital models in East Africa showed improved access to markets and greater 
customer loyalty. Social media has connected the remotest regions, allowing 
undertakings in isolated regions to participate in urban and global markets. As the 
region adopts digital evolution, more SMEs are adjusting business models to incorporate 
online branding models. The trend presents a change in marketing momentum in the 
region due to digital connectivity 

4 
 
In Uganda, SME usage of social media has progressively risen in the last five years with 
rising mobile phone ownership and urbanization. In 2019, Uganda Communications 
Commission (UCC) indicated that more than 18 million Ugandans utilized the internet, 
and Facebook and WhatsApp were the most utilized platforms. The platforms have 
emerged as indispensable for SMEs to market offers, interact with consumers, and 
enhance visibility. Nakirya and Lwanga (2020) state that social media enables Ugandan 
SMEs to create brand awareness without the expenditure of print and radio marketing. 
The majority of the companies use informal marketing, and utilizing social media is a 
hassle-free option. Not many SMEs have well-formed branding policies and continuous 
online interactions. The situation has generated a disconnect between digital branding's 
promise and its real impact in Uganda. 
Urbans SMEs in cities such as Kampala, Mbarara, and Gulu have more use of social media 
for branding than SMEs in rural locations. The disparity is explained by better access to 
the internet, improved digital literacy, and more access to smartphones (Kasozi & 
Lubega, 2019). In Kampala restaurants and fashion houses use Instagram to display 
product images and respond to customers' queries. WhatsApp status updates and 
Facebook pages provide platforms for collections of products, client ratings, and brand 
messages. A study by Mpiima (2018) indicated that SMEs using social media recorded a 
20–30% increase in inquiries and interaction from customers. Though such interaction 
rose sharply, few SMEs have branding efforts or measure success using analytics. This 
makes the use of social media less effective in the long term for building brands. 
Uganda's ministry of ICT started programs on digital skill training for small business 
enterprise leaders, but uptake remains low among SME establishments. The majority of 

5 
 
the training programs are donor-initiated and have weak linkage with local business-
development plans (Wamala, 2019). Additionally, the costs of using the internet and 
cybersecurity challenges inhibit many small business establishments from complete use 
of online branding. Lack of understanding of branding basics contributes to inconsistent 
messages, uninspiring visual aspects, and limited customer interaction. As a result, 
although universal access exists for the use of social media, strategic use of such for 
enhancing brand visibility remains low among urban SME establishments such as those 
established in Kampala, Mbarara, and Gulu. The urban-rural disparity results from 
better access to the internet, improved digital literacy, and access to smartphones 
(Kasozi & Lubega, 2019). In Kampala city, restaurants and fashion houses utilize 
Instagram for posting product photographs and customers' responses. WhatsApp's use of 
status and Facebook pages give avenues for products lists and customers and brand 
ratings and brand updates. Studies by Mpiima (2018) indicated SME establishments using 
social media achieving a 20–30% increase in questions and responses from customers. 
Despite such an increase, few SME establishments use branding methodologies or check 
performance using analytics. The latter makes the use of social media less effective as 
a sustainable brand-development tool. 
Uganda's Ministry of ICT has started training small business operators on digital skills, 
but SME uptake is not significant. Training programs offered have mostly been 
influenced by donors and do not harmonize well with national plans of business 
development (Wamala, 2019). Besides, expenditure on use of the internet and 
cybersecurity issues deters many small operators from adopting fully online branding. 
Incorrect comprehension of branding basics takes the form of inconsistent 
communication, poor visual elements, and poor customer involvement. Hence, 

6 
 
strategic utilisation for improvement of brand visibility with high penetration of social 
media isn't fully realized. SME operators in Uganda need assistance on social media 
strategy, content, and brand position for more effectiveness. Such measures are critical 
in transforming awareness into loyalty and driving sustainable business expansion 
In Kabale Municipality, SMEs have increasingly adopted use of social media but it is 
mostly informal and not well researched. Most business entities such as salons, tailoring 
shops, and mobile money agents utilize WhatsApp statuses and Facebook groups to 
advertise services (Turyatunga, 2020). Lack of well-developed branding and quality 
production of content however hampers effective brand positioning. The vast majority 
of SMEs rely on word of mouth or posters inside shops, occasionally using social media. 
Digital marketing is perceived more as an alternative resource rather than a genuine 
investment. The low usage of Instagram and Twitter implies local SMEs have not yet 
utilized the various outlets of social media at their disposal. The opportunity for further 
analysis of local tradition and challenges is made. 
Young people in Kabale have been at the vanguard of innovative use of social media, 
specifically in business sectors like fashion, entertainment, and smallholder agriculture. 
The proprietors of small business use smartphones and low-cost plans for chat and 
negotiating with customers inside and outside the city (Byamukama, 2019). Facebook 
pages and WhatsApp groups are used extensively to market second-hand clothing, 
crafts, and phone accessories. However, the vast majority of business establishments 
suffer from the inability to have steady branding and working models of customer 
interaction. Surveys of business proprietors in Kabale reflect the desire to utilize social 
media more efficiently; however, a lack of skill, facilitation, and training impedes it. 

7 
 
Most business entities also lack logos, taglines, and histories of brand that would attract 
online visibility. Therefore, education on branding is appropriate for the local setting 
and critical. 
Kabale's standing as a growing urban center and access to education services and 
potential for tourism offers SMEs an untapped market on social media. Firms with target 
groups of students at the university or tourist clientele have potential for successful 
digital brand campaigns (Tumwesigye, 2018). Infrastructure setbacks like slow network 
connectivity and inconsistent power supply remain hindrances. Partnerships among 
local government and SMEs for digital literacy and innovation hubs remain limited. 
Improving support systems may enable SMEs in Kabale to leverage more on social media 
for brand improvement. Research plays a crucial role in assessing current practices, 
attitudes, and potential responses. This study shall fill the knowledge gap and increase 
SME potential by harnessing platforms on social media effectively 
1.2 Problem Statement 
Over the past few years, social media has become a critical means of brand expansion 
for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) worldwide. 
In Uganda, especially in urban centers like Kabale Municipality, increasing use of mobile 
phones and internet connectivity have created additional avenues for SMEs to utilize 
social media platforms like Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram to promote their 
businesses. Despite the convenience of access to these platforms, most SMEs in Kabale 
fail to leverage social media in a way that fosters sustainable brand growth. While some 
businesses post advertisements online from time to time, few businesses embark on 
sustained, strategic branding that builds customer loyalty, market visibility, or 

8 
 
competitiveness. Low digital capabilities, poor branding competency, low levels of 
access to affordable training, and inadequate infrastructure constrain SMEs' complete 
adoption of social media marketing. In addition, there is limited empirical work that 
examines the attitudes of SMEs in Kabale regarding the use of social media and how 
they incorporate it into their business models. With this information unavailable, SMEs 
might not understand the competitive strengths provided by digital branding. The 
absence of properly structured support mechanisms and policy guidelines holds SMEs 
back from realizing the full potentials of social media websites. It intends to explore 
the perspectives and behaviors of Ugandan SMEs operating in Kabale Municipality 
towards the use of social media for brand promotion. It will establish gaps in knowledge, 
skills, and practices and provide insights to be utilized in capacity building, policy 
development, and facilitation of local digital entrepreneurship. It is important to 
understand these dynamics to enable SMEs to enhance their brands, grow their 
customer base, and compete in the online market effectively  
1.3 Purpose of the Study 
To explore the perceptions of Ugandan SMEs regarding the role of social media in 
brand boosting in Kabale Municipality.  
1.4 Objectives of the Study 
The study was guided by the following objectives: 
1. 
To identify the social media platforms most commonly used by Ugandan SMEs for 
brand building in Kabale Municipality. 
2. 
To analyze the strategies and practices employed by Ugandan SMEs to enhance 
their brand image and engagement on social media in Kabale Municipality. 

9 
 
3. 
To identify the main challenges faced by Ugandan SMEs in utilizing social media 
for brand boosting in Kabale Municipality. 
4. To understand how Ugandan SMEs measure the effectiveness of their social media 
efforts in terms of brand building. 
1.5 Research Questions  
1.        What social media platforms are most commonly used by Ugandan SMEs for 
brand building, and why? 
2.        What are the key strategies and practices employed by Ugandan SMEs to

4. How do Ugandan SMEs measure the effectiveness of their social media efforts in 
terms of brand building? 
1.6 Scope of the Study 
1.6.1 Geographical Scope 
         This research took place in Kabale Municipality, which is situated in Kabale 
District in the southwestern region of Uganda. The municipality consists of three 
primary divisions: Central, Northern, and Southern, each featuring an increasing 
number of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) involved in various sectors including 
retail, hospitality, services, and small-scale manufacturing. Kabale Municipality has 
been chosen because of its rising urban development, increasing internet access, and 
the heightened use of smartphones by business operators. The results from this domain 

10 
 
will shed light on how SMEs in semi-urban areas of Uganda utilize social media for brand 
growth 
1.6.2 Content Scope 
          The research was concentrated on recognizing the social media platforms 
predominantly used by Ugandan SMEs for brand development, examining the strategies 
and methods adopted by Ugandan SMEs to improve their brand image and interaction 
on social media, identifying the primary obstacles encountered by Ugandan SMEs in 
leveraging social media for brand enhancement, and understanding how Ugandan SMEs 
evaluate the success of their social media initiatives concerning brand development 
1.6.3. Time Scope 
        The study examined the timeframe from 2017 to 2024, focusing on how SMEs have 
used social media for brand marketing throughout these years. This period is chosen as 
it encompasses important advancements like enhanced internet accessibility, greater 
smartphone adoption, and the transition to online business methods prompted by the 
COVID-19 outbreak. Data will be gathered, analyzed, and reported from March to July 
2025, offering a prompt evaluation of existing trends and practices regarding social 
media use among SMEs 
1.7 Significance of the Study 
This study was significant to various stakeholders.  
For business managers and marketing professionals, it may offer empirical 
evidence on how social media can be harnessed for brand promotion.  
For academia, the study would contribute to the growing body of knowledge on 
digital branding in developing countries.  

11 
 
Policymakers and communication strategists would also benefit from the findings 
as they design support systems for media development in rural areas.  
Additionally, the study would serve as a reference for future researchers interested in 
media, marketing, and digital communication. 
1.8 Theoretical Framework 
         This study was guided by the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) developed by 
Davis (1989). TAM is often used to explain how individuals and organizations embrace 
and implement new technologies. The model suggests that two important factors 
influence technology adoption: Perceived Usefulness (PU) and Perceived Ease of Use 
(PEOU). 
              Perceived Usefulness reflects the extent to which SME owners and managers 
believe that using social media will enhance their brand visibility, customer 
engagement, and ultimately, overall business success. If they consider social media an 
effective tool for promotion and boosting their brand, they are more likely to adopt it. 
          Perceived Ease of Use refers to how straightforward SME owners view the 
utilization of social media platforms like Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Twitter. 
When social media tools are easy to grasp and use, SMEs are more inclined to integrate 
them into their branding strategies. 
            This theory is pertinent to this study as it elucidates the factors influencing 
SMEs in Kabale Municipality in their decision to adopt or forgo social media for brand 
enhancement. TAM will guide the investigation of how perceptions regarding the 
usefulness and user-friendliness of social media affect real usage behaviors. It also 
provides a framework for understanding the challenges SMEs face, such as lack of digital 
skills or limited internet access, which may affect their use of social media tools. 

12 
 
         Utilizing TAM, the study will investigate the relationship between SME owners' 
views on social media and their adoption behaviors, providing insights for improving 
digital marketing engagement to foster brand growth in this area.

CHAPTER TWO.LITERETURE REVIEW 
2.0 Introduction 
        This chapter offers a critical examination of current literature aimed at 
understanding Ugandan SMEs' views on the impact of social media in enhancing brand 
visibility. The assessment is structured according to the particular goals of the study. It 
starts by identifying the social media platforms predominantly utilized by Ugandan SMEs 
for brand development, examines the strategies and techniques adopted by Ugandan 
SMEs to improve their brand perception and interaction on social media, recognizes the 
primary difficulties encountered by Ugandan SMEs in leveraging social media for brand 
enhancement, and explores how Ugandan SMEs assess the impact of their social media 
initiatives in relation to brand development 
2.1. Identifying the social media platforms most commonly used by Ugandan SMEs 
for brand building. 
Nakirya and Lwanga (2020) assert that Facebook remains the primary platform for 
Ugandan SMEs in brand visibility and customer interaction. The ease of use, 
affordability, and entertaining functionalities make it ideal for promoting products and 
services. Ugandan SMEs commonly create Facebook pages to display products, place 
advertisements, and interact with customer responses. The site supports multimedia 
aspects such as pictures and videos and makes brand presentation easier. The boosted 
posts help business entities reach target groups at an affordable price. Facebook 
facilitates direct message, and interaction for clients and business entities increases. 
Therefore, it remains the best social network for SMEs in Uganda. 

14 
 
Boateng (2018) mentions that in Ghana, small and mediumsized enterprises across 
West Africa make widespread use of WhatsApp because of its ease of use and efficiency 
in providing direct communication. SMEs utilize WhatsApp statuses, broadcast lists, and 
groups for announcing product information and receiving immediate responses from 
customers. The informal but efficient marketing route keeps personal connections alive 
with customers for business houses. This is best suited to home-based and micro-
businesses working on limited budgets. WhatsApp establishes brand faith and loyalty by 
providing steady and entertaining updates. This holds good in Uganda, where numerous 
SMEs depend on WhatsApp as a key branding device. It provides marketing and 
communication in a seamless package. 
Kalemera (2018) found that urban SMEs in Uganda, particularly those involved in 
fashion, events, and beauty, use Instagram extensively. The platform supports 
customized visual branding, appealing more to those interested in trend-based content 
and younger demographics. Companies use Instagram stories, highlights, and reels to 
showcase products in an interactive manner and create curiosity. Regular uploaders of 
interesting visuals by entrepreneurs build stronger brand identities. The platform also 
supports cooperation with influencers, and small business establishments benefit from 
expanding the scope of audience reach. Though not popular in rural areas, Instagram 
has started to penetrate business minds equipped with technology. The platform is 
revolutionizing the branding landscape for business houses targeted at youth in Uganda. 
Ndiege and Kimathi (2020) report that in Kenya, Instagram has become central to 
brand small and medium business formations in cities, particularly those targeting 
aspirational lifestyles. The visual-based concept of the platform fosters creativity and 

15 
 
narrative and allows SMEs to differentiate themselves from competitions. Most Kenyan 
SMEs utilize Instagram in building a harmonious and engaging brand story. The 
connection between Facebook and Instagram makes it easier for marketing efforts to 
utilize both platforms. The regional trend manifests in Uganda, wherein the use of 
Instagram has been more intentional. The platform allows small and medium business 
formations to emphasize style, distinctiveness, and identity. The platform plays a 
significant role in the visual brand evolution of East Africa. 
Mutebi and Ssewanyana (2021) state that although not utilized extensively by SMEs 
in Uganda, YouTube offers an increasing opportunity for SMEs that have the potential of 
creating video content. On YouTube, agribusiness SMEs, trainees, and service providers 
upload tutorials, customers, and product offerings. The massive platform creates more 
engagement and building of credibility over time. Despite that, issues of high costs of 
data, inadequate video editing expertise, and poor equipment set limitations for wider 
acceptance. Businesses investing on YouTube aim at creating dedicated crowds. The 
value is in thorough branding and building. 
Appel et al. (2020) indicated that SME branding across the globe has been 
transformed by TikTok by enabling quick, interactive, and occasionally viral content. In 
Nigeria, Indonesia, and India, small and medium business utilize TikTok to make their 
brands more personalized using music, comedy, and storytelling. The fact that its 
algorithm enables mass audiences to be reached by small business within a short period 
of time makes it feasible. Though relatively new in Uganda, numerous youth-oriented 
small and medium business in fashion, music, and entertainment have begun 
considering the platform. The platform provides room for raw expressions and casual 

16 
 
brand building. The platform provides great potential for small and medium business 
that have the potential of creating content innovatively. It is bound to grow in Uganda's 
digital landscape 
2.2 The strategies and practices employed by Ugandan SMEs to enhance their 
brand image and engagement on social media 
interaction on social media 
Cite Qalati et al. (2022), SMEs in Pakistan enhance brand engagement by choosing 
platforms that fit business objectives and customer conduct. Ensuring platform 
compatibility ensures that content interacts with users without losing consistent 
branding. Companies adjust the type of content to fit the individual strength of each 
platform—images for Instagram, messages for WhatsApp, and Facebook stories. SMEs in 
Uganda choose platforms based on their industry and market. For instance, clothing 
business prefer Instagram, but shops use Facebook for promotions. This specific 
platform application ensures efficient brand communication. Additionally, it increases 
audience penetration and enhances customer loyalty. 
Chukwudi et al. (2021) emphasize that in Nigeria, digital training supports SMEs in 
efficiently using social media for brand promotion. SMEs possessing knowledge of social 
media marketing produce better material, schedule better, and engage more 
meaningfully with followers. Customer engagement and brand confidence increase. 
Analogous patterns are shown by Ugandan SMEs, where training enhances brand 
uniformity and flexiblility. Image editing, caption creation, and scheduling of posts 
operate as principal enablers. As SMEs improve digital skills, they graduate from 

17 
 
haphazard posting to systematic branding. Learning is a principal competence for digital 
brand expansion in numerous African contexts. 
Bruce et al. (2023) in South Africa identified that applying user-generated content 
(UGC) and brand-generated content (BGC) establishes sustainable relationships with 
customers. UGC increases reliability, but BGC guarantees message consistency and 
control. SMEs showing customer images, ratings, and case histories increase social proof 
and believability. Ugandan SMEs have engaged similarly, especially in events and 
cosmetics. When customers see other people using a brand, influence and credibility 
increase. The application of UGC and planned content establishes a consistent brand 
image. The technique sustains attention among different customer groups. 
Wang et al. (2025) in China explain how SMEs utilize multi-platform strategy to 
target particular demographics with particular content. Facebook creates awareness, 
for instance, visual appeal is used by Instagram, and viral engagement by TikTok. Such 
diversification establishes brand awareness at points of customer interaction. Ugandan 
SMEs exhibit such a trend in the deployment of direct communication on WhatsApp and 
broader advertising on Facebook. Multi-platform synchronization establishes brand 
familiarity and message reinforcement. It minimizes channel dependence. 
It is proclaimed by Muwanguzi and Ngoma (2020) that SMEs from urban areas such 
as Kampala and Mbarara in Uganda reinforce brand image by regularly scheduling 
content and posting using specific themes. Companies having daily or weekly practices 
ensure brand consistency and stay remembered by customers. Calendars facilitate 
coherence of content with seasons, trends, or phases of advertising. The systematic 
nature facilitates memory recall and ensures brand loyalty. SMEs tend to utilize 

18 
 
Facebook's scheduling feature or software by various creators. Regular updation 
establishes trustworthiness, portraying the enterprise as well-organized and 
dependable. Therefore, planning is fundamental to SMEs' brand building in Uganda. 
Nakitende (2023) also points out that SMEs from Uganda often use a community-
based brand approach by using local connections and local identity to connect 
customers on the web. For instance, they use local words, regional aphorisms, or songs 
from the community in messages to make it more personalized. This builds emotional 
bonding and familiarity, especially in rural and sem urban areas. Ugandan SMEs use the 
brand approach on platforms like WhatsApp and Facebook to maintain a "local" brand 
identity. This forms loyalty and repeat interaction. Hence, cultural congruence is 
critical for branding. This enhances credibility and believability among target groups. 
2.3 The main challenges faced by Ugandan SMEs in utilizing social media for brand 
boosting  
              Ugandan SMEs often suffer from limited digital literacy, hindering them from 
using social media efficiently for brand building. A study by Musiime and Mwaipopo 
(2019) indicated that most SMEs lacked the expertise to create engaging content and 
measure digitalmetrics. The limitation of such a constraint is brand inconsistency and 
the opportunity of engaging the audience lost. SMEs in Kenya suffer from hesitance in 
adopting digital marketing due to the lack of adequate training (Munyua & Wamukota, 
2019). SMEs lack efficiency in the use of social media platforms due to limited digital 
expertise. Financing digital literacy programs is critical in helping SMEs enhance online 
brand awareness. 

19 
 
Exorbitant costs for internet and data pose significant challenges for effective social 
media marketing for small and medium business organizations in Uganda. According to 
a report from the Uganda Evaluation Association (2024), inconsistent and expensive 
data affect SMEs from maintaining a steady online presence. The problem manifests in 
Nigeria among SMEs, which face similar challenges concerning access to the internet 
(Akinbode & Ajayi, 2019). The pricey data limits the quantity and quality of online 
content, which affects brand visibility. Affordable and reliable access to the internet 
helps small and mediumsized business entities optimize the use of social media 
platforms. 
Financial constraints also limit Ugandan SMEs from using social media for marketing. 
Mwesigwa et al. (2019) found that many SMEs operate on limited funds, and this 
hampers their capability to perform paid advertising or engage digital marketing 
professionals. This limitation hampers their communication and interaction on various 
platforms of social media. In Indonesia, small and mediumsized enterprises face similar 
financial constraints in conducting digital marketing practices (Sari & Putri, 2021). 
Without adequate funds, SMEs face an inability to compete favorably in the digital 
space. Financial support and affordable digital marketing avenues provide critical 
intervention for SMEs to enhance online brand visibility. 
One of the common problems faced by Ugandan SMEs is the absence of a clear digital 
marketing strategy. Nakibengo (2022) explained that many SMEs engage on social media 
without a clear strategic direction, leading to inconsistent information and failed 
branding. The problem is evident in South Africa, where SMEs have challenges making 
strategic digital marketing plans (Bruce et al., 2023). Lack of a clear strategic direction 

20 
 
results in missed opportunities for connecting with the audience and enhancing the 
brand. The development of in-depth digital marketing plans helps SMEs build a sound 
and consistent brand online presence. 
Security fears halt Ugandan SMEs from fully embracing social media marketing. Babirye 
and Mukama (2022) explained that fears of data hacking and cyber fraud make SMEs 
hesitate in sharing sensitive information or fully participating on online platforms. The 
issue is global; in Europe, small and medium企业 face similar challenges with regard to 
protecting data (Garcia et al., 2020). The issues limit the level of customer 
participation and building confidence on social media. Building effective cybersecurity 
measures and educating SMEs on the security of data can alleviate these fears and 
enable wider online engagement. 
 2.4 Understand how Ugandan SMEs measure the effectiveness of their social 
media efforts in terms of brand building. 
Kato and Namukasa (2021) indicate that many Ugandan SMEs predominantly measure 
social media effectiveness through scrutinizing engagement metrics such as likes, 
comments, shares, and number of followers.     
Such quantitative measures provide insight into the audience engagement and help 
firms to decide on which content performs most effectively. While engagement figures 
can be accessed via such platform analytics platforms as Facebook Insights, SMEs 
struggle to convert engagement into measurable brand growth. This is also the case in 
Kenya, whereby SMEs rely highly on engagement to calculate brand awareness (Wachira 
& Were, 2020). Ugandan SMEs gauge effectiveness by tracking reach and impressions, 
showing how many users see their posts. 

21 
 
Mugisha (2023) confirms that measuring reach enables SMEs to know their existence of 
their brand outside their direct audience. This is especially applicable whenever firms 
spend money on paid advertisements. Firms in South Africa apply the reach statistics 
to measure brand visibility through social media, given that higher reach translates to 
greater raised brand awareness (Botha & Reyneke, 2019). Yet, SMEs tend to be unable 
to hit the balance between reach and substantial engagement. Customer feedback and 
social media ratings offer qualitative performance measures for Ugandan SMEs. 
Nakitende (2022) describes that SMEs closely listen to comments and interactions to 
determine customer opinion and brand image. Favorable comments and referrals are 
seen as proofs of trust and brand loyalty. SMEs utilize this strategy prevalent in Ghana, 
whereby social media discussions are employed to enhance branding strategies (Osei-
Frimpong & McLean, 2018). SMEs are able to modify their communication strategies and 
enhance customer relations through active listening. In Europe, small and medium 
businesses frequently blend quantitative social media metrics with qualitative customer 
feedback to measure brand development. 
Müller and Schmid (2021) of Germany indicate that companies monitor engagement 
rates, reach, and click-throughs while measuring customer sentiment through 
comments and direct messages. 
This integrated method assists SMEs in evaluating brand visibility and audience 
impression.       Likewise, UK SMEs utilize sentiment analysis tools to monitor brand 
performance and fine-tune campaigns in real-time (Smith & Johnson, 2020). European 
SMEs are more likely to incorporate such data into overall marketing strategies to 
provide a consistent brand experience throughout channels. SMEs in most African 
nations such as South Africa significantly utilize social media analytics tools to monitor 

22 
 
their brand performance. Botha and Reyneke (2019) established that South African SMEs 
prefer to make use of Facebook Insights and Google Analytics as social media platforms 
to track follower increase, engagement patterns, and conversion rates. Follower traffic 
from social media websites is utilized by them to measure campaign success. These 
metrics assist SMEs in optimizing content and posting times to enhance brand 
performance. 
Most SMEs continue to struggle with comprehending data and translating it into 
effective branding.             Small and medium business enterprises in Kenya in East 
Africa use both reach measures and customer interaction surveys to determine the 
effectiveness of social media. Wachira and Were (2020) point out that Kenyan SMEs 
track reach and impressions to measure brand visibility and also conduct periodic online 
questionnaires to collect information on customer satisfaction and awareness of the 
brand. The integration enables the companies to better tailor their communication and 
enhance community interaction. In Uganda, too, the same strategies are adopted where 
SMEs leverage a combination of data monitoring with customer direct feedback to build 
brand loyalty and customize content based on audience interest.

CHAPTER THREE. 
RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 
3.0 Introduction 
           This chapter describes the approach employed in the analysis of the knowledge 
and behavior of Ugandan SMEs in Kabale Municipality towards utilizing social media to 
boost their brands. It will describe the research design, location, population, sampling 
procedures, sources of data, variables, process, tools, evaluation of data, ethical 
issues, and limitations of the study. A mixed-method approach was employed to engage 
both qualitative and quantitative paradigms. This approach helped in systematic 
investigation of branding strategies. The selected methods helped effectively address 
the research goals. Academic and ethical standards were maintained throughout the 
entire process 
3.1 Research Design 
        This study employed a descriptive case study method to qualitatively explore how 
specific SMEs in Kabale Municipality utilize social media to improve their branding 
efforts. This design enabled a deep understanding of social media branding methods in 
their true context by focusing on detailed descriptions and interpretations rather than 
numerical analysis. Data was collected exclusively using qualitative methods, especially 
through comprehensive interviews with managers and marketers of SMEs to gain in-
depth understanding of their perspectives, strategies, and challenges, along with focus 
group discussions (FGDs) involving SME employees and followers to explore shared 
experiences and audience opinions about social media engagement. Utilizing open-
ended questions in both methods encouraged comprehensive answers, providing an in-
depth and authentic understanding of social media's impact on SME brand growth. This 

24 
 
purely qualitative approach offered depth and context, avoiding the intricacies and 
time demands of mixed methods, while enhancing the reliability and validity of the 
findings within the case study structure 
3.2 Area of Study 
       The study took place in Kabale Municipality, located in Kabale District, in the 
southwestern region of Uganda. This region was chosen because of its increasing digital 
adoption and the variety of SMEs present. The municipality encompassed both urban 
and peripheral areas, making it ideal for analyzing different social media usage 
behaviors. Numerous companies in Kabale utilize platforms such as Facebook, 
WhatsApp, and Instagram for marketing. The engagement of the local community with 
these platforms offered important perspectives. Kabale’s commercial landscape 
provides a solid basis for investigating brand-oriented activities via social media 
platforms 
3.3 Sources of Information 
         The research employed both primary and secondary data sources. Directly 
collected primary data came from SME owners, their marketing teams, and chosen 
social media followers. These individuals shared personal testimonials regarding their 
activities and experiences. Secondary data comprised scholarly literature, journals, 
governmental reports, and internet articles. These resources offered theoretical and 
contextual backing for the research. Utilizing various data sources will strengthen the 
reliability of the results. It enabled a comparison between recorded practices and 
actual conditions in the field 

25 
 
3.4 Study Population 
         The research population included SME proprietors, social media administrators, 
and clients in Kabale Municipality. The businesses chosen were those that utilize at least 
one social media platform for branding purposes. A total of 20 SMEs were selected for 
involvement. Moreover, 200 social media followers will constitute the larger population. 
These followers showcased the audience engaging with SMEs on the internet. Both SME 
operators and followers will provide valuable perspectives on branding strategies. Their 
perspectives aided in assessing the impact of social media on enhancing brand loyalty 
and visibility. 
3.5   Sampling Techniques 
The research utilized purposive sampling to choose 20 SMEs that are actively involved 
in branding through social media. These companies were selected for their noticeable 
online visibility and regular posting activity. To choose 50 participants for social media 
followers, the study utilized simple random sampling. This method guaranteed variation 
in age, gender, and online habits. The integration of purposive and random sampling 
resulted in a well-rounded dataset. This approach will improve the significance and 
applicability of the results. It also guaranteed equity in the selection of participants. 
3.6 Variables Definition and Measurement 
The independent variable involved social media. It was assessed by analyzing posting 
frequency, content variety, and platform range. The frequency of posting will indicate 
how regularly companies share content on the internet. Content type will indicate if 
posts are promotional, informational, or interactive. The variety of platforms will 
evaluate the count of distinct platforms utilized. The variable that relied on others was 
brand strength. This was assessed through brand recognition, customer involvement, 

26 
 
and allegiance. Every indicator contributed to evaluating the effectiveness of social 
media in enhancing SME brands 
3.7 Procedure for Data Collection 
       The process of collecting data started by securing approval from SME managers and 
pertinent authorities. Participants were made aware of the study's objectives, and their 
permission was secured. Surveys were given to chosen SME employees and supporters. 
Interviews with key informants were arranged with business proprietors and marketers 
to obtain more profound insights. Observations were carried out on the social media 
pages of SMEs. Data gathering occurred over a span of four weeks. The researcher 
retained adaptability to fit the schedules of participants 
3.8 Data Collection Instruments 
Interview Guides 
              Qualitative data was collected from SME managers and marketers using 
interview guides. These guides will include thoughtfully crafted open-ended questions 
that enable participants to articulate their opinions openly and thoroughly. The aim of 
utilizing interview guides was to investigate perceptions, branding tactics, difficulties, 
and evaluation practices concerning the use of social media by SMEs in Kabale 
Municipality. This approach allowed the researcher to obtain comprehensive 
understanding of how decision-makers in SMEs perceive and utilize social media for 
enhancing their brands. Interviews took place in a one-on-one format, creating a 
relaxed atmosphere that promotes transparency and sincerity. The adaptability of semi-
structured interviews enabled the interviewer to pose follow-up questions in response 

27 
 
to participant replies, which assisted in revealing deeper insights and hidden 
motivations. The gathered data was documented and transcribed for thematic analysis. 
Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) 
              Discussions in focus groups (FGDs) took place with employees of SMEs and 
social media followers to understand their collective views and experiences related to 
SME branding tactics on social media. Each focus group had 6 to 10 respondents, 
and the interviews were managed through a series of open-ended structured questions. 
Important focal areas were respondents' perceptions of the social media presence of 
SMEs, popularity of content, their engagement behavior, and the impact of social media 
on purchasing decisions. FGDs allowed for interactive discussion, where respondents 
could elaborate on each other's points and bring out collective issues or 
recommendations. This method demonstrated success in collecting diverse viewpoints, 
comprehending group dynamics, and examining social factors that affect audience 
engagement with SME brands on the internet. The conversations were recorded with 
the consent of the participants and later transcribed for qualitative examination 
3.9 Quality Control 
The study employed several quality control measures to ensure reliable data 
collection. All instruments were pre-tested with a small sample of SMEs and followers 
to identify and correct unclear items. The researcher reviewed completed 
questionnaires daily for errors or inconsistencies. Data was cleaned and double-checked 
before entry into the analysis software. Triangulation was applied by using multiple 
data sources to cross-verify responses. These measures reduced bias and increase data 
accuracy. Every stage was closely monitored to maintain high-quality standards. 

28 
 
3.10 Data Processing and Analysis 
    Following data collection, quantitative information was coded and input into SPSS 
for analysis. Frequencies and percentages as descriptive statistics were utilized to 
encapsulate trends in social media usage and branding results. Cross-tabulations can 
also be used for comparisons. Interview qualitative data was transcribed and 
thematically analyzed. Emerging themes were utilized to capture views, approaches, 
and difficulties. The combined method will incorporate both kinds of data. This offered 
a comprehensive and in-depth perspective on branding practices on social media among 
SMEs. 
After data collection, quantitative data was coded and entered into SPSS for 
analysis. Descriptive statistics such as frequencies and percentages was used to 
summarize patterns of social media use and branding outcomes. Cross-tabulations may 
also be employed for comparisons. Qualitative data from interviews was transcribed 
and analyzed thematically. Emerging themes was used to describe perceptions, 
strategies, and challenges. The mixed-method approach will integrate both types of 
data. This provided a rich and holistic view of social media branding practices among 
SMEs. 
3.11 Ethical Considerations 
            The research adhered to all ethical standards for studies. All participants 
provided informed consent prior to the collection of any data. The aim of the study was 
clearly communicated to the participants. Confidentiality was preserved via coding and 
safe data storage. Participants could exit at any time without facing any repercussions. 
Approval for ethical clearance was requested from relevant authorities. The 

29 
 
investigator guaranteed that no damage—be it physical, emotional, or reputational—
will take place. Participant dignity was upheld consistently during the entire process 
3.12 Limitations of the Study 
Several limitations were expected in the study. 
 Some SME followers may lack digital literacy, which may affect their ability to 
respond clearly to questionnaires. Poor internet access in certain areas of Kabale will 
limit participation from some users.  
Scheduling interviews with SME owners may be difficult due to their business 
commitments. These issues were addressed by simplifying data tools and offering 
flexible scheduling. Triangulation helped fill any data gaps caused by non-responses. 
Despite these constraints, the study will remain focused on delivering reliable and 
meaningful results.

CHAPTER FOUR: 
DATA PRESENTATION, ANALYSIS, AND INTERPRETATION 
4.1 Introduction 
           This chapter presents the findings of the study on how Small and Medium 
Enterprises (SMEs) in Kabale Municipality use social media for brand growth. The data 
collected from interviews, focus group discussions, and observations has been analyzed 
and interpreted in accordance with the study objectives. The findings are organized by 
theme, focusing on social media platforms commonly used by SMEs, brand development 
strategies and practices, challenges faced, and methods for assessing the impact of 
social media. The chapter begins by detailing the demographic characteristics of the 
participants to provide context for the analysis

This educational profile probably enhances the effective use of social media for 
branding of SMEs 
4.3 Social Media Platforms Commonly Used by Ugandan SMEs 
Results from Table 4.5 showed that the majority of participants had completed 
post-secondary education. Forty percent possessed diploma qualifications, 35% earned 
bachelor’s degrees, 15% had certificates, and 10% completed secondary education or 
less. In a discussion with SME staff and social media users in Kabale Municipality, they 
mentioned that Facebook was the most commonly utilized platform for brand 
development. They highlighted that Facebook's extensive user base and business tools 
such as pages and groups made it perfect for connecting with numerous customers. 
Facebook permitted SMEs to share varied content, including images and videos, which 
enhanced brand visibility. Facebook's advertising tools facilitated targeted marketing 
that was economical for small and medium-sized enterprises. It facilitated the creation 
of two-way communication pathways, enhancing customer confidence. The 
adaptability of Facebook has made it an essential platform for the majority of SMEs. 
Facebook formed the foundation of their social media approach. 
In discussions with managers of SMEs, they expressed that WhatsApp was essential 
for direct and personal communication with customers. WhatsApp's messaging feature, 
group conversations, and broadcast capabilities enabled rapid dissemination of 
promotions and product details. Although WhatsApp was not ideal for public branding, 
it proved to be very effective in fostering intimate customer connections. A lot of 

34 
 
customers favored WhatsApp for tailored assistance and quick replies. WhatsApp was 
simple to use and broadly accepted, becoming a favored option. It assisted in 
preserving customer loyalty via continuous engagement. WhatsApp enhanced Facebook 
by providing a more personal communication avenue. The professional profile probably 
enhances the successful utilization of social media for branding in SMEs 
During a focus group discussion with younger social media users, they indicated 
that Instagram was becoming increasingly significant, particularly for SMEs in the 
fashion, hospitality, and food sectors. Instagram's emphasis on visuals through photos 
and videos made it ideal for creatively displaying products. Instagram stories and reels 
engaged younger viewers who appreciated interactive and fun content. Although 
Instagram has potential, restricted internet and smartphone access in rural regions 
limited its complete utilization. Instagram was emerging as the preferred platform for 
SMEs aiming at urban and youthful audiences. It worked well alongside Facebook and 
WhatsApp. The visual attractiveness of Instagram was a significant advantage. 
In discussions with SME managers, they mentioned that Twitter and LinkedIn were 
not as commonly utilized for branding by SMEs. Twitter's local user base was limited, 
and LinkedIn primarily served as a platform for professional connections instead of 
direct advertising. These platforms fulfilled specialized functions, primarily for B2B 
interactions or supplier relationships. The majority of SMEs favored platforms that 
have extensive local user bases, which made Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram more 
suitable. Twitter and LinkedIn proved helpful solely in specific situations. SMEs 
experienced minimal benefits from allocating resources to these platforms. The 
emphasis stayed on platforms that attracted a large number of consumers. 

35 
 
During a focus group discussion with SME staff and followers, they expressed that 
the choice of platform was mainly influenced by customer presence. SMEs selected 
platforms where their intended audience engaged the most to enhance reach and 
interaction. Facebook and WhatsApp were prevalent because of their extensive 
utilization and business features. Instagram was chosen for targeted market segments 
focused on visual material. SMEs refrained from overextending themselves and 
concentrated on their customer locations instead. This approach focused on the 
customer aided in maximizing scarce resources. The selection of the platform was 
intentional and aimed at the audience.

36 
 
local user bases, rendering Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram more viable. Twitter 
and LinkedIn proved to be beneficial solely in specific situations. SMEs experienced 
minimal benefits from allocating resources to these platforms. The emphasis 
continued to be on platforms attractive to a wide consumer base. 
      In a discussion with SME staff and followers in a focus group, they indicated that 
the choice of platform was mainly influenced by customer presence. SMEs selected 
platforms where their intended audience was most engaged to enhance reach and 
interaction. Facebook and WhatsApp thrived because of their extensive popularity and 
business features. Instagram was chosen for particular market segments that are 
focused on visual content. SMEs concentrated on their customer base rather than 
overextending themselves. This approach focused on the customer aided in maximizing 
constrained resources. The selection of the platform was deliberate and centered on 
the audience. 
4.4 Strategies and Practices Employed by SMEs to Enhance Brand Image

In a discussion with SME staff and followers in a focus group, they indicated that 
the choice of platform was mainly influenced by customer presence. SMEs selected 
platforms where their intended audience was most engaged to enhance reach and 
interaction. Facebook and WhatsApp thrived because of their extensive popularity and 
business features. Instagram was chosen for particular market niches with a visual 
content emphasis. SMEs concentrated on their customer base but didn't over-spread 
their efforts. This approach maintained the customer focus and assisted in the 
optimization of scarce resources. The platform selection was deliberate and was built 
around the audience. 
In the interviews of SME managers, they stated that multimedia elements such as 
videos, live streams, and Instagram stories enhanced interactions. Product videos or 
behind-the-scenes were more attention-grabbing than images or text. Live sessions 
enabled real-time customer engagement, creating emotional connections. Multimedia 
made their brands more human. Such interactive content was more memorable and 

38 
 
impactful. Videos enhanced message recall. Multimedia was turning into an even more 
vital tactic. 
In discussions with SME workers and followers, they mentioned that visual branding 
consistency was crucial. Small and medium enterprises employed the same logos, 
colors, and messages on various media. Consistency in branding increased 
professionalism and credibility. Some SMEs employed designers, while others acquired 
graphic knowledge on their own. Visual identity consistency helped brands identify 
more easily. Inconsistency might lead to customers getting confused. Uniformity in 
branding needed constant attention. It formed a significant aspect of marketing. 
When speaking with SME managers, they mentioned that storytelling was a good 
brand-building strategy. SMEs told true stories about their beginnings, values, and 
impact on society. Narrative building created emotional bonds with fans. Brands 
became personal by telling their struggles and successes. Stories established them 
differently from competitors and built allegiance. Narratives gave meaning beyond 
being just products. Many SMEs used storytelling as part of their content. Narratives 
played an essential role for engagement. 
During a focus group with social media followers and SME employees, they 
emphasized that being on trend was important. SMEs monitored hashtags, trending 
challenges, and seasonal topics to keep content updated. Trend relevance boosted 
follower engagement and interest. Trends helped brands look relevant and alive with 
culture. SMEs manage trend uptake with brand consistency. Occasional uptake of trends 
resulted in viral content. Trend tracking was included in ongoing social media activity.

4.5 Challenges Faced by SMEs in Utilizing Social Media for Branding 
During interviews with SME managers, they described how multimedia elements 
like videos, live streams, and Instagram stories added to engagement. Videos featuring 
products or providing backstories were more attention-grabbing than text or images. 
Live sessions enabled real-time customer interaction, establishing emotional 
connections. Multimedia engaged their brands. This interactive content was more 
memorable and effective. Videos helped to recall messages. Multimedia was becoming 
an increasingly strategic approach. 
In conversations with SME employees and their advocates, they highlighted that 
consistency in visual branding mattered. Small and medium businesses all employed 
identical logos, color, and message on multiple platforms. Constant branding made 
them appear more professional and credible. A few SMEs hired designers, while others 
purchased graphic expertise in-house. Having a single visual identity reinforced brand 
recognition. Being consistent may cause confusion for customers. Continuous 
monitoring was required to have consistent branding. It was one of the major aspects 
of marketing. 
In conversations with SME managers, they mentioned that storytelling proved to 
be a powerful strategy for building the brand. SMEs shared authentic stories about their 
beginnings, values, and impact on the community. Storytelling created emotional bonds 
with supporters. Brands became approachable by revealing their struggles and 
successes. Stories distinguished them from competitors and encouraged dedication. 
Narratives offered meaning that went beyond simple items. Many small and medium-
sized companies included storytelling in their content strategies. Stories were 
important for engagement.

When interviewed, SME managers indicated that privacy and security issues 
discouraged them from participating fully in social media.  Fears of losing data, fraud, 
or abuse of brand identities deterred them.  These constraints limited new platform or 
feature exploration.  SMEs wanted clearer advice on how to guard themselves on the 
net. The members felt that there was a requirement for increased understanding of 
data protection. Ambiguity reduced the belief in online marketing campaigns. To 
establish permission, these challenges had to be overcome. Managers and employees of 
SMEs, through interviewation, stated that internal resistance to embracing digital 
marketing was a hurdle. 
More experienced employees or employees with less technology background 
would sometimes find it difficult to use the social media effectively. 
Such friction led to inconsistent branding and low utilization of sites. Changes in 
perceptions and employee training were key to progress. Buy-in from the leadership 
was essential. 
Organizational and cultural issues impacted overall marketing effectiveness. 
Overcoming such organizational and cultural hurdles was crucial.          During focus 
group discussions with SME staff and their followers, they highlighted that cultural 
preferences for in-person engagements and traditional marketing hindered their 
dependence on social media. Certain customers favored face-to-face meetings, leading 
SMEs to find a balance between online and offline interactions. This combined method 
required significant resources, yet it was essential. Combining the two approaches 
facilitated engagement with various audiences. Social media enhanced rather than 

41 
 
substituted traditional marketing. This mirrored the actual conditions of local 
businesses. Adapting to cultural preferences was essential for achievement. 
4.6 Measuring the Effectiveness of Social Media Efforts 
In a focus group discussion with SME staff and social media followers, they had to 
say that follower growth was the most commonly used informal indicator of social 
media success. SMEs tracked increases in likes, followers, and group members as signs 
of growing brand awareness. While follower numbers were helpful, they did not 
guarantee active engagement or sales. Follower quantity was a limited metric. More 
meaningful measurements were needed. Participants expressed interest in tools to 
better assess success. Follower count was only a starting point. 
In interviews with SME managers, they had to say that engagement metrics like 
likes, comments, shares, and direct messages were better indicators of audience 
interest. High interaction levels showed posts resonated with followers and 
encouraged communication. Engagement was a valuable proxy for brand health. 
Meaningful interactions mattered more than passive follower counts. Monitoring 
engagement helped refine content strategies. Engagement was a priority for ongoing 
evaluation. Interaction indicated customer connection. 
In a focus group discussion with SME staff and followers, they had to say that 
customer feedback on social media was an important qualitative measure. Positive 
reviews, testimonials, and recommendations boosted brand reputation. Managing 
negative feedback professionally was critical to maintaining trust. Feedback helped 
SMEs improve products and services. Participants viewed feedback as a vital 
communication and learning tool. Responsiveness to customer opinions strengthened 

42 
 
loyalty. Active feedback channels were essential for brand stewardship. Feedback 
influenced future marketing content. 
In interviews with SME managers, they had to say that practical results such as 
sales inquiries and orders linked to social media platforms were the most concrete 
evidence of branding effectiveness. SMEs often connected specific campaigns or 
promotions to increased sales interest. Formal tracking systems were rare but growing 
in awareness. These tangible outcomes helped justify further investment in social 
media. Sales impact was a key motivator. Linking marketing to business results was 
important. Participants desired better conversion tracking methods. 
In interviews with SME managers, they had to say that most SMEs admitted limited 
use of formal analytics tools like Facebook Insights or Instagram Analytics. This was 
due to lack of time, expertise, and sometimes access. This gap made it hard to analyze 
audience behavior or return on investment. Without data, optimizing social media 
efforts was challenging. Participants wanted more training to improve analytics skills. 
Data literacy was essential for future success. Better analytics would enhance decision-
making. 
In interviews with SME managers and employees, they had to say that some SMEs 
developed basic internal monitoring methods such as manually tracking daily 
engagement or noting inquiries linked to social media activity. These simple practices 
provided helpful, though limited, insights. Informal tracking was better than no 
measurement. Such methods helped identify effective content types. Participants 
believed more robust systems could improve evaluation. Data collection was an 
evolving practice. There was willingness to adopt better tools.

In focus group discussions with SME staff and social media followers, they had to 
say that there was a strong desire for training on social media analytics and data 
interpretation. SMEs wanted to make data-driven decisions to improve content, 
timing, and platform use. Enhanced skills would boost marketing outcomes and justify 
resource allocation. Capacity building was critical for sustained success. Participants 
expressed eagerness for practical, user-friendly training. Data empowerment would 
increase confidence. Analytics was the future of digital marketing. 
In summary, in focus group discussions and interviews with SME staff and 
managers, they had to say that while follower growth and engagement gave useful 
feedback, lack of systematic, quantitative measurement limited SMEs’ ability to fully 
leverage social media for brand building. Addressing these gaps through training and 
access to tools could significantly improve results. Measurement was vital for 
sustainable digital marketing success. Data was key to unlocking potential. Investments 
in analytics capacity would pay off. Measurement was a cornerstone of future 
strategies.
