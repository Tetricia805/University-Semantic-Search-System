Introduction
Most real mathematical problems do not have analytical solutions. However, they do have
real solutions. In order to obtain these solutions we must use other methods such as graphical
representations, or numerical analysis. Numerical analysis is the mathematical method that
uses numerical approximations to obtain numerical answers to the problem. Numerical analysis
also considers the accuracy of an approximation, and when the approximation is good enough.
Numerical answers are useful because we use numbers to build our world, not with the exact
analytical solution, such as
eπ
√

The ever-increasing advances in computer technology has enabled many in science and engi-
neering to apply numerical methods to simulate physical phenomena. Numerical methods are
often divided into elementary ones such as finding the root of an equation, integrating a func-
tion or solving a linear system of equations to intensive ones like the finite element method.
Intensive methods are often needed for the solution of practical problems and they often re-
quire the systematic application of a range of elementary methods, often thousands or millions
of times over. In the development of numerical methods, simplifications need to be made to
progress towards a solution: for example general functions may need to be approximated by
polynomials and computers cannot generally represent numbers exactly anyway. As a result,
numerical methods do not usually give the exact answer to a given problem, or they can only
tend towards a solution getting closer and closer with each iteration. Numerical methods are
generally only useful when they are implemented on computer using a computer program-
ming language .
The study of the behavior of numerical methods is called numerical analysis. This is a mathe-
matical subject that considers the modeling of the error in the processing of numerical methods
and the subsequent re-design of methods.
Numerical analysis involves the study of methods of computing numerical data. In many prob-
lems this implies producing a sequence of approximations; thus the questions involve the rate
of convergence, the accuracy (or even validity) of the answer, and the completeness of the re-
sponse. (With many problems it is difficult to decide from a program’s termination whether
other solutions exist.) Since many problems across mathematics can be reduced to linear alge-
bra, this too is studied numerically; here there are significant problems with the amount of time
necessary to process the initial data. Numerical solutions to differential equations require the
determination not of a few numbers but of an entire function; in particular, convergence must
be judged by some global criterion. Other topics include numerical simulation, optimization,
and graphical analysis, and the development of robust working code.
Numerical linear algebra topics: Solutions of linear systems AX = B, eigenvalues and eigenvec-
1

tors, matrix factorizations. Calculus topics: numerical differentiation and integration, interpo-
lation, solutions of nonlinear equations f(x) = 0. Statistical topics: polynomial approximation,
curve fitting.
Further information on the elementary methods can be found in books on numerical methods
or books on numerical analysis. Dedicated text books can be found on each of the intensive
methods. Details of available books can be accessed through www.science-books.net .

Numerical
methods are often divided into elementary ones such as finding the root of an equation,
integrating a function or solving a linear system of equations to intensive ones like the
finite element method. Intensive methods are often needed for the solution of practical
problems and they often require the systematic application of a range of elementary
methods, often thousands or millions of times over. In the development of numerical
methods, simplifications need to be made to progress towards a solution: for example
general functions may need to be approximated by polynomials and computers cannot
generally represent numbers exactly anyway.
As a result, numerical methods do not
usually give the exact answer to a given problem, or they can only tend towards a solution
getting closer and closer with each iteration. Numerical methods are generally only useful
when they are implemented on computer using a computer programming language .

2. Numerical Methods refers to procedures to find approximate solutions when exact solu-
tions cannot be found in a straightforward manner.
3. Linear interpolation assumes that if two points on a graph are given, any point in between
them can be found by connecting the original two points by a straight line.
Newton Raphson is a method to find approximate solutions to an equation through an
iterative process where each calculated value is used as the starting point for the next
calculated value. NRM requires that you can evaluate the first derivative of that equation.

1.1. WHAT IS NUMERICAL ANALYSIS?
1.1
What is Numerical Analysis?
- It is a way to do highly complicated mathematics problems on a computer.
- it is also known as a technique widely used by scientists and engineers to solve their
problems.
1.2
Two issues of Numerical Analysis:
- How to compute? This corresponds to algorithmic aspects;
- How accurate is it? That corresponds to error analysis aspects.
1.3
Advantages and Disadvantages of Numerical Analy-
sis:
Although numerical solutions are just an approximation, an estimate of an exact solution
(numerical values are ”near” solutions or often referred to as inexact solutions) due to
1.) truncation errors,
2.) round off errors,
3.) chop off errors,
Other than the truncation errors involved in numerical methods, numerical algorithms are
computationally involved, calling for powerful computing abilities and machines. The schemes
are usually multi steps and multi terms.
However, numerical techniques are widely applied in solving real world problem.
1.3.1
Hard or impossible classical solutions
It can obtain numerical answers of the problems that have very hard analytical techniques or
sometimes impossible to solve (no ”exact or classical” solution).
Example 1.3.1
Finding the classical solution to an integral

ex2 dx
is quite very hard if not impossible.
Example 1.3.2
Solving a simple looking first order ordinary differential equation
dy
dx = x2 + y2
analytically is not easy at all.
ssebuliba & ddumba

1.4. IMPORTANT NOTES:
1.3.2
Tabulated data
Usually we only have tabulated data when faced with complex real world models, and do not
have an explicitly defined function.
Example 1.3.3
To compute the area under the curve defined by the table below
x
1
3
5
7
f(x)
-3
5
21
45
will be analytically impossible since we do not know the explicit definition of f(x) that was
used to generate the table above. To compute
 7
1
f(x)dx
will not be possible.
The table above was actually generated by f(x) = x2 −4 which we did not know prior, and
too hard to interpolate.
1.4
Important Notes:
1.) Numerical analysis solution is always numerical.
2.) Results from numerical analysis is an approximation.
1.5
Numerical Errors
When we get into the real world from an ideal world and finite to infinite, errors arise.
1.5.1
Sources of Errors:
1.) Mathematical problems involving quantities of infinite precision.
2.) Numerical methods bridge the precision gap by putting errors under firm control.
3.) Computer can only handle quantities of finite precision.
1.5.2
Types of Errors:
1.5.2.1
Truncation error
Truncation error is a consequence of doing only a finite number of steps in a calculation that
would require an infinite number of steps to do exactly. A simple example of a calculation
that will be affected by truncation error is the evaluation of an infinite sum using the NSum
function. The computer certainly isn’t going to compute values for all of the terms in an infinite
sum. The terms that are left out lead to truncation error.
Truncation Error: The essence of any numerical method is that it is approximate-this usually
occurs because of truncation, e.g., cos x ∼= 1 −x2
2 or terminating an infinite sequence of opera-
tions after a finite number have been performed.
It is not possible by numerical techniques alone to get an accurate estimate of the size of the

numerical analysis i

1.5. NUMERICAL ERRORS
truncation error in a result. It is possible for any purely numerical algorithm, including the
algorithms used by numerical functions in Mathematica, to produce incorrect results, and to
do so without warning. The only way to be certain that results from functions like NIntegrate
and NDSolve are correct is to do some independent analysis, possibly including detailed in-
vestigation of the algorithm that was used to do the calculation. Such investigations are an
important part of the field of numerical analysis.
For example, after using Taylor expansion
ex = 1 + x
1! + x2
2! + x3
3! + · · ·
cos x = 1 −x2
2! + x4
4! −x6
6! + x8
8! −· · ·
sin x = x −x3
3! + x5
5! −x7
7! + x9
9! + · · ·
You could realize that there are many terms you have truncated off in the expansion, thats
why · · ·
1.5.2.2
Round off errors
Numbers can be stored only up to a fixed finite number of digits: Additional digits may be
rounded or chopped. Rounding error is sometimes characterized by ξmachine, the largest (posi-
tive) number that the machine (computer) cannot distinguish between 1 and 1+ ξmachine.
Roundoff error, or representation error, is the error associated with the fact that the computer
keeps only a finite number of digits in calculations with inexact numbers. Since it is not pos-
sible (except in special cases) to represent all of the digits in numbers like 1/3 or π or
√
2,
computers store only the first few digits in numerical approximations of these numbers. In
typical situations, the computer will store only the first 16 decimal digits or the first 53 binary
digits. The remaining digits are discarded. The discarded digits lead to errors in the result.
One of the more conspicuous symptoms of roundoff error is the appearance of tiny non-zero
numbers in results that would otherwise be zero.
Although the ability to reduce the effects of roundoff error by raising the precision of a calcu-
lation is certainly very useful, it is far from a universal solution to all problems with numerical
error.
1.) 1.8625 to three decimal places, it becomes 1.863
2.) 1.8625 to two decimal places, it becomes 1.86
3.) 1.8625 to one decimal place, it become 1.9

Chapter 2
Numerical Techniques of Integration
There are two main reasons for you to need to do numerical integration: analytical integration
may be impossible or infeasible, or you may wish to integrate tabulated data rather than known
functions. In this section we outline the main approaches to numerical integration. Which is
preferable depends in part on the results required, and in part on the function or data to be
integrated.
This will be useful when we cannot find an elementary antiderivative for f(x) or if the function
is defined using data obtained from some experiment.
Numerical integration is the numerical approximation of the integral of a function.
For a
function of one variable, it amounts to finding the area under the graph of the function. That
is finding I where
I =
 b
a
f(x) dx
Methods generally replace the integral by a weighted sum of n weights and n function evalua-
tions, so that
I =
n
X
i=1
Wif(xi) dx
For a function of two variables it is equivalent to finding an approximation to the volume under
the surface. Numerical integration is often also referred to as quadrature or sometimes cubature
for functions of two or more variables. Returning to the one variable case, numerical integration
involves finding the approximation to an integral of a function f(x) through its evaluation at
a set of discrete points. There are two distinct approaches to this. Firstly methods like the
trapezium rule or Simpson’s rule determine the integral through evaluating f(x) at regularly
spaced points. These are generally referred to as Newton-Cotes formulae.
Alternative methods termed Gaussian Quadrature methods have arisen that select irregularly-
placed evaluation points, chosen to determine the integral as accurately as possible with a given
set of points.
Gaussian Quadrature methods are important as they often lead to very efficient methods. In
numerical integration the efficiency of the method relates to the accuracy obtained with respect
to the number of evaluations of the function f(x). In intensive methods such as the boundary
element method integrations may need to be performed millions of times so the efficiency of
the methods needs to be considered sometimes.

2.1. MANUAL METHOD
2.1
Manual Method
If you were to perform the integration by hand, one approach is to superimpose a grid on
a graph of the function to be integrated, and simply count the squares, counting only those
covered by 50% or more of the function. Provided the grid is sufficiently fine, a reasonably
accurate estimate may be obtained.
2.2
Trapezoidal/Trapezium rule
2.2.1
Composite Trapezoidal Rule
To derive the rule, we use the following figure
We divide [a, b] into n equal subintervals, each a Trapezium with width h = (b −a)

f(x)dx + . . . +
 xi+1
xi
f(x)dx + . . . +
 xn
xn−1
f(x)dx.
Applying the trapezium equation, we get compute the total areas of all the n trapeziums
I = h
2 [f(x0) + f(x1)] + h
2 [f(x1) + f(x2)] + · · · + h
2 [f(xn−2) + f(xn−1)] + h
2 [f(xn−1) + f(xn)]

f(x) =

2.3. SIMPSON’S RULE
2.3
Simpson’s Rule
Note 2.3.1 We can obtain the Simpson’s rule by various ways. One of the most popular ways
is from Lagrange’s quadratic interpolation polynomial. The Simpson’s rule approximates the
area under the curve y = f(x) from x0 to x2 by the area under a parabolic curve.
Interpolating f(x) by a Lagrange polynomial of degree 2 i.e. P2(x) then
f(x) = P2(x) + Etrunc(x)
So
 x2
x0
f(x)dx =
 x2
x0
P2(x)dx +
 x2
x0
Etrunc(x)dx
(2.4)
Results
Summing up all the three cases, equation (2.4) becomes
 x2
x0
P2(x)dx = h
3[f0 + 4f1 + f2] + Etrunc(x)
Thus
 x2
x0
P2(x)dx = h
3[f0 + 4f1 + f2]
(2.5)
Relation equation (2.5) is the Simpson’s rule for approximating the integral. The integral
for the error in equation (2.4), becomes
 x2
x0
Etrunc(x)dx =
 x2
x0
(x −x0)(x −x1)(x −x2)
3!
f (4)(c(x))dx
This can be shown (with difficulty!, for n = 2) to be
−Mh5

That the fourth derivative f 4 is continuous on [a, b] and that |f 4(x)| < M for all x in [a, b].
Example 2.3.1
Use Simpson’s rule (n = 2) to approximate the integral I =
 1
0
x2dx.
Solution Since
I =
 1
0
f(x)dx ≃h
3[f(x0) + 4f(x1) + f(x2)]
But
x0 = 0,
x1 = 1

x2 = 1,
h = (1 −0)

Therefore

rule has generated the exact value of the integral. In fact the general result is that for f(x) a
polynomial of degree two or less, the Simpson” rule will always generate the exact value of the
integral. This will later be stated as a theorem.

Simpson’s Rule Truncation Error
The truncation error in Simpson’s rule is given by
Etrunc = −h5
90[f (4)(c1) + f (4)(c2) + . . . + f (4)(cn)] = −h5
90f (4)(c2) × n = −(b −a)h4

where a ≤ξ ≤b. Therefore
Etrunc = (b −a)h4

Since [0,1] is divided into two subintervals S2, each subinterval has

Since f (4)(x) = 0 and consequently we see that

180
(0) = 0
This bound indicates that the value obtained through Simpson’s rule is exact. A

Since the error term is −(b −a)

f ′(x) = 2xex2
f ′′(x) = 2(ex2 + 2xex2) = 2ex2(1 + 2x2) = ex2(2 + 4x2)
f ′′′(x) = 2xex2(2 + 4x2) + 8xex2

Solution :
Note that here the points are not given to be equidistant, so as
such we can not use any of the above two formulae. However, we notice that the
tabular points 0.05, 0.10, 0, 15 and 0.20 are equidistant and so are the tabular points
0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9 and 1.0 . Now we can divide the interval in two
subinterval: [0.05, 0.2] and [0.2, 1.0] ; thus,
1

0.05
f(x)dx =
0.2

0.05
f(x)dx +
1

0.2
f(x)dx.
The integrals then can be evaluated in each interval. We observe that the second set
has odd number of points (even subintervals). Thus, the first integral is evaluated by
using Trapezoidal rule and the second one by Simpson’s rule (of course, one could
have used Trapezoidal rule in both the subintervals).
For the first integral h = 0.05 and for the second one h = 0.1. Thus, first part by
Trapezoidal scheme,
0.2

0.05
f(x)dx = 0.05
2
× [0.0785 + 0.3090 + 2 (0.1564 + 0.2334)] = 0.0291775,
and, second part by Simpson’s rule,
1.0

0.2
f(x)dx = 0.1
3 × [(0.3090 + 1.0000) + 2 × (0.5878 + 0.8090 + 0.9511)
+4 × (0.4540 + 0.7071 + 0.8910 + 0.9877)]
= 0.6054667,
which gives,
1

0.05
f(x)dx = 0.0291775 + 0.6054667 = 0.6346442
It may be mentioned here that in the above integral, f(x) = sin
π
2 x

and that the
value of the integral is 0.6346526 . It will be interesting for the reader to compute
the two integrals using Trapezoidal rule and compare the values.

Example 2.5.2
What value of n should be used to guarantee that an estimate of
 1
0
ex2 dx
is accurate to within 0.01 if we use the midpoint rule?
Solution :
We begin by determining the value of M, the maximum value of
|f ′′(x)| over [0, 1] for f(x) = ex2. Since f ′(x) = 2xex2, we have
f ′′(x) = 2ex2 + 4x2ex2.
Thus,
|f ′′(x)| = 2ex2(1 + 2x2) ≤2 · e · 3 = 6e.
From the error-bound Equation, we have the error in Mn
EM ≤M(b −a)3
24n2
≤6e(1 −0)3
24n2
=
6e
24n2.
Now we solve the following inequality for n (accurate to within 0.01):
6e
24n2 ≤0.01
Thus,
n ≥
r
600e
24
≈8.24.
Since n must be an integer satisfying this inequality, a choice of n = 9 would guar-

f ′′(x) = 2, so M = 2 such that

4.) So the absolute error in the approximation generated by eight steps of the mid-

5.) The relative error is then
|approximate −exact|

That is the error is 0.0004 times the actual value of the integral.
6.) We can write this as a percentage error by multiplying it by 100
percentage error = 100 × |approximate −exact|

= 0.04%
That is, the error is about 0.04% of the exact value.

x0 = 0
x1 = π

■
Remark 2.5.2 These last two examples suggest that the Simpson’s rule is more accurate than
the midpoint rule and the trapezoidal rule. Indeed, this observation is born out by a rigorous
analysis of the error.
Note 2.5.1 Two obvious considerations when deciding whether or not a given algorithm is of
any practical value are
1.) the amount of computational effort required to execute the algorithm
2.) the accuracy that this computational effort yields.
To get a first impression of the error behaviour of these methods, we apply them to a problem
whose answer we know exactly:
 π
0
sin x dx = −cos x
π
0 = 2.
To be a little more precise, we would like to understand how the errors of the three methods
change as we increase the effort we put in (as measured by the number of steps n).
The
following table lists the error in the approximate value for this number generated by our three
rules applied with three different choices of n. It also lists the number of evaluations of f
required to compute the approximation.

1000 evaluations of f worth of the midpoint rule.
2.) The trapezoidal rule error with n steps is about twice the midpoint rule error with n steps.
3.) With the midpoint rule, increasing the number of steps by a factor of 10 appears to reduce
the error by about a factor of 100 = 102 = n2.
4.) With the trapezoidal rule, increasing the number of steps by a factor of 10 appears to reduce
the error by about a factor of 102 = n2.

How many steps n required for approximating
 1
0
e−x2 dx
using the midpoint rule to within an accuracy of 10−6.
Solution :
1.) The integral has a = 0 and b = 1.
2.) The first two derivatives of the integrand are
d
dxe−x2 = −2xe−x2
and
d2
dx2e−x2 = d
dx
 −2xe−x2
= −2e−x2 + 4x2e−x2 = 2(2x2 −1)e−x2
3.) As x runs from 0 to 1, 2x2 −1 increases from −1 to 1, so that
0 ≤x ≤1 =⇒|2x2 −1| ≤1, e−x2 ≤1 =⇒
2(2x2 −1)e−x2 ≤2
So we take M = 2.
4.) The error introduced by the n step midpoint rule is at most

24
(b −a)3
n2
≤2
24
(1 −0)3
n2
=

12n2
5.) We need this error to be smaller than 10−6 so
EM ≤
1
12n2 ≤10−6
and so
12n2 ≥106
clean up
n2 ≥106
12 = 83333.3
square root both sides
n ≥288.7
So 289 steps of the midpoint rule will do the job.
6.) In fact n = 289 results in an error of about 3.7 × 10−7.
That seems like far too much work, and the trapezoidal rule will have twice the error.

0 ≤x2, x4 ≤1
so

ES ≤

5n4 ≤10−6
and so
5n4 ≥106
n4 ≥200000
take fourth root
n ≥21.15
So 22 steps of Simpson’s rule will do the job.

2.5. COMPARISON OF THE NUMERICAL INTEGRATION TECHNIQUES
6.) Just n = 22 steps (as compared to midpoint n = 289 steps results in an error
of about 3.7 × 10−7 ) results in an error of about 3.5 × 10−8.
That seems like far too less work, as compared to work required by Midpoint and the
Trapezoidal rule.

Remark 2.6.1
• The Trapezoid Rule is nothing more than the average of the left-hand and right-hand
Riemann Sums. It provides a more accurate approximation of total change than either
sum does alone.
• Simpson’s Rule is a weighted average that results in an even more accurate approximation.
• The Mid-point rule is the Riemann sums at mid points (Not the average of the two
Riemann sums, that would be Trapezoidal)
Example 2.6.4 Determine the smallest number of subintervals required to guarantee accuracy
to within 0.002 in the approximation of
 1

ex2dx using Trapezoidal rule.
Solution :
Using the Truncation error of Trapezoidal, (2.2) on page (p. 7). Since
f(x) = ex2 ⇒f ′′(x) = 4x2ex2 + 2ex2 on [0, 1] ⇒M = 6e. Therefore,
|Etrunc| ≤M(b −a)3
12n2
= 6e(1 −0)

= 0.002 ⇒n = 36.86 = 37
