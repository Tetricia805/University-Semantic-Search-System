Abstract: A study was conducted to determine the species richness and nutritive values of fodder and their relationship with 
soil characteristics in the Ugandan rangelands. The aim of the study was to determine the current status and nutritive values of 
fodder species and their relationship with soil characteristics. Four fodder species Panicum maximum - Guinea grass, 
Spartinaalterniflora - Cord grass, Hyperreniarufa -Jaragua/thatching grass and Acacia spp were selected for the study. The 
species were counted to determine their richness in their rangelands and also tested to establish their nutritive values. The focus 
on nutritive values was on CP, NDF, Ca, P and K. The research also determined the soil characteristics pH, OM, N, P and K. 
Results of the study show that the fodder species were below the recommended levels of species richness in the rangelands. 
Spartinaalterniflora (Cord grass) had the largest coverage of 109.1Km2 (22.4%) out of 486Km2 in the rangelands while Acacia 
had the lowest coverage of 10.2 Km2 (2.1%). All the soil characteristics were below the minimum concertration levels apart 
from P and there was a significant difference in soil characteristics across the different locations (P<0.05). Average pH was 
6.63, OM was 0.5%, and P was 74.09ppm while K was 17cmoles/kg. The most nutritious fodder species was Panicum 
maximum (Guinea grass). However all the fodder species were below the recommended nutrient levels. The mean 
concentration level of CP in all the fodder species was8.95%, Ca was 1.29%, P was 0.4%, K was 1.59% while NDF was 29%. 
There was no significant difference in level of concentration across all the fodder species (P>0.05). Reduction of overstocking; 
growing of Panicum maximum (Guinea grass) at farm level; and rotation of animals are recommended.

1. Introduction 
Fodder species richness and their nutritive values has been 
a concern for most researchers focusing rangeland studies [1]. 
Their relationship with soil status has equally been a great 
concern due to the role played by soil through its soil 
characteristics [2]. The term rangeland globally refers to area 
with arid or semi-arid and dry sub-humid climates, and where 
topography and soils are unsuitable for food crop farming [3]. 
In the sub-Saharan region, rangelands have very limited 
opportunities for crop cultivation but are very suitable for 
livestock production. Most of these areas are dominated by 
arid and semi-arid landscapes [4]. Most rangeland dwellers 
prioritize cattle production over crop growing due to frequent 
droughts and low/fluctuating rainfall patterns. 
In Uganda, as is the case in the rest of sub-Saharan Africa, 
naturally growing fodder still serve largely as a source of 
essential nutrients for livestock grazing. Species richness has 
potential to boost livestock productivity in rangelands. This is 
because the higher the richness the more balanced the nutritional 
values are for animal consumption in the rangelands [4]. In 

39 
Christine Kyoshabire et al.:  Species Richness and Nutritive Values of Fodder and Their Relationship  
 
with Soil Characteristics in Ugandan Rangelands 
Uganda, species richness in the rangelands is not well studied, 
however the scanty information available shows that the fodder 
species in the rangelands are mainly Panicum maximum (Guinea 
grass), Spartinaalterniflora (Cord grass), Hyperreniarufa 
(Jaragua/thatching grass), and Acacia spp. [5-7]There are other 
species available in the rangelands but these are the dominant 
ones that support livestock grazing in the rangelands of Uganda. 
The richness of fodder species and their nutritional values are 
among other factors influenced by physical and chemical 
properties of the soil in the rangelands. Soil types play a very big 
role in ensuring nutritional efficiency as well as richness in the 
rangelands [8]. Favourable soil characterises such as high 
organic matter and good pH are associated with high fodder 
regeneration rate in the rangelands. Similarly nutritional content 
in the fodder species is influenced by the soil characteristics 
such as nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium content in the soil. 
For example crude protein which is a critical ingredient in 
fodder species for livestock consumption is influenced by 
nitrogen content in the soil [3]. Concentrations of mineral 
elements in forage are dependent upon the interaction of a 
number of factors, including soil, plant species, stage of maturity, 
yield, pasture management and climate [9]. Even though it is a 
known fact that these factors influence nutritional efficiency of 
fodder species, little is known about the levels and extent of this 
in the rangelands of Uganda. 
The rangeland conditions and status of fodder species has 
been largely attributed to unsustainable practices especially 
overgrazing, bush burning and deforestation that is largely 
influenced by charcoal trade [10]. Such practices lead to soil 
erosion and can hinder the net primary production of the 
grass layer yet soil nutrients and their accessibility are 
important factors controlling net primary productivity of 
rangeland’s natural vegetation [7]. 
There has been little research done in rangeland areas of 
Uganda to determine species richness and nutritive values of 
fodder and their relationship with soil characteristics. Little 
information is available on the mineral status of the fodder 
species in rangelands of Uganda. It is not clear whether the 
fodder species available in rangelands for animals to graze on 
are still able to deliver the much needed nutrients to the 
animals; yet this information would be vital in planning the 
necessary improvements that would go a long way in 
improving the livelihoods of the people who depend on the 
rangelands for survival. This study thus investigated the 
current species richness, the soil characteristics and nutritive 
values of the fodder species (Panicum maximum (Guinea 
grass), Spartinaalterniflora (Cord grass), Hyperreniarufa 
(Jaragua/thatching grass), and Acacia spp.) in order to 
provide the right diagnosis to the problem identified above. 
2. Materials and Methods 
2.1. Description of the Study Area 
The study was carried out in the rangelands of Kayunga 
District 74 Km East of Kampala City in Uganda. Its 
coordinates 
are 
1°20'41.0"N, 
32°23'24.0"E 
(Latitude: 
1.2041N; Longitude: 32.8490). The altitude ranges between 
1000-1200m above sea level. Kayonza sub-county occupies a 
land area of approximately 486 Km2. Rural communities 
around the rangelands are mainly comprised of the Baganda, 
Basoga, Banyankole, Bagweri, Bakiga, Banyarwanda and 
immigrant Bahima among other ethnics. The precipitation, 
temperature, soil and vegetation in most of these areas 
support pastoralism activities which explain why agro-
pastoralism is a popular practice in the rangelands of Uganda. 
2.2. Study Design 
Belt transects of up to 1 km between the 25mx25m 
demarcations to the north, south, east and west from the 
center of the selected parishes were established and divided 
into experimental plots (Kapu, 2012). At least 5 plots were 
established along each of the 4 directions making it a total of 
20 plots per parish. The plots were 200 meters apart along the 
transects. A total of 40 plots were established for counting. 
There were however two plots at the centre where each of the 
two belt transects meet which were added to the 40 plots that 
were established in the two parishes making them 42 plots. 
The midpoints (centres) for the selected parishes were 
established through group discussions in which the local 
residents together with their leaders were engaged to draw 
resource maps. The actual counting was done by identifying 
the patches covered by each of the fodder species within the 
25mx25m plots since grass cannot be counted individually. 
The width and lengths of the patches was then measured 
using a tape measure and recorded in the book. Plots were 
sketched and the patches located in each of the plots. 
 
Figure 1. Distribution of the plots within the study area. 
For soil sampling, two plots were randomly sampled along 
the west-east transects and the south-north transects for 
extracting soil samples. The sampling plot at the midpoint 

 
American Journal of Agriculture and Forestry 2018; 6(3): 38-43 
40 
 
where the transects met/converged also acted as a sampling 
point [3]. In total 5 plots were randomly selected from each 
parish making it 10 plots from which soil was sampled. Soil 
samples were picked using an auger. Soil was picked from all 
the corners of the selected plots and mixed together before 
being packed in the polythene bags to achieve uniform 
distribution of soil. The soil was air dried under shade and 
the weather was sunny and windy. From each plot, at least ½ 
a kilogram of soil was picked. Samples were marked and 
given labels according to the point of sampling before being 
transported to the laboratory for analysis to ease traceability 
problems. Soil was extracted between 0-20cm deep from the 
surface using the soil auger. This was because the fodders 
sampled were shallow rooted. 
Five tests were carried out on each sample making a total 
of 50 tests on the 10 soil samples collected. The tests covered 
pH, Organic Mater Content (OM), Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus 
(P) and Potassium (K). Sample analysis was carried out 
following the procedures of Okalebo and Kapu [3, 11]. 
2.3. Sampling of the Selected Fodder Species 
Five (5) plots were randomly selected from the 10 plots 
from where the soil was sampled. From each plot 4 fodder 
species 
(Panicum 
maximum 
- 
Guinea 
grass, 
Spartinaalterniflora 
- 
Cord 
grass, 
Hyperreniarufa 
-
Jaragua/thatching grass and Acacia spp) were sampled. 
Cutting was done at least 10 cm above the ground except for 
acacia which was harvested from the branches because the 
height of the acacia ranged between 0.5m-2.5m. The grass 
was harvested with stems. The stems were targeted because 
of their richness in crude protein. Crude protein was among 
the parameters that were analyzed during the study. At least 
half a kilo of each fodder species was harvested. Twenty (20) 
samples were picked for analysis in the laboratory. Selected 
fodder species were put in clean paper bags. Samples were 
properly labelled to ease traceability in the laboratory. 
Samples were transported to the laboratory immediately to 
minimize changes in the physical and chemical integrity of 
the samples. Upon arrival at the laboratory, samples were 
checked for any damages, spoilage and deterioration before 
being accepted in the laboratory for analysis. All the 
procedures were guided by Kapu [3]. A total of 100 tests 
were carried out on the 20 samples. From each of the five 
plots, samples of the four species selected for the study were 
picked. This means that each species was sampled from each 
of the five plots. Each species was subjected to 5 tests. The 
tests were CP, NDF, Ca, P and K. Sample preparation and 
analysis was carried out following the procedures of 
VanSoest [18, 19] 
2.4. Data Analysis 
Fodder species richness measured in each plot was 
calculated in meters and then converted to kilometres. Data 
from the laboratory about soil characteristics and nutrient 
content of fodder species was sorted in accordance with the 
codes assigned to the samples. Data was further segregated 
by species type and location. Analysis of variance and 
regression analysis were used to determine the significance 
of relationships between the samples and across the different 
locations. The correlation between soil characteristics and 
species richness was determined using a regression analysis 
in which R2 was determined. 
3. Results and Discussion 
3.1. Coverage of Fodder Species 
The study showed that fodder species richness is generally 
low in the rangeland. Spartinaalterniflora (Cord grass)had 
the largest coverage of 109.1km2(22.4%) out of 486Km2 
which Kayonza rangeland covers. Panicum maximum 
(Guinea grass) had the second largest coverage of 70.68km2 
(14.5%) while Hyperreniarufa (Jaragua/thatching grass) 
covered 56.03km2 (11.5%) of the three grass species studied. 
As for acacia, the coverage was 10.2 Km2 (2.1%) and was the 
lowest (Figure 2). Species richness must be at least 200m2 
and above in a plot of 25mx25m in a savannah rangeland [3]. 
However, from the analysis of results, it was found out that 
the average richness of species in the plots that were 
randomly established during field data collection was 
102.73m2 per plot of 25mx25m. This is below the 
recommended average. The low species richness points 
towards over grazing and conversion of some parts of the 
rangeland to crop lands. There was evidence of crop growing 
activity in some farmlands. Some areas were first cultivated 
and later abandoned to regenerate and form pasture. This 
kind of pasture differed from the one that was observed in 
areas where crop farming had not been carried out. Most of 
the acacia was harvested for fuel as it gives good charcoal 
and firewood and attracts customers and this explains the low 
richness of the specie in the area. Analysis of variance 
(ANOVA) showed that there was a significant difference 
between coverage of the fodder species studied (P<0.05). 
 
Figure 2. Coverage of fodder species in the rangeland. 
Species richness also correlated with soil characteristics. 
Kapureported that soil conditions significantly influence the 
richness of grass in rangelands [3]. This is the case in 
Kayonzarangelands because the areas that had high level of 

41 
Christine Kyoshabire et al.:  Species Richness and Nutritive Values of Fodder and Their Relationship  
 
with Soil Characteristics in Ugandan Rangelands 
species richness were also found to be more fertile. 
Overgrazing could also contribute to species reduction. 
During the study it was observed that areas which were not 
overgrazed had high species richness. This is a clear 
indication that overgrazing could negatively affect species 
richness. Related observations were made by Smet and Ward 
[12]. These report that plant species composition, diversity 
and vegetation structure in a semi-arid savannah is affected 
by the size of the herd per square kilometre in the rangeland. 
3.2. Physical and Chemical Properties of the Soil 
Soil was generally not suitable for growing fodder as 
evidenced from the results of status of pH, Organic Matter 
(OM), Nitrogen (N) and Potassium (K). Eighty percent (80%) 
of the soil samples tested for OM content were below the 
recommended levels of >3%. Concerning pH, only 40% of 
the samples were within the recommended levels of 5.5-6.5. 
As for N, only one sample met the recommended level of 
0.2%. The rest of the samples (90%) were below the 
recommended levels. Concerning K, none of the samples met 
the recommended level of concertration which is >3moles/kg. 
However, all the soil samples met recommended levels of 
available P. The average concentration of pH, OM, N, P and 
K was 6.63, 2.39%, 0.15%, 74.09ppm and 2.17moles/kg 
respectively (Table 1). Soil whose average concentration of 
OM is above 3% with Nitrogen concentration that is above 
0.2% is regarded to be suitable for animal fodder (3 and 15). 
This is because such soil will favour the quick growth and 
multiplication of the grass. Related results were obtained by 
Solomon, [13] during assessment of rangeland dynamics in 
southern Ethiopia in which focus was put on the botanical 
composition of grasses and soil characteristics in relation to 
land-use and distance from water. The study found out that 
the rangeland soils were fertile but lacked adequate moisture 
to facilitate the effectiveness of the chemical properties in the 
soil. 
The physical and chemical properties of the soil varied 
greatly with different locations (P<0.05). This correlates with 
the fodder species richness where areas that had better soil 
properties also had high species richness. These variations 
could be attributed to overgrazing, over cultivation, 
variations in defoliation levels of vegetation cover in the 
rangeland and differences in moisture levels [3].

The pH showed no significant difference between the 
different locations in the rangelands (P>0.05). The pH level 
is an important soil factor measured as level of acidity (>6.5) 
or alkalinity (<5.5). Incompliant soil pH can be a major 
contributing factor to fodder stand failure. The level of pH 
above 6.5 hinders available Phosphorus (P) in soil for pasture 
uptake [3] and this was also true in the rangelands of 
Kayunga based on the regression analysis between pH and 
available P (R2=0.8167). 
OM showed significant variations between different 
locations of the rangelands (P<0.05). OM was generally 
available across the rangelands probably due to the dense 
level of woody plants and grass defoliation [13] which 
accumulated a large portion of dead plants/grass material 
under a moist condition for rapid decaying and then these 
materials are converted into soil essential minerals [14]. 
There were significant variations between different locations 
of the rangelands as pertains to Nitrogen (P<0.05). The 
means of Nitrogen and Potassium at different locations were 
significantly different at an alpha of 0.05. N and P are 
essential nutrients for plant growth due to the large amounts 
absorbed from the root zone in the production of pastures [1]. 
At times N and P are unavailable because they are held 
between layers of clay mineral which is referred to as fixed 
Potassium [3]. The soils in the pasture lands studied lacked 
adequate amounts of K as evidenced by the results (Table 1). 
The concentration of K did not significantly differ in the 
different locations of the rangelands (P>0.05). However, in 
some pasture lands K is supplied in a recommended amount 
for nutrition of plants [1]. The variations in physical and 
chemical properties of the soil across different locations have 
also been reported by Maharjan [1] and past anthropogenic 
damage such as over cultivation, overgrazing, deforestation 
and bush burning (a common practice among the pastoralists) 
influence the variations. 
The soil properties discussed above influenced species

richness in the study area. This means that if the soil 
properties are favourable, there is a high potential for fodder 
to grow significantly [15]. However, if the soil properties are 
unfavourable, there is a likelihood of fodder species richness 
being low [13]. 
3.3. Nutrient Composition of Fodder Species 
The analysis of results shows that majority of the 
nutritional values in the fodder species did not meet the 
recommended concentrations.

(2.04±0.24%) 
was 
Spartinaalterniflora (Cord grass). Acacia spp had the least 
concentration level of 0.98±0.24%. Panicum maximum 
(Guinea grass) had the highest percentage of NDF 
(36.54±1.34%). This was followed by Spartinaalterniflora 
(Cord grass) with NDF of 30.2±0.8%. Hyperreniarufa 
(thatching grass) had the NDF percentage of 23.2±0.38%. 
Acacia spp had the lowest percentage of NDF (26.16±0.64%). 
Analysis of variance showed that there was no significant 
difference in nutrient composition across all the species 
(P<0.05). The concertration of nutrients in the fodder species 
varied with location and the soil characteristics. Areas that 
had high levels for pH, OM, N, P and K had fodder species 
with high content of nutrients (Table 2). For example the 
higher the N the higher the level of CP that was found in the 
fodder species. The amino acids which are found in CP 
contain N which is a clear indicator that N levels have an 
influence on CP levels [16]. A correlation analysis was 
carried out to determine if the level of nutrients was related 
to soil characteristics. It was found out that indeed soil 
characteristics significantly influenced nutrient composition 
in fodder species (R2=0.8126). Ca across all the species was 
significantly different (P<0.05). This means that the 
composition across all the species sampled for the study 
differed. However there were no variations in composition of 
Ca within the samples of the same species (P>0.05). 
Important to note was that Soil nutrient uptake status for the 
fodders studied was different. This further explains the 
variations in nutrient status of the fodder species studied. A 
related study by Kapu [3] also reports that Ca composition in 
fodder species found in rangelands significantly varied across 
all the species studied. This is because the level of Ca 
concertration in the soil directly impacts on how much Ca the 
plant will take in. Grass samples whose P was high had a 
correlation (R2=0.6748) with the soil samples whose 
characteristics especially pH, OM and P were high. This 
shows that soil characteristics influence the level of P in the 
fodder species. Well-structured soils have many pores and 
spaces in the soil to allow good drainage, easy plant root 
growth and efficient uptake of several nutrients including P. 
Soils which are rich in OM are more likely to have high 
concertration of P [17]. K is also an essential nutrient for 
plant growth and large amounts are absorbed from the root 
zone in the production of most fodder and it is classified as a 
macronutrient responsible for biochemical reaction in plants. 
It is as well being associated with movement of water, 
nutrients, and carbohydrates from one part of the plant to 
another as well as the opening and the closing of the stomata 
during the period of photosynthesis. If K is deficient or not 
supplied in adequate amounts, growth of pasture is stunted 
and yields are reduced. There was a significant difference 
between the species in the percentage of NDF (P<0.05). The 
NDF% of a feed is that portion referred to as the cell wall 
fraction which can be digested by the animal. This cell wall 
is correlated to those indigestible fractions of the feed 
(cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin) – [3, 14]. 
4. Conclusion 
The richness of the fodder species studied was low and 
most of the soil samples did not meet the recommended 
levels and concertration of pH, OM, N, P and K. Similarly 
most of the fodder species did not meet the recommended 
levels of nutrients. Spartinaalterniflora (Cord grass)was the 
most abundant fodder specie in in the rangeland. The most 
commonly consumed species in the rangelands was 
Spartinaalterniflora (Cord grass)probably due to its richness 
over the rest. Panicum maximum (Guinea grass) and 
Hyperreniarufa (Jaragua/thatching grass) though highly 
nutritious, were scarce. The scarcest of the fodders was 
Acacia spp. Species richness varied with location. In addition, 
the nutrient levels of the fodder species varied with location 
and soil physical and chemical characteristics. Locations with 
good soil characteristics had high species richness. This 
means that soil characteristics influence species richness. 
Highly grazed areas had lesser species richness which 

43 
Christine Kyoshabire et al.:  Species Richness and Nutritive Values of Fodder and Their Relationship  
 
with Soil Characteristics in Ugandan Rangelands 
suggests that environmental degradation played a big role in 
species richness. The study recommends introduction of 
resting periods for some over grazed parts of the rangeland. 
Quick growing species such as Panicum maximum (Guinea 
grass) are encouraged to supplement the abundant species 
such as Spartinaalterniflora (Cord grass) which is less 
nutritious but highly grazed by the cows. Panicum maximum 
(Guinea grass) should be used for cattle feeding due to its 
nutrient efficiency over the rest of the fodder species.
