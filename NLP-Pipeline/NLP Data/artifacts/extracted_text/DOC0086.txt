ABSTRACT 
Waste water effluent from sewage treatment process contains organic matter 
and other inorganic compounds which are harmful to the environment if not 
treated properly. In particular high levels of BOD5 and COD in the waste water 
effluent pose significant risk on aquatic life through the depletion of dissolved 
oxygen, therefore treating the effluent to the acceptable permissible limits 
is essential for the health of the ecosystems. The study involved assessing the 
use of wood chips activated carbon in the treatment of the waste water 
effluent from the Doko waste stabilization pond and the research involved 
characterization of the waste water effluent in both the wet and dry seasons 
and the mean values of BOD5 and COD in the effluent for the dry season were 
found to be 172.3mg/l and 269.7mg/l and 129.1mg/l and 217.8mg/l for the 
wet season and these were higher than the recommended NEMA standards of 
50mg/l for BOD5 and 100mg/l for COD, the study also evaluated the 
effectiveness of activated carbon in waste water effluent treatment where 
its adsorption behavior was described by the Langmuir and Freundlich models 
and the Freundlich model was the best fit for the adsorption of BOD5 and COD 
by activated carbon. The adsorption process demonstrated maximum 
percentage reductions of 75.6% for BOD5 and 72.4% for COD in the dry season 
and 80.3% for COD, 82% for BOD5 for the wet season bringing the BOD5 and 
COD values to the NEMA acceptable discharge standards demonstrating the 
potential of wood chips activated carbon in waste water effluent treatment.

CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION 
1.1 PROJECT BACKGROUND  
Waste water effluent refers to treated or untreated waste water discharged 
from a treatment facility or from an industry. Effluents are released into 
surface waters but if inadequately treated, they introduce microbial and 
chemical contaminants into public water ways negatively impacting river 
ecosystems and overall water quality (Bessong et al.,2009). Therefore, it is 
essential for wastewater treatment systems to ensure the release of high-
quality effluents into the environment. In many developing countries, waste 
water treatment is often inadequate due to rapid urbanization and population 
growth that results into high hydraulic loadings affecting the capacity of the 
system and the overall design retention time (US EPA., 2009). This is one of 
the challenges experienced here in Uganda in regards to waste water 
treatment as some of the effluents discharged do not meet the NEMA 
standards for discharge of effluent on land or into water. 
In Mbale, there two separate sewer networks, one discharges into the 
Namatala waste stabilization Pond and the other discharges into the Doko 
waste stabilization pond. The waste water from Republic Street, police 
barracks, NWSC offices is treated at the Doko waste stabilization pond and its 
effluent is discharged into the Nashibiso stream. This accounts for the high 
levels of pollution into the stream as it’s the immediate point source of 
pollution (Wolukawu., 2023). Pollution of the Nashibiso stream as a result of 
effluent discharge from the Doko waste stabilization pond has been a major 
concern (Mafabi., 2023) as the people within the neighborhood areas rely on 

 
2 
 
the stream to obtain water for domestic use, the overall water quality of the 
stream is affected by the waste water effluent from the pond.  
The waste water effluent samples from the pond were collected both in the 
dry and wet season and in both the season the values of BOD and COD were 
172.3mg/l, 269.7mg/l for the dry season and 129.1mg/l for BOD and 
217.8mg/l for COD in the wet season which were above the NEMA set 
standards, high BOD and COD in waste water effluents poses severe impacts 
in the environment and ecological systems, excessive BOD and COD levels lead 
to the depletion of dissolved oxygen in receiving waters leading to hypoxic or 
anoxic conditions that harm aquatic life (Metcalf and Eddy., 2014). 
Therefore, it is very key to ensure that the effluent is properly treated before 
it is discharged to ensure the health of the ecosystems and also public health. 
Therefore, the study aims at assessing the use of wood chips activated carbon 
in waste water effluent treatment to act as a polishing unit to the effluent 
before it is discharged to ensure environmental and ecosystem health. 
Wood chips activated carbon is an excellent choice for waste water effluent 
treatment as it’s a highly porous material with a large surface area and the 
pores are made of different shapes and sizes which provides active binding 
sites for BOD and COD adsorption.

1.2 PROBLEM STATEMENT  
Referring to the preliminary results obtained from the effluent in both the 
dry and wet season, some of the parameters of the effluent that was 
discharged from the Doko waste stabilization pond did not meet the standards 
for discharge of effluent into water or land, which were set by NEMA, 1999. 
The mean results on the effluent from the pond for BOD5 and COD were 
172.3mg/l, and 269.7 mg/l respectively for the dry season and 129.1mg/l for 
BOD5 and 217.8mg/l for COD for the wet season and this shows that these 
parameters were higher than the recommended NEMA standards of 50mg/l, 
100mg/l for BOD and COD respectively. The effluent is discharged into the 
Nashibiso stream and this accounts for the high levels of contamination to the 
river (Wolukawu., 2023), and this overtime affects the water quality and the 
aquatic life. The BOD5 and COD values of the water from the stream during 
the dry season were found to be 116mg/l, 170mg/l respectively, this affects 
the quality of the water and also possess risk on aquatic life (Mafabi., 2023). 
High BOD5 and COD levels indicate a significant presence of organic loads, this 
affects the receiving ecosystems through the depletion of dissolved oxygen 
(Sharma., 2021). The purpose of this study is to assess the use of activated 
carbon from wood chips in the reduction of BOD and COD from wastewater 
effluent, wood chips activated carbon has a large surface area, is highly 
porous, the pores on the surface of the activated carbon are of different 
shapes and sizes and this helps to create numerous active binding sites and 
this helps in reducing BOD5 and COD in the waste water effluent.

1.5 JUSTIFICATION 
Wood chips activated carbon is an excellent choice for waste water effluent 
treatment to reduce BOD and COD due to its large surface area and the pore 
structure produced during the process of carbonization and activation, which 
provide excellent adsorptive properties, the activation process significantly 
enhances the number of micro pores and enlarges the meso pores making it 
highly effective in adsorbing the organic matter. The availability of cavities 
or spaces and pores on the activated carbon are vital for the adsorption 
process (Danish and Ahmad., 2018), the pores formed are of different sizes 
and shapes which help to form numerous active binding sites which are free 
for binding with the incoming atoms and molecules, these active binding sites 
increase the adsorption capacity for the organic molecules present in the 
waste water effluent because as the organic molecules are sticking and 
binding onto the wood chips activated carbon their concentration in the 
effluent decreases and this results into a reduction in BOD and COD 
concentration ( Alsubhi et al., 2020). 
The use of wood chips activated carbon demonstrated the potential of 
treating the waste water effluent to reduce the BOD and COD levels from the 
waste water effluent as a percentage reduction of BOD and COD for the dry 
season were 75.6% and 72.4% and for the wet season a percentage reduction 
of 82% and 80.3% for BOD and COD was achieved which shows the potential 
of wood chips activated carbon in the treatment of the waste water effluent.

1.6 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY   
Wastewater treatment works and discharge of effluent affects the people 
downstream of the Nashibiso River in terms of water quality and also affects 
the aquatic life, the presence of the organic loads in water leads to the 
depletion of dissolved oxygen leading to aquatic stress since during 
decomposition of organic matter dissolved oxygen levels reduce and this 
threatens the aquatic life. The study aimed at how to treat the wastewater 
effluent from the Doko waste stabilization pond to reduce on the COD and 
BOD concentration and ensure the effluent meets the set standards of 50mg/ 
and 100mg/l for BOD and COD respectively before it's discharged to ensure 
safety of aquatic life (Farhadian et al., 2019). Wood chips are one of the 
wastes generated daily from various wood work operations like making chairs, 
beds, cupboards, doors, windows, these wood chips in large quantities their 
disposal may become problematic (Mallakpour et al., 2021). Therefore, the 
study looked at how to ensure the health of the public and that of the aquatic 
life through the use of activated carbon from wood chips to reduce BOD and 
COD from the effluent to improve on the quality of the water in the Nashibiso 
stream, to make it safe for use and to also restore the aquatic ecosystem.

1.7 SCOPE OF THE STUDY 
Geographical scope 
The Doko waste stabilization ponds are located in Mbale city south of 
Kampala road. The coordinates of the pond are 10 04’ 50’’ N, 340 10’ 30’’ E. 
Time of scope  
The study was conducted from September 2024 - April 2025 
Content of scope 
The study involved assessing the use of wood chips activated carbon in the 
treatment of the waste water effluent, the physicochemical quality of the 
effluent from the Doko waste stabilization pond were obtained both in the 
wet and dry season to account for the seasonal variations, the values of COD 
and BOD5 from both seasons served as baseline data to assess the 
effectiveness of the wood chips activated carbon in waste water effluent 
treatment to reduce the BOD5 and COD concentrations in the final effluent 
before it is discharged into the Nashibiso stream. 
The study also looked at the design of the waste water effluent treatment 
unit under the comprehensive guidance by the Metcalf and Eddy design 
manual, where a proposed polishing unit to the final effluent was designed 
to ensure the effluent from the pond is further treated in order to meet the 
NEMA effluent discharge standards before its discharged because in both the 
seasons the mean results for BOD5 and COD were above the permissible limits 
of 100mg/l and 500mg/l.

CHAPTER TWO: LITERATURE REVIEW 
2.0 Introduction  
Waste water is composed primarily of water but it also contains a variety of 
pollutants. Its main components include suspended solids, biodegradable 
dissolved organic matter, inorganic substances, nutrients, heavy metals and 
harmful pathogens. The organic fraction typically consists of substances such 
as detergents, proteins, carbohydrates, fats and soaps. Inorganic elements 
include toxic heavy metals like cadmium and mercury. If these contaminants 
are not properly treated, they pose serious threats to the environment and 
public health. 
Wastewater treatment is done as a way of ensuring environmental health, 
however, the discharge of sewage effluent which does not meet the effluent 
discharge standards has increased over the years due the increase in 
urbanization and industrialization and this slows down the objective of 
ensuring environmental health (Shon et al., 2006).  
Globally, recent studies provide an estimate of waste water production and 
management and (Jones et al., 2021) provides an approximation of about 
359.5 billion m3 annually, where about 63% of the waste water is collected 
and 52% of the waste water is treated and this shows that 48% of the 
wastewater is untreated and this calls for more technologies and ways on 
how the waste water is treated and effluents properly discharged (Jones, 
Vliet and Bierkens., 2020). For the waste water that is treated there exist 
standards at which the final effluent from the treatment should meet before 
it is discharged, in Uganda much as wastewater effluent discharge 
permissible limits exist, ensuring compliance to the standards is not done 

 
9 
 
efficiently and this often leads to discharge of effluents which do not meet 
effluent discharge standards. 
2.1 Characteristics of waste water  
Knowing the characteristics of waste water is crucial because it guides the 
effective management, treatment and design of a treatment system. The 
characteristics vary based on its source for example municipal, industrial 
(Welch and Naczk, 1992). The most used characteristic parameters are, 
1. Chemical oxygen demand and biochemical oxygen demand, they provide 
an understanding on the quantity of organic matter present, BOD 
represents the biodegradable organic matter and COD represents total 
organic matter. 
2. pH and electrical conductivity are indicators of ions in the waste water. 
3. Heavy metals and Inorganic salts which are indicators of Industrial 
pollution. 
4. Nitrogen and phosphorus, these are nutrients when discharged cause 
eutrophication. 
2.1.1 Types and Sources of waste water  
1. Domestic waste water, this is waste water that is discharged due to 
human activities, waste water from toilets essentially consists of organic 
matter, domestic waste water from kitchens, bathrooms and the daily 
discharge varies depending on for example the hygiene conditions and 
these waste waters contain organic matter and also products such as 
detergents and phosphate. 
 

 
10 
 
Types of domestic waste water  
Grey water or sullage is the domestic waste water exclusive of toilet waste, 
water from the kitchen and involves waste water from sinks, bathrooms. 
Black water, contains excreta, flush water and cleansing materials. It 
contains both fecal matter and urine. 
Brown water, contains fecal matter, flush water minus urine, this mainly 
applies to urine diverting toilets. 
2. Industrial waste water, this includes discharges from industrial processes 
and the composition depends on the processes in an industry and the 
waste water maybe from a tannery industry, textile industry, breweries 
industry, chemical industry and all these produce waste waters of 
different composition and treatment is required to ensure environmental 
health. 
2.2 Waste water treatment techniques  
2.2.1 Non-conventional waste water treatment techniques  
Biological treatment relies on microorganisms to break down organic matter, 
it is a natural process and may take a couple of days. Under biological 
treatment, 
stabilization 
ponds, 
trickling 
filters, 
activated 
sludge, 
constructed wetlands are the techniques used to treat the waste water 
effluent  
1. Waste stabilization ponds  
Stabilization ponds are open flow through basins especially designed and 
constructed to aid in the treatment of sewage and biodegradable industrial 

 
11 
 
wastes. Since they rely on biological processes, use long retention time 
usually a number of days to treat the waste water. 
Waste stabilization ponds are one of the cost-effective methods of municipal 
waste water treatment, they are not used in the treatment of toxic waste 
water as it kills the microorganisms, the ponds rely on microbial activity. 
Waste stabilization ponds are mainly used in hot climates, since they rely on 
the microorganisms to break down the organic matter and the degradation is 
intense when the temperature is high. 
Waste stabilization ponds are arranged and series, the first pond which is the 
anaerobic pond, this is followed by the facultative pond and then the 
maturation pond. 
Operation of the ponds 
I. Anaerobic ponds 
Anaerobic ponds are normally 2-5m deep and receive raw waste water and 
they store solids which settle at the bottom as sludge. Anaerobic ponds do 
not have dissolved oxygen and the microbial population consist of anaerobic 
microorganisms. The organic matter in the influent is broken down through 
fermentation. The anaerobic fermentation process breaks down the organic 
matter into methane and carbon dioxide when molecular oxygen is not 
present. 
The process starts with the organic substrates being hydrolyzed producing 
simpler compounds through the enzymes produced by fermentative bacteria. 

 
12 
 
The next stage is acidogenesis which results into the formation of hydrogen, 
carbon dioxide, acetate and organic acids. 
In the next stage, acetogenesis takes place and the organic acids produced 
are converted into hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and acetate by the acetogenic 
bacteria. And in the last stage methanogenic bacteria reduce carbon dioxide 
to methane by hydrogen utilizing methane bacteria, the gaseous end products 
resulting from the reactions escape to the atmosphere and this way BOD is 
removed from the waste water. Well-designed anaerobic pond provides about 
a 60% removal of BOD5 (Dwivedi., 2022). 
II. Facultative ponds  
Facultative ponds are normally 1-2 m deep. In the facultative ponds, 
treatment occurs in different zones that's to say, the anaerobic zone, the 
aerobic zone. 
An aerobic zone is present at the upper layers of the pond because of the 
availability of oxygen from the photosynthesis of algae and wind aeration, in 
this zone organic matter is broken down aerobically, the aerobic portion of 
the pond helps to guard against the release of odors and enables break down 
of the pollutants by the aerobic bacteria. Deeper in the layers the oxygen is 
not present and this constitutes the anaerobic zone where the at the bottom 
the settled suspended organic matter is broken down anaerobically (Dwivedi., 
2022). 
III. Maturation Ponds 
Maturation ponds come in the waste stabilization pond arrangement. They 
Influent from the facultative ponds flows to the maturation ponds. Maturation 

 
13 
 
ponds are generally shallower than facultative ponds with depth ranging from 
0.5 to 1.5 meters. Their primary purpose is to remove pathogens and they 
also play a notable role in removing nitrogen and phosphorus although they 
contribute to some extent to BOD reduction. 
The ponds maintain good oxygen levels throughout their depth due to the fact 
that they receive lower organic loads than anaerobic and facultative ponds 
(Dwivedi., 2022). 
The final effluent comes from the maturation pond and it's discharged into 
the Nashibiso stream.  
2. Constructed wetlands  
Constructed wetlands are engineered systems designed to mimic the natural 
functions of wetlands for the purpose of treating wastewater. They are 
typically shallow basins filled with soil and planted with water tolerant plants 
like reeds, these plants play a key role in the treatment process by enhancing 
microbial activity and facilitating the transfer of oxygen to the root zone.  
In the context of wastewater treatment, constructed wetlands are often 
used after preliminary treatment stages like from septic tanks, waste water 
treatment facility as the pretreated wastewater flows slowly through the 
root zone and this way the pollutants are removed from the waste water 
effluent (Stanbury et al., 2017). 
3. Activated sludge 
Activated sludge is a mixture of sewage and flocculated activated sludge. In 
the aeration and oxygen is supplied to enable microorganisms break down 

 
14 
 
organic matter, some microorganisms flow to the sedimentation tank and are 
settled out, they clog to the suspended particles and settle down as activated 
sludge. The activated sludge portion is continuously returned to the process 
which increases on the microbial population and activity and in this way the 
waste water becomes treated. 
4. Trickling filters 
Trickling filters biological treatment systems sometimes called percolation 
filters. The filter consists of a rotating distribution system that runs by 
gravity, here the microorganisms are not suspended in the mixed liquid but 
they attach themselves on the fixed bed surface and form a layer of 
biological slime that absorbs and consumes the waste, the slime consist of 
bacteria and the accumulating slime slides off the Individual rocks and is 
collected at the bottom along with treated waste water. 
2.2.2 Conventional waste water treatment   
This incorporates a number of processes for example, pre-treatment, primary 
treatment, biological treatment, secondary treatment and disinfection. 
a) Pre-treatment  
As the waste water enters the treatment plants the large floating objects are 
removed by the screens. The screens can be coarse of fine, the materials that 
are trapped are then removed and disposed off safely either in a landfill, 
incinerated or disposed off in areas designated to receive such wastes. 
b) Primary treatment  
The screened waste water then flows to the primary clarifiers where the 
suspended solids and floating objects are removed. what settles at the bottom 

 
15 
 
is called primary sludge, there are other types of waste other than the 
suspended solids for example soaps, oils, grease and these float on top to 
form scum which can be removed by the help of a skimmer. 
c) Biological treatment  
Under biological treatment, the wastes are broken down biologically and here 
trickling filters, activated sludge systems can be utilized, and waste is broken 
down aerobically. 
d) Secondary treatment  
The waste water then flows to the secondary sedimentation tanks where the 
activated sludge settles at the bottom of the tank, the activated sludge can 
be recycled back to the aeration chamber to increase the microbial activity 
and population, it can be used in biogas production or sent to the sludge 
drying beds.   
Disinfection and discharge  
The waste water produced contains pathogens and disinfection is done to kill 
the pathogens present and mainly chlorine is used and after disinfection the 
waste water effluent is then discharged. NEMA has set the maximum 
permissible limits for the discharge of effluent and that waste water 
treatment plants, waste stabilization ponds and industries discharging 
effluent must meet.

2.3 Adsorption  
Adsorption is the concentration of a solute which maybe molecules dissolved 
or suspended in the liquid phase on the surface of a solid. During adsorption 
molecules bind onto the solid surface or are held of the solid surface by the 
weak intermolecular forces of attraction. 
2.3.1 Types of adsorbents used  
Activated carbon, clay minerals, zeolites and these have proved to be 
efficient in waste water effluent treatment. 
2.3.1.1 Activated carbon  
 Activated carbon refers to carbon rich substances characterized by a highly 
developed internal pore structure. It its extensive surface area along with an 
organized network of micropores and meso pores contribute to its exceptional 

 
17 
 
ability to adsorb contaminants from the waste water effluent. Recognized 
worldwide as one the earliest and most extensively utilized adsorbent, 
activated carbon is commonly employed in the treatment of both municipal 
and industrial waste water to reduce color, various organic and inorganic 
pollutants (Liu et al., 2020). 
2.3.1.2 Types of activated carbon 
The most common forms by which activated can be found include: 
Granular activated carbon, which is mainly used in fixed bed adsorption 
columns. Granular activated carbon can be prepared from hard materials like 
wood, coconut shell and granular activated carbon is mainly used in column 
adsorption units and they can be regenerated after use. 
Powdered activated carbon, this is mainly used when the pollutant 
concentration in waste water is low as they can be clogged easily though they 
have a high surface area for waste waters with high pollution loads for 
example high levels of suspended solids, granular activated carbon is suitable 
as it reduces on the frequency of clogging and for waste waters with low 
contaminants then powdered activated carbon is suitable (Tariq et al., 2022).  
2.3.1.3 Methods activation 
1. Physical activation  
Physical activation is also referred to as thermal activation, it is widely used 
in the production of activated carbon. The first stage involves carbonization 
where the biomass such as wood chips undergo thermal decomposition at 
temperatures between 400-600˚C, using the wood chips or any other material 
without treatment, it leads to the increase in organic matter after they 
decompose, carbonization removes volatile compounds yielding a carbon rich 

 
18 
 
char. This method yields activated carbon with well-developed porous 
structure and is considered more environmentally friendly than the chemical 
activation 
2. Chemical activation 
Chemical activation involves treating the carbonaceous precursors with 
chemical activating agents such as phosphoric acid, potassium chloride, zinc 
chloride prior to thermal treatment. The method is particularly effective for 
biomass rich in cellulose and lignin (Sumangala et al., 2021).  
2.3.1.4 wood chips activated carbon  
In the selection of the type of tree species to be used for production of 
activated carbon, it depends on its carbon content and cellular structure 
hardwood like eucalyptus have a complex cellular structure which produces a 
porous material as compared to soft woods. The wastes from the wood 
industry are cheaper and available in large quantities. Besides Eucalyptus 
wood chips having a good cellular structure, the waste is plentiful by product 
of the wood industry. According to approximate analysis, raw eucalyptus 
wood chips have a fixed carbon content of 51.99% making it an excellent 
biomass for the production of activated carbon (Moрoung.,2021).  
Carbonization and activation are key steps for activated carbon production; 
they help in the determination of the surface properties and porosity of the 
adsorbent.  
 

 
19 
 
2.4 Adsorption isotherms 
Adsorption is the mass transfer process characterized by the accumulation of 
substances on the surface of the adsorbate. The equilibrium relationship 
between the adsorbent and the adsorbate is typically described by the 
adsorption isotherms at a constant temperature. Accurately fitting 
experimental data to various isotherm models is essential for identifying the 
most suitable model for adsorption design. 
Equilibrium adsorption isotherms are critical in designing adsorption systems 
as they help assess the adsorption potential of activated carbon for specific 
contaminants. A wide range of isotherm models exist and the most widely 
used adsorption isotherms used are Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption 
isotherms. The Freundlich adsorption isotherm assumes that adsorption takes 
place in the multilayer while Langmuir adsorption isotherm assumes 
adsorption takes place in a monolayer (Rani et al., 2021).

3.3 Sample collection  
The sampling bottles were clearly labeled with the date and time of 
collection and the wastewater effluent samples were collected from the 
Doko waste stabilization pond discharge point and from the Nashibiso stream, 
a clean bottle was triple rinsed with the effluent to avoid contamination and 
it was used to collect and transfer the samples into the clean sampling 
bottles which were filled to the mark to allow for proper sealing, grab 
samples in field triplicates were collected to obtain representative sample. 
The samples were collected in the morning, afternoon and evening to 
account for the variations in the effluent composition and the samples were 
collected in the wet and dry seasons to account for the seasonal variations. 
Grab sampling was employed to collect the samples both in the wet and dry 
seasons, clean sampling bottles were first rinsed with the waste water 
effluent sample to avoid contamination. 
Since the lab was not within the same locality with where the waste water 
effluent samples were collected, the samples were placed in the cooler box 
containing ice packs for preservation during transportation to the laboratory 
for analysis (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, EPA). 
3.4 Determination of physiochemical quality of the waste water effluent   
Determination of the biochemical oxygen demand BOD (APHA 5210B) 
This was determined using the Azide modification of Winkler method (oxygen 
electrode method) 
Materials and equipment  
 BOD test bottles  

 
22 
 
 DO meter 
 Incubator  
 Dilution water  
 Graduated cylinder  
 Pipette  
Reagents used  
 Phosphate buffer solution  
 Magnesium sulphate solution  
 Calcium chloride solution 
 Ferric chloride solution 
Procedure  
I. The dilution water was prepared by adding water to a bottle and 
saturating it with dissolved oxygen by aerating with organic free 
filtered air, and this was followed by the addition of the nutrient stock 
solution of phosphate buffer, calcium chloride, Ferric chloride, and 
magnesium sulfate 1ml each per a liter of saturated water. The 
nutrients are added to ensure that the microorganisms have sufficient 
inorganic nutrients while decomposing the organic matter and the 
nutrients do not contribute to the consumption of dissolved oxygen in 
the waste water sample solution. 
II. 5ml of the sample were added to a 300ml beaker and the dilution water 
added up to the 300ml mark and stirred. 
III. The initial DO of the samples was measured using an already calibrated 
DO meter. The samples were then added to the 300ml BOD bottles and 

 
23 
 
filled to the brim and closed with a stopper to prevent the penetration 
of oxygen. 
IV. The BOD bottles were amber in color to prevent light penetration 
which promotes photosynthesis. 
V. The BOD bottles are then placed in an incubator at a temperature of 
20°C for 5 days. The final dissolved oxygen of the samples was then 
obtained. 
VI. The initial dissolved oxygen (D1) was subtracted from the final 
dissolved oxygen (D2) and multiplied by the dilution factor which is the 
ratio of the volume of the BOD bottle to the sample volume. The 
biochemical oxygen demand is then obtained from; 
 BOD (mg/l) = (𝐷1 −𝐷2) × 𝑑𝑖𝑙𝑢𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟 
Determination of the chemical oxygen demand COD (APHA 520D) 
Chemical oxygen demand (COD) determination was achieved using the closed 
reflux method. 
The principle is that under acidic conditions a strong oxidizing agent will 
oxidize the organic compounds to carbon.  
Preparation of the reagents 
The reagents required for the experiment were; 
 Concentrated sulfuric acid  
 Potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7).  
 Waste water samples 
Apparatus required  
 Thermal reactor  
 Spectrophotometer  

 
24 
 
 Test tubes or vials  
 Pipette  
Procedure 
I. 2ml of the wastewater effluent sample were placed in a test tube or vial  
II. 2ml of potassium dichromate were then added to the waste water 
effluent sample as a strong oxidizing agent. 
III. 2ml of concentrated sulfuric acid followed, this was to provide an acidic 
environment so that complete and better oxidation of organic matter can 
be done due to potassium dichromate. 
IV. The vials or test tubes were closed tightly and shaken lightly as it may 
explode, care is taken because it becomes hot due to the exothermic 
reaction of sulfuric acid. 
V. The test tubes were then placed in a thermal reactor at a temperature of 
150°C for 2 hours, after the two hours the digestor is switched off, and 
the test tubes are removed and left to cool to room temperature for about 
one hour. 
VI. The test tubes were then placed in the spectrophotometer set at a wave 
length of 620nm and the COD values read. This change in absorbance from 
the dichromate solution is directly proportional to the COD of the sample 
in mg/L.

from the electrode, the electrode is stored in a potassium chloride buffer 
and is never allowed to dry.  
II. The probe was then rinsed with distilled water and dried with tissue, the 
calibration button on the pH meter was pressed and the probe inserted 
into a pH buffer 7 first, and when the pH was adjusted up to 7 the probe 
was removed from the buffer 7 solution, rinsed and dried, the probe was 
then placed in the pH buffer 4, and when the pH was adjusted to 4 the 
probe was removed rinsed and dried. The wasted water Effluent samples 
were shake well to obtain a uniform mixture and placed in a beaker rinsed 
using waste water and the pH values for the samples were taken.

3.5 Determination of the reduction of BOD and COD from the waste water 
effluent  
3.4.1 Wood chips collection and preparation 
The wood chips were obtained from lucky star workshop in Mbale city, 
washed with clean water to remove any impurities like sand and wood dust. 
After washing, the wood chips were dried under the sun for four days to 
lower the moisture content. 
3.4.2 Production of the wood chips activated carbon  
I. The dried wood chips were then transported to a furnace in katosi 
where they were burnt at a temperature of 500°C for 3 hours, at this 
temperature the properties of the char are not distorted and the ash 
content is low compared to the carbon content. 
II. The produced char was crushed where the different particle sizes 
were obtained and sieve analysis was performed to enable us obtain 
the effective particle size of the activated carbon. 
III.  A number of 8 sieves were staked placed on the electrical shaker and 
left to run for five minutes 
IV. The mass retained on each sieve was noted and recorded and a graph 
of percentage passing against sieve size was plotted and the effective 
grain size was obtained which is the D10 from the graph, an effective 
grain size of 0.6mm was obtained with was in the recommended range 
of 0.6-0.9mm (Metcalf and Eddy.,2003). 

 
28 
 
V. The 0.6mm wood chips particles were washed to remove any dust and 
activated with phosphoric acid and this was aimed at increasing the 
surface area and porosity of the produced activated carbon. 
3.4.3 The reduction of BOD and COD from the waste water effluent 
1. The waste water effluent was passed through the prepared activated 
carbon at different column lengths, the first column was the control, 
no activated carbon was added and the control acted as the base line 
condition to determine how much of the organic matter has been 
reduced from the effluent. 
2. Four bottles were prepared and packed with activated carbon at the 
lengths of 100mm, 140mm, 180mm, 220mm. cotton as a support 
material was placed at the bottom of the bottle to prevent carbon loss 
during the experiment, a flow rate of 7ml/min was established for all 
the columns, and this was determined by placing a hole at the bottle 
cover using the nail, and then determining how long it takes for the 
effluent in the bottle to flow out. The initial and final BOD5 and COD 
values were obtained following the APHA standards and the reduction 
was calculated by getting the difference in initial and final 
concentrations divided by the initial concentration. 
3.4.4 Batch adsorption experiment. 
1. A fixed amount of waste water effluent, 1000ml was added to the 
different jars and different amounts of activated carbon were added 
for example 0g, 10g, 20g, 30g and 40g, the first jar no activated carbon 
was added and this was used as a blank. 

 
29 
 
2. A stirrer was used to mix the samples thoroughly in a rotary sequence 
until equilibrium was achieved. Equilibrium occurs when the further 
adsorption does not occur. The experiment was carried out in the 
laboratory at a room temperature of 23˚C. 
3. The concentration after equilibrium Ce was obtained, the minimum 
amount of time allowed for the samples to achieve adsorption 
equilibrium was 4hours. 
4. After the end of the test period following the APHA standards the final 
BOD5 and COD concentrations were obtained and the results were 
analyzed and then plotted to get the adsorption isotherms.(Wegmann 
et al. 2011). 
3.4.5 Breakthrough curve experiment 
1. A column test was carried out to obtain the design parameters. A feed 
with a constant concentration Co of the waste water effluent was 
passed through the fresh activated carbon bed at a constant flow rate 
of 7ml/min, the waste water effluent was allowed flow through the 
column packed with activated carbon continuously.  
2. The samples were collected at the bottom at different intervals of time 
and the samples were analyzed to obtain the concentration of BOD5 
and COD. The initial concentration and final concentrations at the 
different time intervals were obtained and a graph of concentration 
ratio against time was plotted to give the breakthrough curve which 
was used to obtain the breakthrough and exhaustion time (Chang et al., 
2006). 

 
30 
 
3.5 Design of a waste water effluent treatment unit  
This was achieved under comprehensive guidance by the Metcalf and Eddy 
design manual. 
The design considerations included, 
Empty bed contact time, the time the waste water effluent remains in 
contact with the activated carbon. 
Bed depth, an adequate bed depth ensures sufficient contact between the 
waste water and the carbon bed, the bed depth is very crucial as it affects 
the exhaustion time and the breakthrough time, increase in the bed length 
increases the exhaustion time as it takes a long time for the mass transfer 
zone to reach the bottom of the bed, this in turn reduces the time needed 
the frequently replace the activated carbon or subject it to regeneration. 
But also, when scaling up the bed length should not exceed the 
recommended range of 1.8-4m as at higher depths it would result into 
overlapping of the active binding sites which reduces the efficiency of the 
bed. 
Flow rate, the flow rate affects the contact time, adsorption capacity and a 
low flow rate allows for longer contact time between the activated carbon 
and the effluent leading do better adsorption capacities.

CHAPTER FOUR: RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
4.0 Introduction  
This chapter presents the findings obtained from the various experiments 
done on the effluent samples. Grab samples of the waste water effluent from 
the Doko waste stabilization pond both in the wet and dry seasons were used 
as the baseline data which was used to assess the effectiveness of the 
activated carbon in waste water effluent treatment.

effluent.

The wastewater effluent quality results from the Doko waste stabilization 
pond were compared with the NEMA standards for discharge of effluent on 
land or water and the results show a significant deviation from the permissible 
limit particularly the BOD5 and COD. 

 
32 
 
 
 
Figure 1: BOD concentration variation with time 
An average BOD5 value of 172.3±3.6mg/l which was above the NEMA set 
standard of 50mg/l was discharged into the stream. 
The high BOD5 values in the effluent are mainly due to the reduction in the 
retention time in the anaerobic and Facultative ponds yet most of the BOD is 
removed them, reducing the time the waste water spends in ponds, reduces 
the breakdown of organic matter leading to the rise in BOD5 values. From the 
analysis it was observed that much as the pond design meets the design 
standards for designing waste stabilization ponds, it was observed that there 
was a considerable reduction in the retention time in the anaerobic and 
facultative ponds and this affects the breakdown of BOD. A well-functioning 
anaerobic pond removes 60% of BOD, reduction in retention time affects 
sedimentation and degradation of the organic matter in the ponds affecting 
the breakdown of organic matter in the ponds. The BOD5 value deviations 
throughout the day are mainly due to the increase in microbial activity which 
increases the breakdown organic thus reducing the BOD5 (Badre et al., 2023).

Figure 2: COD concentration variation with time 
An average COD value of 269.7±4.2mg/l in the effluent was discharged into 
the Nashibiso stream which was beyond the NEMA set standard of 100mg/l 
and this high COD value is mainly attributed to the reduction in the retention 
time of the ponds this could be due to the increase in the hydraulic loading 
of the ponds affecting their design capacity and the design retention time 
thus reducing the efficiency of the ponds in effectively treating the waste 
water effluent to the required COD values.

A pH range of the effluent from the pond was between 8.3-8.7±0.1, the rise 
in the pH in effluent is mainly due to the dissociation of carbonate and bi 
carbonate ions in the ponds which leads to the release of hydroxyl ions which 
leads to a rise in the pH values in the effluent.  
 
 
    
 
Figure 4: TSS concentration variation with time 
 
On average, TSS value of 87.9±2.4mg/l which was within the recommended 
NEMA permissible limit for effluent of 100mg/l was discharged into the 
Nashibiso stream, this means the suspended solids in the effluent actually 
have enough time to settle out of suspension, the solids which settle out 
become sludge and desludging of the ponds is done annually to ensure their 
efficiency in waste water effluent treatment.

Figure 5: EC variation with time 
The EC range in the final effluent was between 860.2-900.2±11.8μS/cm, the 
electrical conductivity of the effluent was within the recommended NEMA 
permissible limit of 1500μS/cm. Increase in the EC values is mainly due to 
evaporation which leaves the dissolved salts and ions that do not evaporate 
and these contribute to the rise in EC values.

The higher the concentration of organic matter in the waste water the 
stronger it is said to be. Waste water strength is often judged by its BOD and 
the strength of the waste water is governed by the water consumption, in 
developing countries like Uganda the water consumption is low usually an 
estimate of 40-100l per person which makes the waste water strong. 
 
 
Figure 6: BOD concentration variation with time 
An average BOD value of 129.1±3.5 was discharged from the pond in the wet 
season which was higher than the NEMA effluent discharge standard, the BOD 
value for the wet season were lower than that of the dry season because the 
waste stabilization ponds operate in the open therefore when it rains the rain 
water helps to dilute the waste water present in the ponds, reducing its 
strength, and this makes the BOD values in the effluent to be lower than the 
ones for the dry season, therefore the reduction is primarily because of the 
dilution effect from the rain.
