ABSTRACT 
The role of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises in shaping the economic landscape 
of Uganda cannot be overstated. These businesses serve as vital engines of growth, 
employment generation, and poverty reduction within the nation. The purpose of this 
paper was to discuss obstacles to Exporting by Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises 
in Uganda. It seeks to unravel the factors that hinder these enterprises from realizing 
positive outcomes through their export, thereby impeding their goal of expanding 
sales. The research was guided by three objectives which are: (i) to identify the 
existing export policies and regulations of MSMEs in Uganda. (ii) to identify 
financial barriers faced by MSMEs in accessing capital for export activities in 
Uganda. (iii) to examine the training opportunities for MSMEs to enhance their export 
capacities in Uganda. The study utilized the content analysis research design, utilizing 
a qualitative research approach. The study focused on micro, small, and medium 
enterprises in Uganda. The Data utilized was drawn from secondary data sources 
which included various documents, on objective one, the study findings revealed that 
the existing export policies and regulations in Uganda provide a structured framework 
for international trade, ensure compliance with quality standards, mitigate risks, offer 
access to incentives, and open the door to global markets for MSMEs. On objective 
two, the study findings revealed that financial barriers for MSMEs seeking capital for 
export activities in Uganda have far-reaching implications for economic development, 
job creation, poverty reduction, and the country’s global competitiveness. On 
objective three, the study findings revealed that training opportunities, enhance long-
term sustainability, global competitiveness, export compliance, collaboration, and 
networking, which fosters economic growth. I would recommend the government 
simplify export procedures, provide targeted financial support, expand export training, 
promote collaboration among MSMEs, offer market information access, facilitate 
advocacy, and establish effective monitoring mechanisms to help MSMEs overcome 
export obstacles and thrive in international trade.

1. INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Background 
The various export marketing strategies among different Micro, Small, and Medium 
Enterprises have drawn significant attention from researchers, export managers, and 
policymakers (Sousa et al., 2008; Lages, 2003; Mohamad et al., 2009).  
This attention has been prompted by the low export rates in Uganda compared to imports, 
leading to a desire to increase the country's exports and improve the survival of Micro, Small, 
and Medium Enterprises. Researchers and policymakers, such as Zou and Stan (1998) and 
Sousa et al. (2008), have concluded with evidence that export marketing strategies are critical 
determinants and antecedents of a firm's general export performance (Lages, 2003; Leonidou 
et al., 2002). These marketing strategies encompass the marketing plan's elements, including 
product, pricing, distribution, and promotion, collectively known as the marketing mix.  
Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises play a vital role in Uganda's economic development, 
innovation, and wealth creation, with a significant presence across sectors, employing over 
2.5 million people and contributing substantially to the private sector's output and the gross 
domestic product (Uganda Investment Authority, 2016). As Uganda strives to harness the 
opportunities presented by the global market, understanding the intricate interplay between 
export marketing strategies, market competitiveness, and export performance becomes 
imperative for the sustained development of its Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises sector. 
Export marketing strategies represent a multifaceted approach employed by Micro, Small, 
and Medium Enterprises to navigate the complexities of international markets (Leonidou et 
al., 2017). These strategies encompass critical elements such as product design, pricing 
tactics, distribution channels, and promotional endeavors (Cadogan et al., 2015). Effectively 
aligning these strategies with market demands and competitive forces can significantly 
impact export performance, enabling Micro, Small, and medium Enterprises to expand their 
market share and profitability (Li & Ye, 2020; T sai et al., 2019). 
The concept of market competitiveness introduces a nuanced layer to this relationship. The 
degree of market competitiveness influences the effectiveness of export marketing strategies, 
shaping the outcomes of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises endeavors on the global 
stage (Cavusgil & Zou, 2012). In highly competitive markets, strategic marketing efforts are 

2 
paramount to capturing the attention of international buyers and gaining a competitive edge 
(Zou & Cavusgil, 2002). Hence, market competitiveness is posited to mediate the connection 
between export marketing strategies and export performance. 
Government support and technological advancement are integral external factors that can 
significantly influence Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises export endeavors (Nkamnebe 
& Ugwu, 2018; Oviawe & Oludayo, 2019). Government policies, financial incentives, and 
trade facilitation measures can bolster the impact of export marketing strategies, amplifying 
the competitive advantage of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises World Bank, 2020). 
Furthermore, technological adoption, encompassing digital marketing tools and e-commerce 
platforms, offers Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises an avenue to enhance their global 
reach and marketing effectiveness (Donthu & Garcia, 2020). 
The export experience of Micro, Small, and Medium enterprises further contributes to this 
intricate web of relationships. Previous export engagements endow Micro, Small, and 
Medium Enterprises with valuable insights, knowledge, and capabilities that augment the 
potential effectiveness of their marketing strategies (Bell & McNaughton, 2013; Bilkey & 
Tesar, 1977). Leveraging past experiences, Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises can fine-
tune their strategies to align with market demands and gain a competitive edge. 
Given these issues, this conceptual framework will serve as a compass for this research. I 
contend that the harmonic interplay of export marketing tactics, market competitiveness, 
government assistance, technological advancement, and export experience influences 
Ugandan Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises' export performance. I hope to shed light on 
the factors of export success and add substantially to the conversation on the growth and 
sustainability of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises in Uganda's dynamic economic 
landscape by investigating these interrelationships in depth. 
1.2 Statement of the problem  
Despite concerted efforts by the government and various stakeholders to promote exports in 
Ugandan Micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises, persistent challenges continue to 
thwart their pursuit of export growth and the attraction of variable local and international 
investors (African Export-Import Bank, 2020). These formidable challenges, ranging from 
infrastructural deficiencies to regulatory hurdles, act as substantial roadblocks that hinder 
MSMEs from realizing tangible benefits from their export marketing strategies ( UNDP 

3 
Uganda, 2019). Consequently, the primary objective of these MSMEs which is to expand 
their sales and tap into international markets, remains elusive (Uganda Investment Authority, 
2018).  
1.3 General objective of the study  
The general objective of this research is to examine the obstacles to exporting by micro, 
small, and medium enterprises in Uganda. 
1.4 Specific objectives  
 
• To identify the existing export policies and regulations of MSMEs in Uganda.

2. LITERATURE REVIEW 
2.1 Introduction  
Micro, small, and medium enterprises are the backbone of Uganda’s economy, contributing 
significantly to employment, income generation, and economic growth (World Bank, 2017. 
These enterprises encompass a diverse range of industries, from agriculture to manufacturing 
and services. Exporting offers MSMEs a pathway to increased revenue and market expansion 
beyond Uganda’s borders.  
2.2Theoretical Framework 
There are several theoretical perspectives for understanding the Obstacles to Exporting by 
Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises in Uganda. Previous studies have utilized the 
knowledge-based theory, and some have utilized the Keynesian theory, of comparative 
advantage. In today’s business world, many organizations identify their internal environment 
factors which include strength and opportunities, and external factors which include 
opportunities and threats (Weihrich, 1982). 
 
Comparative advantage refers to the unique strengths and advantages that these enterprises 
possess, allowing them to produce goods and services more efficiently or effectively than 
their competitors, both domestically and in international markets. Comparative advantage is 
achieved when a company produces goods or services for a lower opportunity cost than the 
other countries. In the context of MSMEs, comparative advantage focuses on identifying and 
leveraging the specific strengths and capabilities that these enterprises possess.  
Keynesian theory outlines the role of government intervention and economic policies in 
managing and stimulating economic activities to support the growth and stability of these 
enterprises. The Keynesian theory explains the situation using the two concepts which 
include the marginal efficiency of capital and effective demand. (Keynes, 1933). Thus the 
theory suggests the intervention of government in the economy to enhance the aggregate 
demand specifically using the fiscal and monetary policy instruments. In the context of 
MSME exports in Uganda, this theory can be employed to understand how government 
policies influence the export environment for these enterprises (Keynes, 1936). 

6 
Resource base view is an approach of strategy formulation aimed at attaining a competitive 
advantage based on the organization's resources (Ong et al. 2010b).  It focuses on how these 
enterprises can leverage their unique internal resources and capabilities to achieve and sustain 
a competitive advantage.  Resource-based view is how it is applied to MSME's resource 
identification, core competencies, and distinctive capabilities. According to Barney (1991), a 
resource-based view allows organizations to look for competitive advantage within 
themselves rather than outsiders. Barney, J.B. (1991) Journal of Management, 17(1), 99-120. 
In summary, the discussed theories relate to the business world, in simple terms the theories 
indicate the importance of improving or establishing firm stability conditions through 
enhanced competitiveness. 
2.3 Characteristics of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises in Uganda  
Micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises constitute a vital segment of the business 
landscape, contributing significantly to economic growth, job creation, and innovation. This 
paper examines key characteristics that distinguish micro, small, and medium enterprises 
from larger enterprises, drawing insights from prominent literature in the field. 
a) Scale of Operations: Micro, small, and medium enterprises are renowned for their 
modest scale of operations. Defined by a restricted number of employees, a compact 
physical footprint, and comparatively lower turnovers (Characteristics of Micro, 
Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises: A Literature Review, 2011). 
b) Workforce Size: Typically, Micro, small, and medium enterprises maintain a 
workforce of fewer than 50 employees, which sets them apart from larger corporate 
entities (The Impact of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises on Economic Growth: 
A Review of the Literature, 2016). 
c) Financial Thresholds: Distinguishing micro, small, and medium enterprises from their 
larger counterparts are discernible financial thresholds, often hinging on annual 
turnover or employee count (The Role of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises in 
Job Creation: A Review of the Evidence, 2015). 
d) Ownership Structure: Micro, small, and medium enterprises are frequently 
characterized by an owner-manager configuration, where proprietors actively engage 
in daily operations (The Challenges Faced by Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises 
in Developing Countries: A Review of the Literature, 2015). 

7 
e) Industry Diversity: Across a multitude of industries, Micro, small and medium 
enterprises make their presence felt, encompassing sectors such as manufacturing, 
retail, and services (The Role of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises in Inclusive 
Growth: A Review of the Evidence, 2015). 
f) Geographical Distribution: While often situated in rural or suburban locales, Micro, 
small, and medium enterprises are not confined to such settings; they also thrive in 
urban environments (Characteristics of Micro, Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises: 
A Literature Review, 2011). 
g) Innovation Prowess: Micro, small, and medium enterprises exhibit a penchant for 
innovation, often spearheading the adoption of new technologies and pioneering 
business practices (The Impact of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises on 
Economic Growth: A Review of the Literature, 2016). 
h) Employment Generation: A cornerstone of job creation, Micro, small, and medium 
enterprises furnish substantial employment opportunities globally (The Role of Micro, 
Small, and Medium Enterprises in Job Creation: A Review of the Evidence, 2015). 
i) Economic Impact: With tangible contributions to economic growth, employment 
augmentation, and innovation, Micro, small, and medium enterprises underscore their 
significance in the broader economic context (The Challenges Faced by Micro, Small, 
and Medium Enterprises in Developing Countries: A Review of the Literature, 2015). 
The distinct characteristics of micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises underscore 
their pivotal role in driving economic progress and fostering innovation. This synthesis of 
characteristics, informed by comprehensive literature, illuminates the unique nature and 
significance of micro, small, and medium enterprises in the global business ecosystem. 
2.4. Obstacles to exporting Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises in Uganda  
When it comes to the MSMEs in Uganda entering into foreign markets through exporting 
different studies, researchers find it hard to explain and illustrate the possible and existing 
obstacles that MSMEs are likely to face during their operation. Micro, Small, and Medium 
Enterprises (MSMEs) play a crucial role in the development of developing countries, 
including Uganda. However, they face numerous obstacles that hinder their growth and 
success through the exportation of their products. Drawing on existing literature and theories 
below are some of the obstacles that are highly hindering the MSMEs. The obstacles 
encountered by MSMEs in Uganda are multifaceted and interconnected. Addressing these 

8 
challenges requires a comprehensive approach that considers the specific needs of MSMEs in 
Uganda's context. Policymakers should therefore focus on eliminating and finding the 
solution to the problem before the problems interface in the companies. Below are the 
possible obstacles explained  
❖ Financial Constraints, One of the most significant obstacles faced by MSMEs in 
Uganda is financial constraints. MSMEs often lack access to financing options due to 
limited collateral, high interest rates, and short repayment periods. This limitation 
hinders their ability to invest in business growth and operations, leading to lower 
productivity and competitiveness (Kiggundu, 2015). Moreover, the high cost of credit 
and limited access to financial services restricts MSMEs' ability to manage risks and 
absorb shocks (Akinci & Senses, 2014). According to the Theory, Finance constraint 
theory suggests that small firms face liquidity problems due to information 
asymmetry between lenders and borrowers, resulting in higher transaction costs for 
small firms (Stiglitz & Newman, 1999). 
 
❖ Limited Access to Markets, Another significant obstacle faced by MSMEs in Uganda 
is limited access to markets. MSMEs often struggle to reach consumers and compete 
with larger firms due to inadequate marketing and distribution channels. This limits 
their revenue streams and impedes their ability to scale up production (Nabatanzi et 
al., 2018). Furthermore, inadequate transportation infrastructure and high 
transportation costs make it difficult for MSMEs to reach distant markets (Bagoora & 
Mugisha, 2016).  The resource-based view (RBV) theory posits that firms must 
possess resources and capabilities to achieve sustainable competitive advantage 
(Wernerfelt, 1984). MSMEs in Uganda lack the resources and capabilities to 
overcome market barriers, rendering them less competitive than larger firms. 

9 
❖ Inadequate Infrastructure, Inadequate infrastructure is another significant challenge 
facing MSMEs in Uganda. MSMEs require physical and technological infrastructure, 
such as roads, electricity, water, and telecommunications, to operate efficiently. 
However, these facilities are often in poor condition or non-existent, particularly in 
rural areas where MSMEs are prevalent (Bagoora & Mugisha, 2016). As a result, 
MSMEs incur additional costs and experience operational challenges, hindering their 
growth and profitability (Katono et al., 2017). According to the existing theory: The 
concept of agglomeration economies argues that firms benefit from locating near each 
other, sharing resources, and knowledge spillovers (Glaeser et al., 1994). MSMEs in 
Uganda miss out on these benefits due to inadequate infrastructure, which isolates 
them and hampers their ability to collaborate and learn from each other. 
❖ Regulatory Environment, Ugandan MSMEs also face regulatory hurdles that hamper 
their growth and operation. Complex licensing requirements, cumbersome tax 
obligations, and inefficient bureaucracy create a challenging business environment 
(Nabyonga-Orem et al., 2019). These regulatory obstacles divert resources away from 
core business activities, increase uncertainty, and discourage entrepreneurship (La 
Porta et al., 2009). The legal origins theory posits that the origin of a country's legal 
system influences the development of its institutions and economic growth (La Porta 
et al., 2009). In Uganda, the legal system based on English common law may not 
adequately protect property rights and enforce contracts, elevating the risk for 
MSMEs and deterring potential entrepreneurs. 
2.5. Impact of these obstacles on the export performance and overall success of Micro, 
Small and Medium Enterprises 
The obstacles outlined above can indeed have a significant impact on the export performance 
and overall success of Micro, Small, and Medium-sized Enterprises in their efforts to engage 
in international trade. These obstacles can create barriers that hinder Micro, Small, and 
Medium Enterprises from effectively entering and competing in foreign markets.  
❖ Limited Financial Resources, Limited financial resources can restrict Micro, Small, 
and Medium Enterprises' ability to invest in market research, product adaptation, and 
distribution channels. This can lead to a lack of competitiveness in terms of product 
quality, branding, and effective market entry strategies. Micro, Small, and Medium 

10 
Enterprises may struggle to reach their target markets and may face difficulties in 
establishing a strong market presence. (Ibeh & Young, 2001). 
 
❖ Information Asymmetry, Information asymmetry can result in poor decision-making 
for Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises. Without accurate and up-to-date 
information about foreign markets, Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises may enter 
markets without a clear understanding of consumer preferences, regulatory 
requirements, and market trends. This can lead to misalignment between their 
offerings and market demands, potentially resulting in low sales and profitability.  
(Ghauri & Sinkovics, 2000; Ellis & Pecotich, 2001). 
 
 
❖ Lack of Export Expertise, Inadequate export expertise can lead to delays, increased 
costs, and missed opportunities. Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises may struggle 
to navigate complex export procedures, leading to inefficient operations and 
potentially damaging their relationships with foreign partners. This can hinder their 
ability to respond quickly and effectively to market changes and opportunities. 
(Kolvereid & Bullvåg, 1996). 
 
❖ Access to Distribution Networks, Difficulty in identifying and partnering with reliable 
agents, distributors, or intermediaries can limit Micro, Small, and Medium 
Enterprise's reach to target customers. Without a strong distribution network, Micro, 
Small, and Medium Enterprises may face obstacles in effectively reaching and 
delivering their products to customers, leading to suboptimal market penetration and 
revenue generation. (Kotabe & Murray, 1990). 
 
 
❖ Competitive Pressures, Competitive pressures from both domestic and international 
competitors can limit Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises' ability to differentiate 
themselves based on price, quality, or branding. Micro, Small, and Medium 
Enterprises may struggle to establish a unique value proposition in the market, 
making it difficult to capture a significant market share or achieve sustainable 
profitability. (Madsen & Servais, 1997). 
 

11 
❖ Regulatory and Administrative Burdens, Regulatory and administrative burdens can 
strain Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprise's resources and hinder their ability to 
comply with foreign market requirements. This can lead to shipment delays, 
additional costs, and potential legal issues, negatively impacting their reputation and 
relationships with partners. (Brouthers, Geisser, & Rothlauf, 2016). 
2.6. How to overcome these obstacles and achieve export success  
To address these obstacles and enhance their export performance and success, Micro, Small, 
and Medium Enterprises can adopt the following strategies: 
Partnering with Export Intermediaries, Collaborating with export intermediaries can provide 
Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises with access to specialized knowledge, resources, and 
established distribution channels. This can help them overcome barriers related to limited 
resources and expertise, enhancing their market reach and competitiveness. (Madsen & 
Servais, 1997). 
Attending Trade Shows and Events, Participation in trade shows and events can offer Micro, 
Small, and Medium Enterprises opportunities to gather market intelligence, network with 
potential buyers and partners, and showcase their products to a wider audience. This can aid 
in overcoming information asymmetry and building valuable business relationships. (Kotabe 
& Murray, 1990). 
Using Online Platforms, Leveraging online platforms can enable Micro, Small, and Medium 
Enterprises to connect with potential buyers and partners across borders, reducing the 
obstacles of geographical limitations and distribution. Digital tools can facilitate 
communication, transactions, and market research. (Brouthers, Geisser, & Rothlauf, 2016). 
Conducting Market Research, Thorough market research helps Micro, Small, and Medium 
Enterprises understand market dynamics, consumer preferences, and competitive landscapes. 
This knowledge enables them to tailor their products and strategies to align with market 
needs, increasing the likelihood of success. (Ibeh & Young, 2001). 

12 
Building Relationships, Cultivating relationships with key stakeholders, such as buyers, 
distributors, and government officials, can provide Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises 
with essential support and insights. Strong relationships facilitate smoother market entry, 
reduce information gaps, and enhance overall business performance. (Ghauri & Sinkovics, 
2000). 
Getting Involved in Industry Associations, Active engagement in industry associations allows 
Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises to stay updated on industry trends, regulations, and 
export opportunities. Networking within these associations can lead to valuable partnerships 
and collaborations that support export endeavors. (Kolvereid & Bullvåg, 1996).

4. PRESENTATION AND DISCUSSION OF THE FINDINGS 
4.0 Introduction 
This chapter presents findings to research questions in chapter one. These findings were 
obtained from secondary sources of data. 
4.1 Findings  
 
 
4.1.1 The existing export policies and regulations of MSMEs in Uganda 
Export policies and regulations for Micro Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (MSMEs) in 
Uganda are governed by various government agencies and international trade agreements. It's 
important to note that regulations and policies can change over time, so MSMES must stay 
updated on the latest developments through official government sources and business 
associations.  
According to the URA website, every MSMES that wants to engage in exporting business 
must hold an Export Declaration certificate. MSMEs must declare their exports to URA 
through the Single Customs Territory (SCT) system. This system aims to streamline customs 
procedures and reduce trade barriers within the East African Community   (Uganda 
Investment Authority, 2015). 
 Trade Licensing and Permits. MSMEs may need various licenses and permits to engage in 
export activities. The specific requirements may vary depending on the nature of the goods 
being exported. MSMEs should consult with URA and other relevant government agencies 
for guidance (Uganda Investment Authority, 2015). 
Trade Associations and Support Organizations. MSMEs can benefit from joining trade 
associations and business support organizations like the Uganda National Chamber of 
Commerce and Industry (UNCCI) and the Uganda Export Promotion Board (UEPB). These 
organizations provide information, training, and networking opportunities for exporters. 
Quality Standards and Certifications. Depending on the destination market, MSMEs may 
need to comply with specific quality and safety standards. The Uganda National Bureau of 
Standards (UNBS) provides information on standards and can help MSMEs obtain necessary 
certifications (Brown, 2018). 

16 
 Export Financing and Incentives. The Ugandan government and international organizations 
may offer financial support and incentives to MSMEs engaged in export activities. These can 
include grants, loans, and tax incentives (Republic of Uganda, 2015). 
 Customs Procedures and Tariffs. MSMEs must adhere to customs procedures and pay 
applicable tariffs when exporting goods. The East African Community Customs Management 
Act provides guidelines for customs procedures and tariff rates within the EAC (Republic of 
Uganda, 1998). 
 Trade Agreements. Uganda is a member of several regional and international trade 
agreements, including the East African Community (EAC) and the Common Market for 
Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA). MSMEs should be aware of the trade provisions 
and benefits offered by these agreements (Smith, 2019). 
Export Documentation. MSMEs should ensure that they have all the necessary export 
documentation, including invoices, packing lists, certificates of origin, and any required 
permits (Brown, 2018).  
 Export Promotion. The Uganda Export Promotion Board (UEPB) plays a significant role in 
promoting Ugandan exports. MSMEs can access resources and support for market research, 
product development, and export promotion initiatives through UEPB. (Uganda Export 
Promotion Board, 2020). 
4.1.2 Financial barriers faced by MSMEs in accessing capital for export activities in 
Uganda 
The financial barriers faced by MSMEs in accessing capital for export activities in Uganda 
are significant. Studies have consistently highlighted several key challenges in this regard. 
Firstly, limited access to finance is a major barrier.MSMEs often struggle to secure the 
necessary capital to invest in export activities, including financing for production, packaging, 
and shipping (Kakembo, Kasekende, & Mfitumukiza, 2019). Financial institutions in Uganda 
may perceive MSMEs as high-risk borrowers due to factors such as limited collateral and 
inadequate financial records, making it difficult for MSMEs to secure loans (Kakembo et al., 
2019).  
 Secondly, high interest rates and collateral requirements add to the financial barriers faced 
by MSMEs. Banks in Uganda typically charge higher interest rates to compensate for the 

17 
perceived risks associated with lending to MSMEs (Kakembo et al., 2019). Additionally, 
many MSMEs are unable to meet the stringent collateral requirements set by financial 
institutions, further limiting their ability to access capital for export activities. 
 Furthermore, lengthy and bureaucratic loan application processes create obstacles for 
MSMEs seeking capital. The paperwork and administrative requirements involved in 
obtaining financing can be overwhelming for MSMEs with limited resources and expertise 
(Kakembo et al., 2019). 
Inadequate support for capacity building. The research also highlighted the lack of support 
mechanisms for capacity building related to financial management and creditworthiness 
improvement among MSMEs. Many of these enterprises struggle with basic financial literacy 
and record-keeping practices, further limiting their abilities to access credit (Miller, 2019). 
The absence of targeted programs and initiatives for financial education and capacity building 
exacerbates this challenge. 
 Lack of financial literacy. Many MSME owners and entrepreneurs have limited knowledge 
about financial management and accessing credit. This lack of financial literacy hampers 
their ability to navigate the complex financial landscape and effectively access capital for 
export activities (Madichie et al., 2019). 
4.1.3 The training   opportunities for MSMEs to enhance their export capacities in 
Uganda 
In Uganda, several training opportunities exist to enhance the export capacities of Micro, 
Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). These training programs aim to equip MSMEs 
with the necessary knowledge and skills to understand international markets, comply with 
export regulations, and effectively engage in export activities. The following are some key 
training opportunities available for MSMEs in Uganda.  
Uganda Export Promotion Board (UEPB) Training Programs. The UEPB offers various 
training programs and workshops specifically designed for MSMEs to enhance their export 
capabilities. These programs cover a wide range of topics, including export market research, 
product adaptation for international markets, export documentation, trade finance, and market 
entry strategies (UEPB, 2023). For example, the UEPB conducts training on export 
procedures and documentation, providing MSMEs with practical knowledge of the 
requirements and processes involved in exporting goods (UEPB, 2023). 

18 
Uganda Small Scale Industries Association (USSIA). USSIA provides training programs and 
workshops for MSMEs to improve their export capabilities. These programs focus on topics 
such as export market identification, product quality improvement, packaging and labeling 
requirements, and trade negotiations (USSIA, 2023). 
 Private Sector Foundation Uganda (PSFU).PSFU collaborates with various partners to 
organize training programs for MSMEs. These programs cover areas such as export 
marketing, export finance, export pricing strategies, and export risk management (PSFU, 
2023). For instance, PSFU, in collaboration with international trade support institutions, 
offers technical assistance and capacity-building programs to MSMEs, including training on 
international marketing and trade promotion (PSFU, 2023). 
 The International Trade Centre (ITC).The ITC partners with various organizations in Uganda 
to provide capacity-building support to MSMEs in the export sector. They offer training 
programs on export market research, product development, buyer-seller matchmaking, 
international branding, and market access requirements (ITC, 2023). For example, the ITC's 
She Trades initiative provides training and mentorship opportunities specifically for women-
owned MSMEs to enhance their export capacities (ITC, 2023).
