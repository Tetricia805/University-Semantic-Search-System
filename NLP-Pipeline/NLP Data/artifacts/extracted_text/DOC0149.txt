Abstract 
Due to the rise of scientific arguments which are spreading rapidly in all corners of 
the world and Mwanza region which is allocated North West of Tanzania has not been 
left out by this wind. In Tanzania, studies that put a lot of emphasis on scientific 
theories of creation have been given priority and it has happened that a big number 
of people in this area have come across and learnt these scientific theories of 
creation, not only learn but also believe in them. Meanwhile less effort has been 
made by Christians to refute them and this state has led many people in Victoria 
Nyanza Diocese to believe in the scientific theories of creation. This research used 
questioners, interviews, books, websites and articles in gathering information; and 
from these, this study explored and brought into light the effects of scientific theories 
of creation. This paper concluded by designing a strategy for a mission that will 
enable the church tackle the problem. 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
CHAPTER ONE:  
1.0 
THE PROBLEM AND ITS SETTING 
1.1 
Introduction 
Throughout much of the 20th century, opponents of evolution theory many of them 
theologically conservative Christians either have tried to eliminate the scientific 
theories of creation from Tanzanian public school’s curriculum or urged science 
teachers also to teach a version of the creation story found in the biblical book of 
Genesis because of their negative impacts. Though this seems to be an unsolved 
parable due to the fact that the scientific theories of creation are taught in schools. 
When being taught, they are made to believe that evolution is a well-established 
scientific theory that convincingly explains the origins and development of life on 
earth. Moreover, say, a scientific theory is not a hunch but is instead an established 
explanation for a natural phenomenon, like gravity, that has repeatedly been tested 
through observation and experimentation. Not only that but with the material 
evidences found in Old vai gorge, Kondoa Irangi, Mumba cave and Engaruka all these 
allocated within the country, the creation account in Genesis seems to have no place 

 
 
in the hearts and minds of most people in Tanzania due to the fact that less effort has 
been made by Christians to refute these scientific theories of creaton 
The church in the Diocese of Victoria Nyanza is doing its best making new disciples, 
fulfilling the Great Commission (Mathew 28:19) and indeed it is doing its part in 
calling people build the kingdom of God. But at the same time the teaching of 
evolution has become a part of the nation’s culture in all schools and has been taken 
up by legislature and boards of education all over the country of Tanzania. This can 
be referred to the curriculum starting at primary level; Standard 4, 5, 6 and 7, 
Secondary level; Form I, II, III, IV, V, VI; and at university level. The Christians under 
the Diocese of Victoria Nyanza, have either passed, are passing or will pass through 
this system of education. So, this study was conducted so as to study on the effects of 
the scientific theories of creation on the Christians of Victoria Nyanza Diocese. 
1.2 
Statement of the problem 
Whereas studies in Tanzania have put a lot of emphasis on scientific theories of 
creation, less effort has been made by Christians to refute them. This state has led 
many people in Victoria Nyanza Diocese to believe in the scientific theories of 
creation. This study therefore, sought to analyze the effects of these theories on the 
Christians of Mwanza archdeaconry. 

 
 
1.3 
Purpose of the study 
The purpose of this study was to study on the effects of the scientific theories of 
creation on the Christians of Victoria Nyanza Diocese specifically those of Mwanza 
Archdeaconry. Not only that but also to suggest and highlight the roles of the church 
in helping people that have been affected and those that are yet to be affected by 
the scientific theories of creation.  
1.1. 
Objectives of the study 
The objectives of this study were to; 
Identify the scientific theories of creation. Identify the effects of the scientific 
theories of creation on the Christian life of the Christians. 
Explore the roles of the church in ministering to a person who has been affected and 
help him/her grow spiritually in spite of coming into contact with the scientific 
theories of creation.  

 
 
1.5 
Research Questions 
What are the scientific theories of creation? 
What are the effects of scientific theories of creation in the life of Christians?  
What are the roles of the church in mitigating the effects of the scientific theories 
of creation? 
1.6 
Geographical Scope of the study  
The study was carried out in the Anglican church of Tanzania, Diocese of Victoria 
Nyanza Mwanza Archdeaconry. Mwanza Archdeaconry is found in the Diocese of 
Victoria Nyanza (DVN) which was inaugurated on 16th March 1963. The Diocese is 
among 28 Dioceses under the Anglican Church of Tanzania. Furthermore, it was the 
fifth Diocese of formation out of 28 existing Dioceses of the Anglican Church of 
Tanzania. With effect from this date the Diocese of Victoria Nyanza was separated 
from the Diocese of Central Tanganyika (DCT). Maxwell Wiggins was the first Bishop of 
the Diocese, and the current Bishop of the Diocese is Bishop Zephaniah Ntuza who is 
the fifth Bishop. 

 
 
Geographically the Diocese of Victoria Nyanza is situated on the shores of Lake 
Victoria and lies in Latitude 2° 30′ 59.99″ S and Longitude 32° 53′ 59.99″ E. The 
Diocese covers all districts in Mwanza Region, and some of Geita Region which is one 
of the regions around Lake Victoria.  
On boundaries this Diocese on the east side it is bordered with the district of Bunda, 
on the east side of Mara region. On the west it is delimited with Kagera region, on the 
Northern side it serves to the Island of Ukerewe, whereby from there lays the Lake 
Victoria which is delimited by Uganda. On the southern it is bordered with the region 
of Shinyanga. The physical features of this area are hilly with high mountains and 
large stones and swamps. This vicinity receives abundant rainfall through the year, 
which allows the settlers of this part to cultivate food and cash crops, and also 
engaging in livestock keeping. 
1.7 
Time scope of the study   
This study focused on the effects of scientific theories of creation in Mwanza 
Archdeaconry from the year 2010 to year 2023.  

 
 
1.8 
Significance of the Study 
The study helped the church in becoming aware of the effects of the scientific 
theories of creation and how to tackle them. 
Helped the church leaders understand better their role in the academic world as far 
as providing Christian education is concerned.  
The study guided the church on how to help the people that have been affected or 
are at the verge of losing their faith in God and the church because of the biblical 
account and scientific theories of creation paradigm. 
This study aided those that are struggling on what to believe and are in dilemma, by 
providing a possible way out of the static moment they are passing through. 
1.9 
Limitations of the Study 
This kind of study appears to be of national and international relevance but it will be 
limited to Victoria Nyanza Diocese specifically Mwanza Archdeaconry. 

 
 
1.10 Definition of Terms 
Creation; The word creation has been delivered from old French word creacion which 
means “The act or process of creating, sometimes the fact of being created or 
something that has been brought into existence or created, especially a product of 
human intelligence or imagination the whole universe, including the world and all 
the things in it”1 
Theory; Is a principle that has been formed as an attempt to explain things that have 
already been substantiated by data. It is used in the names of a number of principles 
accepted in the scientific community, such as the Big Bang Theory. Because of the 
rigors of experimentation and control, it is understood to be more likely to be true 
than a hypothesis is. Furthermore, it is a plausible or scientifically acceptable general 
principle or body of principles offered to explain phenomena.2

Scientific; Refers to a process conducted in the manner of science or according to 
results of investigation by science, sometimes practicing or using thorough or 
systematic methods.3 Borrowed from Medieval Latin scientificus it means "producing 
knowledge or relating to knowledge. 
Effects; These are changes which is a result or consequence of an action or other 
cause.4 Effects can also be referred to as things that are produced by an agency or 
cause, result or consequence

CHAPTER TWO:  
2.0 
LITERATURE REVIEW 
2.1 
Introduction  
In this chapter the researcher will have much dealing with what other authors and 
researchers have written, concerning the scientific theories of creation; previewing 
some of the scientific theories of creation specifically the evolution theories, the 
effects of the scientific theories of creation on the Christian life of the Christians and 
the roles of the church in ministering to a person who has been affected and how to 
help him/her grow spiritually in spite of coming into contact with the scientific 
theories of creation. Then the researcher will do a Synthesis of the review and lastly 
will come the new knowledge created by the researcher’s study. 
2.2 
Scientific theories of creation 
When we are to excavate the scientific theories of creation, it would be a great help 
if we keep in mind that “science is a way to understand nature by developing 
explanations for the structures, processes and history of nature that can be tested by 

 
 
observations in laboratories or in thefield” 5 There isn’t just a single theory of 
creation raised by the researchers, scientists, archaeologists, philosophers and all 
those who use reasoning and scientific experimental procedures. Although there are 
many theories of creation in this research paper the researcher will look at some of 
them and will be more concerned with the evolution theory as well as taking a glance 
at the other scientific theories of creation. 
There isn’t just a single theory of creation raised by the researchers, scientists, 
archaeologists, philosophers and all those who use reasoning and scientific 
experimental procedures. Although there are many theories of creation in this 
research paper, we will be more concerned with the evolution theories which are the 
common scientific theories of creation that the people of Mwanza are well aware of.

2.2.1 Evolution Theories 
The theory of evolution is a scientific theory that essentially states that species 
change over time.6 There are many different ways species change, but most of them 
can be described by the idea of natural selection. The theory of evolution through 
natural selection was the first scientific theory that put together evidence of change 
through time as well as a mechanism for how it happens. 
Darwin’s Theory of Evolution 
In 1859 Charles Darwin published a book called On the Origin of Species. This book 
was based on his studies of creatures he had encountered on his travels to many 
overseas locations, including the Galapagos Islands. He put forward the theory “that 
all living creatures that exist today, including human beings, have evolved from

primitive life forms over a period of millions of years”. 7 Here I think that it is 
important if I will explain in brief about the natural selection. 
Natural Selection: Due to variation among different individual, they struggle towards 
their existence with different potentials. The variation in an individual may allow 
him to survive and complete its life cycle comfortable. Whereas, if the variations are 
unfavourable, the individual will struggle against every odd and as a result it may 
not be able to complete the life cycle. In the theory of natural selection, organisms 
produce more offspring than are able to survive in their environment. Those that are 
better physically equipped to survive, grow to maturity, and reproduce. Those that 
are lacking in such fitness, on the other hand, either do not reach an age when they 
can reproduce or produce fewer offspring than their counterparts. Natural selection 
is sometimes summed up as “survival of the fittest” because the “fittest” organisms, 
those most suited to their environment—are the ones that reproduce most 
successfully, and are most likely to pass on their traits to the next generation. 
 
7 
_ Charles Darwin, The Origin of Species: 150th Anniversary Edition (West Bengal, India: 
Signet, 2003) pg. 97. 

 
 
This means that if an environment changes, the traits that enhance survival in that 
environment will also gradually change, or evolve. Natural selection was such a 
powerful idea in explaining the evolution of life that it became established as a 
scientific theory. Biologists have since observed numerous examples of natural 
selection influencing evolution. Today, it is known to be just one of several 
mechanisms by which life evolves. For example, a “phenomenon known as genetic 
drift can also cause species to evolve. In genetic drift, some organisms—purely by 
chance—produce more offspring than would be expected. Those organisms are not 
necessarily the fittest of their species, but it is their genes that get passed on to the 
next generation.”8 
Chemical Evolution 
The term evolution refers to change from one form to another. Change in living 
organism with time is known as organic or biological evolution. The process of 
evolution can be understood from the fact that unicellular organism appears first, 
simple multicellular and later development of complex multicellular organisms such

as seed plants and vertebrate animals. The fishes were the initial early vertebrate 
and it gradually changes to form amphibians. These amphibians have produced 
reptiles and that has evolved further to give birds and mammals. “Man is an animal, 
and however greatly his present state differs from that of the rest of the animal 
kingdom, we must accept that he arose from subhuman ancestors by a process of 
evolution” 9  argues Carter. These hierarchical linking of different species is 
considered by ladder of chain by Aristotle as given in Figure 1.1 In the same series, 
mammals have evolved to human involving ape-like primates by acquiring changes 
over the course of time

2.3 
Evidences brought forward that support scientific theories of creation. 
 Fossil Evidence in Tanzania 
Olduvai Gorge is a site in Tanzania that holds the earliest evidence of the existence 
of human ancestors. Paleoanthropologists have found hundreds of fossilized bones 
and stone tools in the area dating back millions of years, leading them to conclude 
that humans evolved in Africa. The fossils are the remains or impression of the 
ancient organism preserved by natural means in some medium. The mediums found 
with fossils are sedimentary rocks, amber, asphalt, volcanic ash, ice, peat bogs, sand 
and mud.  
This discovery work was laid to foundation by Louis and Mary Leakey’s pioneering 
efforts. The pair made several discoveries at Tanzania’s Olduvai Gorge in the 1950s 
and 1960s that inspired other anthropologists to come to East Africa in search of 
human ancestors. These include the 1.8-million-year-old skull of a hominid with a 
flat face, gigantic teeth, a large crest on the top of its head and it was named 
Zinjanthropus boisei, then the second to be discovered in this area was the Homo 
habilis (meaning Handy Man). The third fossil discovered was the Homo erectus, and 

 
 
lastly the Australopithecus afarensis which was discovered later in the 1970s, after 
Louis died. 
2.4 
Effects of the evolution theories 
Evolution theory has led to the confinement of science into the framework of a 
naturalistic worldview. It has led to a forced alignment of origins research to the 
dogma of evolution. Before evolution theory, science had commonly been considered 
the study of God’s created universe and the natural laws that he had put in place to 
govern the workings of it. After Evolution, the belief that the universe can be 
explained without the existence of God or any other supernatural phenomenon, 
became far more prevalent, and even gradually became recognized as the worldview 
that all science was practically required to be performed within. Furthermore, 
research done to disprove and criticize evolution is termed as pseudoscience or fake 
science. In addition, the science acclaimed by evolutionists as true science is aligned 
to a huge confirmation bias where evidence for evolution is readily believed while 
evidence against it is explained away or dismissed outright and decried as false. 
The theory of evolution goes against religious teachings that God made earth and 
created all living things. It is against Christians who believe that God had created 

 
 
humans in his own image, and that humans are superior to all other creatures and 
have a soul that is immortal. Moreover, “the theory of evolution challenges the idea 
that God is the designer of the universe and that the beauty, order and complexity of 
the universe is not God’s work”.10 These theories oppose the Biblical facts that say 
humans were created on the sixth day of creation, not over a period of millions of 
years. 
Accordingly, Christians who embrace theistic evolution, in addition to being at odds 
with the biblical account of creation, they place themselves outside of the historical 
position of the church. While believing that God created matter, they fall short of 
affirming that God created not only non-living matter but all visible things (for 
example, oak trees and horses) and invisible things (for example, the angels). “God’s 
creation, therefore, was not a creation of generic material but of specific kinds and 
varieties of creatures”11

Evolution theory gives scientific justification to the view that people of African and 
Aboriginal descent are inferior, that’s the reason for them to be referred to as less 
evolved and for them to be treated with condescension and dehumanizing hatred. In 
support of this Stephen says “Biological arguments for racism may have been common 
before 1859, but they increased by orders of magnitude following the acceptance of 
evolutionary theory.”12 This theory has managed to provide justification for the social 
evils of racism, sexism, and genocide. Although some deceive themselves by denying 
evolution’s link to social evils, the facts are clear that acceptance of evolution has 
played a part in numerous crimes against humanity. Evolution fuelled racism against 
Africans. Evolution led museums to display the bodies of Australian aboriginals as 
examples of missing links between apes and humans. In these ways and more, 
evolution has led to the deaths of millions not only physically but also spiritually. 
This leads directly the very vital point, the spiritual life. In addition to the scientific 
problems and social evils caused by the acceptance of evolution, a spiritual danger is 
also emerging, the rise of atheism. Although some vehemently deny that evolution 
leads to Atheism, no one can argue against the fact that the number of adherents to 
 
12 
_ Stephen Jay Gould, ‘Ontogeny and Phylogeny, Cambridge, Mass’, Harvard University 
Press, 1977 pg. 79. 

 
 
the atheistic belief system has drastically increased since the 1800's, right along with 
the increase of the acceptance of evolution. As stated by National Geographic, in the 
105 years between 1900 and 2005, the percentage of the non-religious world 
population rose from approximately 2% to around 14%, an enormous increase. It can 
also be observed that countries with high acceptance rates of evolution are also 
highly atheistic, for instance France, where 80% of the population confidently accepts 
evolution, is also over 55% atheistic. 13 With evolution concept some people have 
already dismissed the fact that God exists. An example of this are the words of Josef 
Stalin who said “God’s not unjust, he doesn’t actually exist. We’ve been deceived. If 
God existed, he’d have made the world more just.”14 
Evolution has led to the deification of science in the minds of the people, and 
encourages them to place their trust in this new god. Even as many trumpet the 
supposed compatibility of Christianity and evolution, they are oblivious to the 
scriptural foundations of Christianity crumbling beneath their feet. As acceptance of

debate.org/the-implications-of-evolution. 

 
 
evolution has increased, rejection of God has also increased and will continue to do 
so. In spite evolution’s claim to be enlightening knowledge, it has caused many to be 
lost in the darkness of atheism. However, as thousands wander off into this darkness, 
all is not lost, for “there is a light that shines in the darkness, and the darkness has 
not overcome it.” 
2.5 
Roles of the church in mitigating effects of the scientific theories of 
creation 
First and foremost, the church is supposed to teach, emphasizing on how the creation 
account of Genesis is quite unique in ancient literature. This great uniqueness has 
been commented on by Francis A. Schaeffer who says that it “reflects an advanced 
monotheistic viewpoint and it provides us with a sequence of phrases which modern 
science cannot improve upon.” 15 Bringing into light the mentality of the whole 
scripture, which affirms that the creation theory is historical true as the history of 
the Jews and our own present moment of time. This is due to the fact that “both the 
Old and the New Testaments deliberately root themselves back into the early 
 
15 
_ Francis A. Schaeffer, Genesis in Space and Time (Great Britain: Hodder and Stoughton, 
1973) pg. 567. 

 
 
chapters of Genesis insisting that they are a record of historical events.”16 Remind 
Christians that we have the Bible, which is the Word of God, the words of the 
Creator who has always been there and has revealed to us the major past events that 
we need to know. On the basis of these events (creation, the Fall, the Flood, Babel, 
etc.), that we have a set of presuppositions to build a way of thinking which enables 
us to interpret the facts of the present. 
Secondly, the church is to refute these theories in all ways possible because failure 
to this is creating a generation that won’t believe the death of Jesus Christ on the 
cross. The church is to point out the fact that, for Jesus to die on the cross there 
must be a reason and the reason was that man sinned. That one should be aware that 
the one who sinned was the created one and not the one who evolved from an Ape-
like man. If the Genesis account of man’s origin and fall is viewed as mythical, then 
mankind obviously cannot be viewed as fallen and in need of salvation. The point of 
view is that Jesus wouldn’t die if Adam wouldn’t have sinned and also Adam 
wouldn’t sin if he wouldn’t have broken the Laws that were set forth by His creator.   
 
16 
_ E. E. Flack W. F, Albright, Old Testament Commentary (Philadelphia: Muhlenberg, 
1948) pg. 138. 

 
 
Thirdly, is the church coming out and encouraging all those that are fighting 
evolution, those whose hearts have fainted, those who see that the war against 
evolution is done and evolution has won, that though evolution attempts to set up 
naturalistic science as the source ultimate truth, Jesus Christ is the Truth. Though 
social evils caused by evolution bring death, Jesus Christ is the Lord of Life. Though 
evolution brings spiritual darkness, Jesus Christ is the light of the world, the light that 
no darkness–even the darkness brought about by evolution–can overcome. 
2.6   New knowledge created by the study (Gaps to be Bridged) 
As discussed, the dark side of Darwinism is far darker than today’s society would 
have you believe. Scientifically, the theory of evolution is treated more and more 
like an undeniable fact and factions within the scientific community that reject 
evolutionary dogma are themselves marginalized and rejected. Furthermore, it has 
provided justification for the social evils of racism, sexism, and genocide. 
On the other side the church has a vital role in opening up the eyes of the people in 
the society on the dangers of carrying the scientific theories of creation to be the 
definition of their existence. The church also has to be aware on the increase in 
number of atheists in the society. There is still room for the church pointing to 

 
 
people that the scientific theories are not the ultimate truth as far as explaining 
creation is concerned. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
CHAPTER THREE:  
3.0 
RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 
3.1 
Introduction. 
Having looked at the literature review in Chapter 2, this chapter represents the 
methodological approaches that were used to collect data to study the research 
problem. These include the research design, population of the study, sampling 
techniques, sample size, procedures for data collection, sources of data, research 
instruments and the validation of the research instruments.  
3.2 
Research plan (research design). 
Research design is an arrangement of collecting and analysing data in relevance to 
research economy in procedure.  With an intention of facilitation, the smooth running 
of research operations and make research effective with required information as a 
subsided expenditure The researcher used a qualitative and quantitative research 
approach and the deductive research approach.  The qualitative strategy of inquiry 
used in this study was in form of interviews and discussions favorably for the 
uneducated persons, and the quantitative strategy used was the kind of questionnaire 
distributed to some groups of people who were able to read and write among the 

 
 
church leaders.  The qualitative approach had great success because it was seen to be 
the best in discovering why things are the way they are.  This was done through 
intensive and extensive interviews and discussions.  An extensive collection of data 
was done appropriately.  Deductive approach which enabled the research to move 
from general ideas or theories to specific particular and situations. 
3.3    Population, Sampling methods/techniques and Sample Size 
The research was carried out in the Anglican Church of Tanzania Diocese of Victoria 
Nyanza, Mwanza Archdeaconry. The Archdeaconry covers three administrative 
districts of Nyamagana, Ilemela, and Ukerewe which also serve as the archdeaconry’s 
deaneries. 
Samples were selected using the one sampling technique of purposive technique 
which reflects a group of sampling techniques that rely on the judgment of the 
researcher when it comes to selecting the units. So, the researcher approached 1 
Bishop, 7 priests, 5 evangelists, 10 Anglican congregants, 1 regional education officer, 
1 district educational officer, 2 Christian education coordinators, 10 students, 2 
primary school Teachers, 2 secondary school teachers, 2 university lecturers and 3 
Village leaders, which makes a total of 46 people. After collecting data and 
information, everything was filled and kept well in order to come up with a good 

 
 
report after the process of research. On the sample size, since that total number of 
populations in the area covered by the Archdeaconry of Mwanza is large, then the 
researcher selected and interviewed 46 people.  
3.4 
Sources of data information (Primary and Secondary) 
The researcher used both primary and secondary information in carrying out the 
study. Concerning the primary sources, data was collected through direct contact 
with the respondents, personal interviews and through questionnaires. The secondary 
sources were obtained through the already available data collected and analysed by 
other researchers. The researcher used published data available in books, journals, 
newspapers and reports about the topic of the study. 
3.5 
Research instruments 
The research employed instruments like interviews, questionnaire, observation, 
checklist, notebooks, papers and pens. The researcher selected some people and gave 
them printed questionnaires which were returned after one week. The researcher 
scheduled for specific groups and individual interviews. The researcher used a 
checklist to make sure that the planned activities were carried out in time and 
effectively. Oral interviews were conducted to respondents especially to those who 

 
 
found it difficult to communicate through written words or were unable to write and 
read. 
3.6 
Validation of the research instruments 
The research techniques were valid to the researcher because they led the researcher 
to obtain credible, correct and relevant information pertaining.  
Qualitative approach was valid to the study due to the fact that it played a very good 
role in obtaining precise information like feelings, opinions, and descriptions on the 
effects of the scientific theories of creation. 
Quantitative approach was helpful in correcting numerical information appropriate to 
the study because it focuses in analysing figures related to the effects of the 
scientific theories of creation in the society. 
Deductive approach was helpful because it facilitated the research to move from 
general ideas or theories to specific particular and situations which were very crucial 
to the research. 

 
 
3.7 
Data collection procedure. 
 The researcher got permission letters for conducting research from relevant 
authorities beginning with Uganda Christian University and then from the Diocese of 
Victoria Nyanza (ACT). The letters helped the researcher to carry out his research 
without hesitation and was able to make appointments with different offices, schools, 
parishes, congregations and individuals. Not only that but also the researcher 
developed a self-administered questionnaire to help him collect data.  
3.8 
Data processing and analysis. 
The researcher analyzed the data in a statistical technique. The researcher also 
employed analytical techniques in organizing collected information. The researcher 
keenly cross checked relevant and appropriate form, data, edited and modified them 
into relation to the study.  
The researcher made sure that all information received or given by the respondents 
was confidential. This means that the information was not given or published thus, 
only for the purpose of helping the society be aware of the effects of the scientific 
theories of creation and the stand of the church in playing its role. 

 
 
 
CHAPTER FOUR 
4.0 
INTERPRETATION 
4.1 
Chapter’s introduction  
In approach to this chapter that will have more dealing with the scientific theories of 
creation basically at the archdeaconry level, which is Mwanza archdeaconry. 
Presenting how these theories are understood, the peoples’ take and response on 
these theories being taught at school, why the government has allowed these theories 
to be included in the academic curriculum of schools in Tanzania, their effects, how 
the affected should be helped, the church’s failure and roles in overcoming the 
already uprising problem in the community and lastly will come the conclusion. 
4.2 
How scientific theories of creation are understood by both Christians and 
non-Christians in Mwanza archdeaconry. 
Since Christians live in community where there is a wide spread of the scientific 
theories of creation then in one way or the other, they have their own approach to 
this, how they understand, interpret and respond to these theories. Here we are not 

 
 
only referring to Christians but also to all people found in community including 
Muslims and those who believe in African Tradition Religions (ATR) 
Turning to the genuinity of the scientific theories of creation, it was recorded that 
65% of the people interviewed were totally against the scientific accounts of creation 
saying that it is totally a heresy. We have a large percentage in this group and this is 
because it is in this group where we find Christians who believe in the biblical account 
of creation, while other Religion groups like Muslims believe that Allah (God) created 
the universe. One of the things that was not expected is finding a large percent of the 
African Tradition Religion believers acknowledging God as the creator. Shilankuta 
Mwana Butoli an elder and head of the Butolishengwa clan in Ukerewe said “it’s true 
that we neither believe in the Christian faith nor the Islamic faith. Our faith agrees 
and acknowledges God as the creator of each and everything we see and he entrusted 
it to our ancestors to control and keep it. I’m wondering if the scientists think that 
God is not the creator, while at the same time science is just an idea and has no even 
a single element of truth in it.”17

The study recorded a 25% of people who were neutral and argued that science has 
some elements of truth and can be believed since it has some evidences. One of these 
people is Johannes Joktan who said “although I’m a Christian one half of mine 
believes science to be stating the truth because of the evidences they have. You know 
what; you can’t ignore things like the remains in old-vai saying that it is a lie.”18 It 
was recorded that a 10% of the people interviewed had a strong belief in science to an 
extent of saying that God does not exist because He can’t be seen and proved by 
scientific procedures

On the people interviewed it was clear that 70% priests are ignorant as far as 
scientific theories of creation are concerned and 30% had an understanding on the 
theories.  Furthermore 45% of the of the parents interviewed had a clue and 55% had 
no clue of what scientific theories are. 

 
 
 
4.3  
Individual responses as far as teaching scientific theories of creation in 
school is concerned. 
The curriculum that is used to teach in schools, colleges and universities have the 
scientific theories of creation in them; some in form of topics and some as sub-topics. 
These topics are commonly found in history subjects  
Mr. John Leonard the region coordinator in responding to why these scientific theories 
of creation are taught in schools he said “It is important that young people learn 
about the world around them, and are aware of different beliefs”19 To Wilson Fumbi 
an evangelist from St. Peter Nyegezi Parish said “The theory of evolution has nothing

to do with divine revelation but is built on facts. Intelligent design, presented in a 
more suitable way, seeks to portray its approach as scientific, and therein lies the 
danger.”20 
Rev. Samwel Shiyengo a priest from Nyakato parish said there was “a real risk of a 
serious confusion" being introduced into children's minds between belief and 
science.”21 To Rt. Rev Zephania Ntunza the bishop of  Victoria Nyanza diocese when 
asked on his point of view as far as teaching Scientific theories of creation in schools 
and universities is concerned he asid “It is not a matter of opposing belief and 
science, but it is necessary to prevent science from opposing the Christian faith.”22 
And so, there was a mixed feeling between the people interviewed some supporting 
the idea of scientific theories of creation being taught at school while some where 
against this idea.

According to this survey, 76% of the participants agreed with the sentiment ‘Science 
and religion disagree on so many things that you cannot believe both’; 8% of the 
participants agreed that ‘Religious ideas about how the universe began have been 
proved wrong by science’; and 16% of the participants agreed that ‘A good scientist 
cannot believe that life was created by God or a higher being’.  
 
4.4 Effects of the scientific theories of creation 
Suggested by Scholastica Richard one of the students who were interviewed at Ilemela 
primary school, said, “If you are not spiritually mature then you may end-up falling 

 
 
down in faith”23. One of the victims of these teachings is Madam Leah a history 
teacher at Nundu secondary school who graduated at St. Augustine University, she 
said “it was in the lesson of Science of religions that the lecturer taught about the 
accounts of creation; it’s here that a large percent of the students in the class were 
confused. It was only that I grew in a Christian home that’s why I keep my faith in 
Jesus, however unfortunately there are some of my colleagues who until they 
graduated, they insisted that Christianity is a false religion, and what is written in the 
bible is false.”24 
Increase in number of the atheists, is another rising problem that is currently 
facing Mwanza, this has been recorded on different social media pages including 
Facebook and twitter.25    The number of people declaring that God does not exist

is increasing day by day.26 Although this has not been taken seriously, the issue here 
is that most of the people in our societies have un-answered questions and one of this 
is what was the beginning alike, where did God come from, is science stating the 
truth about the beginning? Considering that in Tanzania there are historic sites that 
show how man evolved from the ape like creatures then “I am likely to believe that 
the bible is not stating the truth because the Garden of Eden is nowhere to be found 
though the remains and evidences of evolution still exist and I have personally visited 
the Old Vai Gorge and the National museum so they is no way I can be convinced that 
evolution is a lie and the creation account of the bible is true”27 said Mukuta Kaphili 
When the interviewed were asked if the spread of scientific theories of creation have 
contributed to increase in number of the atheists, there was a mixed feeling on the 
responses; 60 percent of the interviewed said that these theories have contributed 
greatly to the increase in number of atheists, while 10 percent said no and 30 percent 
said that they were not sure.

Positive effects 
The research conducted in Mwanza Archdeaconry concerning the effects of the 
scientific theories of creation realized that there are some positives that people have 
observed, seen and experienced from coming into contact with these theories. This is 
because through these they understand that God created the universe and everything 
that is in it. Also, it is through this they have the courage to face their studies no 
matter what is taught that is against God, they just take scientific studies on creation 
for granted since they know that the syllabus, they are taught is just the idea of 
people who sat and wrote it. Rev Shedrack Bitaly said “it is through studying science 
that people get employed”28 moreover most of the people said that it is through 
studying science they have been employed, an example of this is Mr. Kasumbi a 
Primary School teacher at Ibeshi primary school, Mr. Katto a Secondary School teacher 
at Alliance High School and Prof. Frank Chiteji a lecturer at BUHASI university. To 
Prof. Frank Chiteji he observes studying science as an advantage saying “when you 
know science and understand it, then you know its weaknesses and in return this is a

weapon. When you have it in class then students who are curious to know what 
account states the truth will definitely get the right answer”29 
4.5 The church’s failures 
Teaching Christian education in secondary and primary schools; Only 35% of the 
Anglican priests in DVN Mwanza archdeaconry teach or attend schools for Christian 
education classes. Furthermore, the failure of the Diocese in preparing such programs 
and well-equipped personnel to take part and run the Christian education programs. 
This must be taken seriously and this is a challenge that DVN is facing due to the fact 
that things are getting even shoddier as days go on. I’m saying this because of the 
evangelism coordinators’ statement that “neither is Christian education provided in 
schools nor do the pastors take part in religious groups in schools like UKWATA, 
besides even the bible knowledge exams are not effectively done because of the lack 
well trained and equipped pastors to teach Christian education”30

Surprisingly when Rev Joseph tried to teach Christian education unexpectedly, some 
people sprung and opposed him; he says, “When I started this program the church 
elders and some pastors said that is not my duty but that task belongs to the AIC, and 
they insisted that if I continue I will be neglected by the church”31.   
The lack of use of modern communication ways; When talking about the use of 
means of communication I deliberately mean the social networks and Medias such as 
television and radio sessions, magazines, newspapers and articles. This research paper 
has found out that DVN doesn’t use means of communication, “We don’t have such 
sessions running mainly due to the reason that we don’t get enough time to come 
together and arrange such programs because of the conflicts taking place in the 
Diocese”32 said Rev Can. Kashimba a Vicar General in DVN. 
Organizing seminars on such topics like creation; One of the most forgotten topics 
in the church is the creation, and even if taught it’s just partially. Another reason
