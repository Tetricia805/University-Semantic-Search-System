Policy statements by the United Nations, the African Union and most African countries boldly pronounce on the anticipated
beneﬁts of the internetworked world and associated ICT to society in general and to the world of business speciﬁcally. In
terms of the latter, Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are recognized as being critical to the growth of developing
economies. There is consensus that this sector has considerable potential for improved business outcomes through the
harnessing of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). However, a problem of low adoption of ICT in this
sector still prevails in Africa and there is a gap in our understanding of the reasons for this. In light of this problem, this
paper reports on a survey of Ugandan SME owners in which their ICT pre-usage beliefs and attitudes are explored. The
study identiﬁed four pre-use factors that are correlated with ICT use. The pre-usage beliefs which signiﬁcantly inﬂuence
decisions to adopt and use ICT include Beneﬁt expectation, ICT learnability, User-conﬁdence, and User-friendliness.
These are found to be key determinants of ICT adoption. ICT support and ease-of-use on the other hand were factors
that did not correlate with decisions to use ICT. However, it is found that there is a low predictive capability (17.7%) of
pre-usage beliefs and attitudes in respect of prior use or non-use of ICT among SMEs. As such, this study found that
other contextual factors constitute a greater (82.3%) predictive percentage. In light of this, the paper concludes by
recommending an ICT participatory design process to mitigate ICT pre-use scepticism among SMEs owners.
Key words: ICT adoption, antecedents, scepticism, technophobia, ICT pre-usage beliefs and attitudes
Introduction
The role of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in
shaping the World’s economy is very fundamental and
well documented (Ndiaye et al. 2018). For instance,
amongst OECD countries, SMEs are the predominant
form of enterprise, accounting for approximately 99% of
all ﬁrms (ILO 2012; OECD 2017). They provide the
main source of employment, accounting for about 70%
of jobs on average, are major contributors to value cre-
ation, generating between 50% and 60% of value added
on average, and comprise 45% of total employment and
33% of GDP (IFC 2010; Perkins 2019). Micro-enterprises
alone are reported to employ an estimated 80% of the
working population of Sub-Saharan Africa (Biekpe
2004; Stein, Ardic, and Hommes 2013; Abisuga-Oye-
kunle, Patra, and Muchie 2020).
The increasing penetration of the internet and associ-
ated ICTs in Africa has led several commentators to
argue
that
these
technologies
are
creating
a
new
economy –an information economy –in which information
is the critical resource and basis for competition in all
sectors including SMEs (Pather and Abiodun 2017).
However, it has been observed that users in the SME
sector have perceived the adoption of ICT with ‘scepti-
cism,’ with some scholars ascribing the phenomena to
‘technophobia’ (Gilbert, Lee-Kelley, and Barton 2003;
Gray 2006; Ion and Andreea 2008; Labrianidis 2017;
Rahman et al. 2017; Lew et al. 2019; Panas, Vasiliadou,
and Halkiopoulos 2020). This is especially true amongst
the smallest category of SME business, commonly
known
as
micro-enterprises
(Cataldo,
Pino,
and
McQueen 2020). It has further been observed that such
technophobia in relation to ICT use is inﬂuenced by
users’ pre-usage beliefs and attitudes (Chakraborty and
Al Rashdi 2018).
In light of the prevailing technophobia, this paper
examines the underlying beliefs and attitudes among
SMEs owners in Uganda, which to date comprise low
adopters. The underlying objective of the paper is ﬁrstly
to deepen our understanding of the root causes of ‘scepti-
cism’ of ICTs amongst SME owners in a typical develop-
ing country context. Secondly, the paper assesses the
inﬂuence of SME owners’ demographic variables on
SME owners’ perceptions of ICT and examines how the
demographic variables and perceptions inﬂuence use or
non-use of ICTs. Finally, the ﬁndings are used as a basis
to recommend a participatory design approach as a
means of mitigating technophobia that prevails amongst
SME owners.
Literature review
Level of ICT adoption among SMEs
In this study, the term ICTs refers to the use of internet
enabled applications via desktop or mobile computing
devices to boost business performance (Francis and
Willard 2016). Information and communication technol-
ogies (ICTs), particularly the use of internet to conduct
online business, have been changing the conventional
way of doing business among brick and mortar companies
(Beynon-Davies 2018). In the SME sector several propo-
nents suggest there is need for early adoption if business
sustainability is to be achieved (Beynon-Davies 2018).
The problem of low adoption of ICT amongst this
sector is well documented in the literature (e.g. Nguyen
2009; Mramba et al. 2016; Pather and Abiodun 2017).
This problem is further compounded in practice wherein
SMEs fail to make the connection between ICT adoption
and their proﬁt-motive on the one hand and their personal
motive gain expectations on the other. However, there is a
widely accepted consensus that if SMEs harness ICTs, it is

likely to improve performance, growth and sustainability
for more inclusive employment, increased mobility,
ability to organize customer information and improved
inter-connectedness to other microenterprises (Francis
and Willard 2016). It is further observed that the low adop-
tion and use of ICTs among SMEs in developing contexts
is due to demographic antecedents and beliefs and atti-
tudes of users in the sector (Pustovrh et al. 2017).
Technology acceptance model (TAM)
Over several years various models and theorizes have been
developed to explain the vexing problem of ICT adoption.
In this section we brieﬂy assess one of the seminal adop-
tion theories with a view to examine the usage and non-
usage contexts of ICT among SMEs in a developing
country context.
From an adoption perspective, a widely used theory is
the Technology Acceptance Model (Davis 1985, 1993). In
the original model Davis (1985), posits that a potential
user’s overall attitude towards using a given system is
assumed to be a major determinant of whether one will
or will not use it. Attitude towards use is a cognitive
issue for which Davis (ibid.) highlights two dimensions,
viz., perceived usefulness and perceived ease-of-use.
Moreover, a cognitive response results into affective
response (attitude towards using) which later predicts
actual use (Davis 1985, 1993). However, inherent in
ease-of-use and usefulness is the concept of perception
which is behavioural and attitudinal in nature (Kyakulum-
bye, Muhenda, and Anaclet 2012; Verma and Sinha 2018;
Scherer, Siddiq, and Tondeur 2019). Over the years there
have been several studies that render the original TAM
variables insigniﬁcant. For instance, Sin Tan et al.
(2009) found that relative advantage, compatibility, com-
plexity, observability, and security are signiﬁcant factors
inﬂuencing internet-based ICT adoption. Other studies
have correlated adoption and diffusion challenges among
SMEs to ICT design issues (Aleke, Ojiako, and Wain-
wright 2011). Namankani (2019) has argued that to
ensure successful diffusion of innovation, a balance
must be maintained between the amount of effort
expended in the design of ICT and social factors such as
language and traditional life.
Given the foregoing, and taking into account the low
explanatory prediction by the originator of TAM that
‘Only 36% of variance in the adoption of ICTs is explained
by TAM constructs, implying that 64% comprises other
cognitive and contextual issues,’ (Davis 1993, 475),
further extensions have been made to the model. One
such extension of TAM, which serves to understand pre-
usage issues, is the two-stage information systems con-
tinuance model (Venkatesh et al. 2011) and Uniﬁed
Theory
of
Use
and
Acceptance
of
Technology
(UTUAT); (Chakraborty and Al Rashdi 2018). The fol-
lowing section deals with one of the pertinent extensions
of pre-usage beliefs and pre-usage attitudes.
Pre-usage beliefs and pre-usage attitudes
Venkatesh et al. (2011), build upon TAM and UTUAT to
take into account the contextual nature of ICT use and
user expectations. They advance two other pre-usage
constructs, viz., pre-usage beliefs and pre-usage attitudes
(Yasmin and Grundmann 2019).
Such extensions to the TAM have improved the expla-
natory power of ICT diffusion in developing contexts
(Chakraborty and Al Rashdi 2018). For example, there
are several versions of the frequently cited uniﬁed theory
of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) (Venka-
tesh, Thong, and Xu 2012) among others used in different
contexts. A literature review of 174 articles based on
UTAUT has revealed, from the weight analysis of inde-
pendent variables that variables such as performance
expectancy and behavioural intention qualiﬁed as the
best predictor category (Williams, Rana, and Dwivedi
2015; Chakraborty and Al Rashdi 2018). This supports
our argument in this paper, that pre-usage attitudes, pre-
usage beliefs and performance related expectations are
important
elements
in
understanding
ICT adoption
amongst SMEs. Such expectations can be in form of tan-
gible or intangible elements (Gomez and Pather 2012;
Jawed and Siddiqui 2019).
Tangible and intangible perceived impacts of ICTs
Pre-usage beliefs and attitudes are comprised of both tan-
gible and intangible elements. Effective ICT diffusion
among SMEs should result in impacts that transcend tan-
gible beneﬁts and impacts (Consoli 2012; Jawed and Sid-
diqui 2019). Various studies which reveal the low levels of
adoption among the SME sector, have endeavoured to
make recommendations in respect of tangible components
of ICT adoption. For instance, Arendt (2008) reveals that
in Malaysia, despite efforts to improve technology
accumulation through education and skills development,
SMEs remain on the wrong side of the digital divide.
Others have argued that further research is necessary in
order to develop a real understanding of the ICT adoption
processes in small ﬁrms (Martin and Matlay 2001;
Hartono and Herman 2019).
Other studies have advocated for increasing awareness
among SMEs on the beneﬁts of ICT adoption. For
example, Almazroa and Gulliver (2018) argue the need
for more ICT training facilities for SMEs, measures to
provide ICT products and services at an affordable cost,
and free professional advice and consulting. Some cri-
tiques
have
referred
to
such
recommendations
as
‘Blanket’
approaches
to
promoting
ICT
adoption
amongst SMEs which regretfully have not made signiﬁ-
cant differences to the sector (Eze et al. 2019; Cataldo,
Pino, and McQueen 2020). Others such as Gomez and
Pather (2012) recommend a fundamental paradigm shift
in understanding how ICT might have development
impacts, by focusing on intangible aspects in relation to
usage outcomes, instead of only tangible ones.
Several scholars conceptualize tangible impacts in a
manner whereby they are viewed as quantiﬁable returns
to the implementation of ICTs in organizations and
among individuals (Jawed and Siddiqui 2019). Other
studies have perceived tangibility and intangibility in
terms of delivering direct and indirect beneﬁts respectively
(Jones 2008; Jawed and Siddiqui 2019).
This study postulates that it is crucial to assess the
anticipated tangible and intangible beneﬁts and impacts

of ICTs to the SMEs sector prior to design and deployment
of technology. Prior to any intervention to address low ICT
adoption, there is a need to understand the underlying per-
ceptual beliefs, attitudes and expectations about ICTs
amongst SME owners. This forms the underlying focus
of this paper.
Model construction
From TAM, UTAUT, and an extension of TAM which
highlights pre-usage beliefs and pre-usage attitudes
which can be predominantly be both tangible and intangi-
ble elements, the following model is developed:
The model posits that demographic characteristics like
age, education level, gender can inﬂuence actual ICT use
among SMEs. Beliefs and attitudes can be either positive
or negative. Furthermore, pre-usage beliefs and attitudes
of ICT could inﬂuence and determine use of ICTs
(Ceresia and Mendola 2019). For instance, when assessing
usage of mobile based payments, Almazroa and Gulliver
(2018) reveal that personal characteristics have a positive
inﬂuence on actual ICT use. Similarly, Alruwaie, El-Had-
dadeh, and Weerakkody (2020) also found that demo-
graphic characteristics are crucial in inﬂuencing citizens’
continuous use of e-government services. Moreover,
such expectation beliefs and attitudes may be likened to
tangible and intangible elements from technology-based
innovations (Jawed and Siddiqui 2019). In terms of nega-
tive and positive beliefs inﬂuencing ICT usage, Gholami
et al. (2013) found a signiﬁcant positive effect. On the
other hand, Verma and Sinha (2018) did not ﬁnd a signiﬁ-
cant inﬂuence of ICT pre-usage attitudes and beliefs on
perceived wellbeing.
Such contradictions in the extant literature were
explored in the research that is reported in this paper. In
particular we explored why in some studies, the inﬂuence
is strongly signiﬁcant while in others, it is not. Conse-
quently, the following objectives formed the focus of the
paper:
(a) To identify the underlying factors that determine the
negative and positive beliefs among SMEs which in
turn inﬂuence ICT use.
(b) To establish the relationship between the identiﬁed
factors and ICT use among SMEs in Uganda.
(c) To assess whether there are any signiﬁcant differences
in ICT use among SMEs in Uganda as inﬂuenced by
the underlying factors.
Methods
The primary aim of the paper was to ascertain the antece-
dents and determinants of ICT usage amongst owners of
Ugandan Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). The
objective was to understand the latter so as to inform
future interventions that may improve adoption levels
amongst SMEs in a resource constrained environment.
The study utilized a quantitative cross section survey to
test the research hypotheses derived from literature and
ICT adoption theoretical underpinnings.
Population and sample size selection
The study sampled SMEs from Mukono Municipality,
Uganda. SMEs in this municipality have characteristics
of both urbanity and rural. A sample target of 385 respon-
dents was set, based on sampling norms of (Krejcie and
Morgan 1970).
Mukono Municipality Register has approximately
20,000 SMEs when stratiﬁed according to type of business
(National Population and Housing Census 2014). To cater
for non-response, we enhanced the sample size by 10%
and a total of 425 participants were considered. The unit
of analysis was SMEs owners (managers) while the type
of business was used for respondent stratiﬁcation. Strati-
ﬁed convenience sampling (Neneh and Van Zyl 2012)
was used to collect the data. Twenty-ﬁve research assist-
ants traversed the Municipal zones to collect the data.
The businesses which were targeted have diverse oper-
ations due to the zones where they belong. Thus, stratify-
ing and zoning them enabled business representation
based on location and nature of business.
Survey method
The survey approach utilized a structured questionnaire
for collecting perception quantitative (negative and posi-
tive pre-usage beliefs and attitudes) data, demographics
data and prior use of ICT based on a dichotomous scale
of YES/NO. The objective of the survey approach was
to obtain a ‘snap-shot’ of the situation amongst SMEs
which in turn would provide a basis for quantiﬁcation of
ICT pre-usage beliefs and attitudes.
Instrument development and analysis processes
The development of the survey tool was informed by the
model (Figure 1). The instrument comprised a section to
collect demographic data, followed by a section which
ascertained use experience, and ﬁnally the core of the
instrument comprised statements regarding pre-usage atti-
tudes as guided by the literature and the model. The con-
structs in the tool comprised cognitive response items.
Therefore, questions in relation to pre-usage beliefs and
pre-usage attitudes provided for an understanding of the
context of ICT use which follows on Venkatesh et al.
(2011). The instrument further provided for an assessment
of such beliefs and attitudes in terms of both tangible and
intangible perceptions of ICT beneﬁts could have inﬂu-
enced prior use or non-use of ICTs.
The items in the instrument included a measure of
negative and positive ICT pre-usage beliefs and attitudes
with a total of 14 items (7 negative and 7 positive pre-
usage expectations). For all constructs, the authors asked
respondents to rate their ICT usage attitudes and beliefs,
using a Likert scale of 1–5 (1=strongly disagree and
5=strongly agree).
Results and discussions
This section reports the demographic antecedents of the
SME owners as they were deemed to be critical for
usage attitudes and beliefs. A total of 425 usable responses
were received. This implies that study had an acceptable
response given that it was over the recommended statisti-
cal threshold of 377 for a population of ≥20,000 (Krejcie
and Morgan 1970, 608) and 392 (Israel 1992) for the same
population at a 5% level of precision.

SME category and demographics of respondents
The Table 2 reveals the SME business type and demo-
graphic data. This provides the basis to examine variations
in beliefs and attitudes among the different SME business
sector types (Table 1).
The results reveal that SMEs in Mukono Municipality
comprise small businesses ranging from those that deal
with health-related products and services, pre-schools, to
artisanal type businesses such as welding. The next table
presents the demographics of the SMEs participants that
responded to the survey in Table 2.
After accounting for missing data, it was excluded from
the analysis. Female respondents represented 43.5%, while
male respondents accounted for 56.5%. This suggests male

dominance in SMEs, and this may hold true since, cultu-
rally in Central Uganda, men are regarded as the breadwin-
ners and must ﬁnd alternative means of survival in the
absence of formal employment (Svensson and Wamala
Larsson 2016). Based on the model guiding the study, the
study hypothesizes that demographics are linked to use or
non-use of ICTs among SME sector owners.
Use of ICTs among SMEs
We assessed the extent of use of ICT by SME owners in
the business itself or for any other purpose.
The data in Table 3 reﬂects the low levels of use of com-
puters amongst SMEs. Of the participants, 68.2% of SME
owners have never used a computer in their business and
76.5% have never used a computer in any other non-
business context. This supports the premise of the paper in
respect of the low levels of ICT diffusion in this sector
that underlying pre-usage beliefs and attitudes regarding
ICT use therefore need further investigation. This result
renders support to the diffusion of innovations as it
afﬁrms that most SMEs constitute late majority and
laggards (Rogers 1971, 2010; Meyoki and Kavindah 2019).
SMEs owners’ pre-usage beliefs and attitudes of ICTs
The
results
from
the
fourteen
items
in
the
pre-
usage questionnaire were sub-divided into negative and
positive beliefs and attitudes which constitute behavioural
expectations from ICTs. The results are presented in
Table 4.
In Table 4, missing data was sifted out and the mean
results provided are for the responses recorded from 380
study participants. The mean results tending towards one
(1) reveal a strong disagreement, whereas those towards
ﬁve (5) reveal a strong agreement. The result indicates
that respondents have positive perceptions about most
constructs. For instance, they strongly disagree that com-
puter use is a waste of time. However, they do not
believe that most people can learn how to use a computer
system, which tallies with their other belief that they are
not conﬁdent using the computer system. To establish
what these factors were, a factor analysis was undertaken.
Factor analysis to examine the pre-usage beliefs and
attitudes of ICTs use among SMEs
To understand the factors that inﬂuence ICTs use among
SMEs in Mukono, Uganda, the items in the tool were sub-
jected to exploratory factor analysis to assess the extent of
their loading. The results are presented in Table 5.
Table 5 depicts the rotated Eigen values. This indicates
that there are six (6) signiﬁcant factors for this study. The
results in Table 5 imply that the fourteen (14) items which
comprised in the instrument are categorized into six (6)

factors. The rotated factor matrix which aids factor
naming is presented in Table 6.
From the above factor loadings and matching, the next
section provides the rationale of naming of the factors
taking into account their context in relation to the reality
of ICT pre-use expectations.
Factors that that are associated with the pre-usage
beliefs and attitudes of ICTs among SMEs owners
Some scholars advocate that the naming of factors is more
of an ‘art’ as there are no rules for naming, except to give
names that best represent the variables within the factors
(Costello and Osborne 2005). Other scholars suggest
that naming can come from the from the investigator’s
prior theoretical understanding of the phenomenon under
study (an a priori approach) as the factors get loaded to
a component (Ryan and Bernard 2003). Following on a
combination of such suggestions, the naming of the
factors was based on the above factor loadings, labelling
used in common practice, the research context and
theoretical lenses that were used in the background to
this
study
and
joint
combined
knowledge
of
the
researchers.
Factor 1: Beneﬁt expectation
The ﬁrst factor has three items which relate to an expec-
tation that using computers can improve business that it
does not constitute a wastage of time, and that traders
would like to use a computer more frequently.
These issues align well with the notion of business
beneﬁt expectations. The other issues seem to relate to
personal beneﬁt expectations from use of computers,
which include the notion that the use of computers
would improve well-being. We therefore cast both these
into beneﬁt expectation. However, we note from the com-
munalities table, that well-being expectations were more
prominent.
Factor 2: ICT learnability
The second set of three items comprising Factor 2, are
related the perceived ability of individuals to learn to use

ICT. These are associated with latent variables in respect
of feeling an aptitude to learn something of value
through ICT use, perceiving computers as not being
complex and the need to use computers frequently.
Factor 3: ICT support
For factor three, we consider two key items since one of
the variables loaded highly on to the ﬁrst factor. These
are: needing support from another person to use a compu-
ter system and not needing somebody technical before use,
thereby implying any peer who can offer support can
enhance usability. These are issues related to anticipated
ICT support as an expectation before use.
Factor 4: Ease-of-use
The fourth factor comprised of latent variables in relation
to the ease of which a trader is able to learn to use compu-
ters, and that during use there is an expectation of incon-
sistencies in the system. These are system design related
issues, and are therefore labelled as Ease-of-use.
Factor 5: User-friendliness
The latent variables associated with this factor appear to be
closely related to Factor 4. These include an expectation of
inconsistencies in the system (which also loaded in Factor
4) and the expectation of computer systems to be well inte-
grated. These appear to be premised on notions of user-
centred design. The researchers labelled this factor user-
friendliness.
Factor 6: User-conﬁdence
Finally, the sixth factor relates to a perception that ICT is
cumbersome to use as revealed with one of the variables
loading highly with 0.86. This is coupled with a percep-
tion of not being easy to use and issues related to lack of
conﬁdence. We label this factor as User-conﬁdence.
Correlation of identiﬁed factors with ICT use
After naming the factors, the underlying constructs that
were inherent in each factor were aggregated into an
average index measure. For ICT use, the averaged
measures ranged from 1 (low or no use), 1.5 (moderate
use) and 2 (high use) of ICTs among the SMEs. The cor-
relation results are shown in Table 7.
The above results show that apart from ICT support
(sig=0.932) and ease-of-use (sig. = 0.169), the other four
factors were signiﬁcantly correlated to the use of ICTs
among SMEs. The correlation results contradict the
TAM model which espouses that ease-of-use is a very
strong positive signiﬁcant predictor of actual use. Based
on the correlation results, we reconﬁgure our model of
ICT use among SMEs as follows (Figure 2).

and ICT use

results to examine the predictive power of the pre-usage
factors to ICT use (Table 8).

From the model summary in Table 8, the results show
that the identiﬁed factors signiﬁcantly predict use of ICTs
among SMEs. However, the coefﬁcient of determination
R-squared is only 13%. This implies that actual use of
ICTs among SME owners studied is explained by only
13% of the six (6) factors. The rest of the usage expec-
tations is explained by 87% of other factors which could
be contextual factors. This implies that other methods
are needed to thoroughly understand SME expectations
of ICTs. We therefore posit that such factors could be
revealed during a participatory design process, which
involves SME users. This is supported by others, such
as Aleke, Ojiako, and Wainwright (2011) who argue that
to ensure successful diffusion of an innovation, a
balance must be maintained between the amount of
effort expended in the design of ICT and that of other
social factors.
Analysis of variance identiﬁed factors and ICT use
among
In this section we probe the identiﬁed factors (pre-usage
beliefs and attitudes) to ascertain whether there are differ-
ences between the two main groups of respondents in the
study, viz., users and non-users of ICT. The results of the
One-way ANOVA are given in Table 9.
From the results, there is a statistically signiﬁcant
difference between the two groups in relation to the fol-
lowing factors: Beneﬁt expectations (One-way ANOVA
(F(2,337) = 13.357,
p = 0.000);
ICT
learnability
(One-way
ANOVA
(F(2,352) = 27.647,
p = 0.000);
Ease-of-use (One-way ANOVA (F(2,332) = 3.393, p =
0.035); and User-friendliness (One-way ANOVA (F
(2,337) = 3.442, p = 0.033). There were no statistically sig-
niﬁcant differences in respect of the factors related to ICT
support and User-conﬁdence. This reveals that SME
owners, in the main, are inﬂuenced by their use experience
in terms of their perceptions of ICTs as there were signiﬁ-
cant differences in respect of four of the six factors. The
data here also indicates, that regardless of ICT use experi-
ence, SME owners have similar perceptions about the
level of support they need, and also in their own level of
conﬁdence to use ICTs.
Towards a participatory design model to mitigate
negative beliefs and attitudes towards ICTs among
SMEs
This study renders support to several other scholars who
recommend that there is need for participatory design
mechanisms in order to inﬂuence user acceptance within
applied contexts (Davis 1993; Aleke, Ojiako, and Wain-
wright 2011; Gumbi and Mnkandla 2015). For instance,
the community informatics literature reveals that with
the design of applications, projects and activities within
a community informatics framework that would be most
supportive of local ‘effective use’ would be ‘participatory
design’ (Gurstein 2003). Participatory design is a well
cited recommended strategy (Porter 1991; Qureshil,
Kamal, and Wolcott 2009; Wyche 2015) and several
fruits have been documented to date in respect of its appli-
cation. It is a methodological approach that recognizes that

ideas develop slowly over time, can help discover con-
founding demi-regularities (Lawson 1997; Lee, Olson,
and Trimi 2012) called contextual factors. It could also
mitigates pre-usage beliefs and attitudinal expectations
and helps to clearly understand generative mechanisms
(Van Aken 2005; Andriessen 2006; Jagosh et al. 2012).
In light of the foregoing we recommend the need to
harness a participatory design paradigm to overcome
negative perceptions of ICTs, and at the same time to
consolidate positive perceptions which prevail. This
would involve, as a ﬁrst step, the development of a fra-
mework that incorporates the pre-usage ﬁndings to foster
an environment for undertaking participatory design of
ICT applications with SMEs. The ultimate goal of under-
taking
participatory
design
when
developing
ICT
artefacts would be to conﬁrm or disconﬁrm SMEs’
pre-usage ICT expectations and to reinforce beneﬁts
and any other determinants for use as presented in the
ﬁgure below (Figure 3).
The results of this study identiﬁed several pre-usage
beliefs and attitudes, viz., Beneﬁt expectations, Learnabil-
ity, ICT support, Ease-of-use, User-friendliness, User-con-
ﬁdence and other contextual and social factors. The green
diamond implies that during an artifact participatory
design process, the expectations can be conﬁrmed or dis-
conﬁrmed through collaborative working. It is anticipated
that the mental convergence of ICT designers and systems
users would lead to improved adoption and better usage
outcomes.
The rationale for participatory design is premised on
an assumption that there is a need for carefully planned
interventions to convince the SME population to infuse
technology in their businesses. The literature indicates
that lived experiences such as ﬁnancial insecurity, social
insecurity, unstable future will lead to scepticism and
phobia of ICT (Gumbi and Mnkandla 2015). Further
there is evidence that according to Rogers’ diffusion of
innovation theory a combination of external and internal

inﬂuences of a system much work in a dialectical manner
in order to inﬂuence the diffusion process (Lundvall 1988;
Zenko and Mulej 2011; Cajaiba-Santana 2014). This study
postulates that to aid effective decision-making of techno-
logical acceptance, co-creation can be of potential value of
creating such social and behavioural change.
Conclusion
This paper, in recognizing the critical role of SMEs in
developing economies, has responded to the problem of
the relatively low levels of uptake of ICTs. This study
builds upon prior ﬁndings in the extant literature, which
have demonstrated the value proposition of ICT to
SMEs in terms of improved business operations and efﬁ-
ciencies. The ﬁndings provide insight into the attitudes
of SME owners towards ICTs. The study has shown that
perceptions of ICTs are both positive and negative.
Further the study identiﬁed four pre-use factors that are
correlated with ICT use. The pre-usage beliefs which sig-
niﬁcantly inﬂuence decisions to adopt and use ICT include
Beneﬁt expectation, ICT learnability, User-conﬁdence,
and User-friendliness. These are found to be key determi-
nants of ICT adoption. ICT support and ease-of-use on the
other hand were factors that did not correlate with
decisions to use ICT.
However, the study also found that other factors such
as social and contextual factors also affect ICT adoption.
As such the study proposes a strategy to mitigate negative
ICT pre-usage beliefs which are responsible for low ICT
adoption in the sector. Our proposed co-design recommen-
dation responds to scholars of similar thought that have
argued that ‘there has been a bias to action, not a bias
to knowledge. We are changing the world without inter-
preting or understanding it,’ (Heeks 2010, 625). Similarly,
Gomez and Pather (2012) seem to wonder whether evalua-
tors and designers of ICT4D ask the right questions. Based
on the ﬁndings of this study, we envisage that participatory
design of ICT applications has the ability to orchestrate
this mutual interpretation, ask the right questions, create
mutual understanding, and ensure improved adoption of
ICTs.
Through a co-design process, we envision that the
negative factors identiﬁed in this study together with
other myths, beliefs, attitudes and expectations shall be
mitigated during the process. Once those issues are dis-
conﬁrmed from a participatory design perspective, we
anticipate user satisfaction, improved post-usage beliefs
and attitudes and hence usability and continuance for
use of designed systems amongst SMEs.
In terms of theoretical implication, this study contrib-
utes to the need to integrate demographic antecedents
when planning ICT applications for the SME sector.
During the design of such systems, there is need to under-
stand the inherent variables that are not observable and
measurable through a participatory design process. Other
theoretical implications of this study relate to developing
further underlying understandings of the principles that
must inform the development of ICT design approaches
that are appropriate for the African continent. This paper
takes a ﬁrst step in this regard.
In terms of policy, we advocate that public-private
partnerships must be fostered to catalyze the endeavour
to produce user centric systems for SMEs. Most govern-
ments in the African continent have SME development
foremost on their development agenda. However, much
more needs to be done to ensure that both emergent and
established SMEs beneﬁt from the digital revolution that
is replete in statements of the African Union and most
African governments. Such work needs to promote tech-
nology diffusion among SMES, and thereby ensure that
they are able to access and successfully use ICTs
towards improved business outcomes. The results of this
study provide a basis to understand low ICT adoption.
As such policy interventions may take these ﬁndings
into account in the development of interventions to
support the SME sector.
Finally, future research should entail action research
that will entail working dialectically with SMEs sector
to disconﬁrm the negative pre-usage beliefs and attitudes
while at the same time consolidating the positive beliefs
towards ICTs. To this end the participatory design model
proposed herein, and which draws primarily upon Kyaku-
lumbye (2020), must be subjected to further testing such
that the African continent begins to understand the
reality of implementing true bottom-up processes to
ensure enhanced technology diffusion into the SME
sector.
