❑In simple terms
❑A Scientific writing is a way of reporting what you 
researched, how you researched it, what you found, and 
why it matters—in a clear, structured, and objective manner.
So What is Scientific writing??
❑A specialized form of writing used to communicate research 
findings, ideas, and knowledge in a clear, precise, and 
objective way. It is the standard style used in research 
papers, theses, dissertations, technical reports, and journal 
articles.

❑Scientific Writing (Formal Style):
❑This experiment investigated the effect of sunlight on plant growth. Two identical 
plants were placed under different conditions: one exposed to direct sunlight and the 
other kept in a shaded environment. After seven days, the plant in sunlight exhibited 
greater height and healthier appearance compared to the shaded plant. These results 
suggest that sunlight promotes faster and healthier plant growth.
Normal Writing (Casual Style)
VS 
Scientific Writing (Formal Style)
❑Normal Writing (Casual Style):
❑I wanted to see if plants grow better in sunlight or in the shade. So, I put 
one plant on the window where the sun hits directly and another plant in 
the corner of the room. After a week, the one in the sun grew taller and 
looked healthier, while the shaded one was weaker.

❑Normal writing → casual, personal ("I wanted to see…"), uses everyday words.
❑Scientific writing → objective, formal, avoids "I" unless necessary, emphasizes 
method and results.
