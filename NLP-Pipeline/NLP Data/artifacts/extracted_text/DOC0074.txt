CHAPTER 0NE 
1.0 INTRODUCTION  
The study looks at how last-mile delivery operations are affected by developing technology. This 
chapter includes the study's background to study, problem statement, research objective, and 
specific goals, research Issues, The study's scope Importance of the research, expected issues, 
their resolution, and the specification of variables in practice. 
1.1BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY 
Technology is a broad concept that deals with use and knowledge of tools and crafts and how its 
use affects the ability to control and adapt to the social and physical environment. (Banta, July 
2009, )  In the context of business, technology encompasses a wide range of tools, software, 
hardware, and systems that streamline operations, enhance communication, and drive innovation. 
In the paper by (Jucha, (2021)) addresses technology developments in the delivery sector with an 
emphasis on effectiveness and client support. Route optimization, real-time tracking, 
autonomous sorting, mobile apps, contactless delivery, drones, autonomous cars, data analytics 
for demand forecasting, and cybersecurity measures are some of the examples of innovations. 
Last mile delivery refers to the final leg of the delivery process, where goods are transported 
from a distribution center or hub to the end consumer's doorstep or desired location. (Puri, 
2022)This stage of delivery has evolved significantly over time. In the past, last mile delivery 
was typically handled by individual couriers or postal workers who would manually deliver 
packages to each customer's address. These couriers would often navigate through busy city 
streets and face challenges such as traffic congestion, limited parking, and difficult-to-reach 
locations. However, with the advancement of technology and the rise of e-commerce, last mile 
delivery has undergone significant changes. 
We explore the historical development of last-mile delivery, tracing its evolution from early 
methods of transportation to the innovative solutions and challenges faced in the contemporary 
era. By examining key milestones, trends, and shifts in priorities within supply chain 
management, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of how last-mile delivery has 

2 
 
evolved over time and its increasing importance in meeting the demands of today's dynamic 
marketplace. 
Logistics, in its essence, is the management of the flow of goods and services from the point of 
origin to the point of consumption. It encompasses various activities such as transportation, 
warehousing, inventory management, packaging, and information management. The significance 
of logistics lies in its role as the backbone of global trade and commerce, facilitating the efficient 
movement of goods across supply chains, ultimately ensuring products reach consumers in a 
timely manner. 
The evolution of technology in the logistics sector has been intertwined with the progression of 
human civilization. Early logistics operations relied heavily on manual labor and basic 
transportation methods, such as carts and pack animals. With the advent of civilization, 
civilizations began developing more sophisticated transportation methods, such as the invention 
of the wheel and the utilization of waterways for trade (mecalux, 2023). 
The industrial revolution marked a significant turning point in logistics technology with the 
invention of the steam engine. Steam-powered locomotives and steamships revolutionized 
transportation, enabling goods to be transported over long distances more quickly and efficiently. 
Additionally, the introduction of the assembly line by Henry Ford in the early 20th century 
streamlined manufacturing processes, leading to increased production and the need for more 
efficient logistics management. (Sharma, 2020) 
The emergence of computer technology in the mid-20th century brought about further 
advancements in logistics. Computerized inventory management systems enabled companies to 
track and manage inventory levels more effectively, reducing waste and improving efficiency in 
supply chain operations (Banta, July 2009, ). 
In the contemporary landscape of logistics technology, digitalization, automation, and data 
analytics play pivotal roles in transforming traditional logistics practices. The integration of 
Internet of Things (IoT) sensors into logistics operations allows for real-time monitoring of 
shipments, enabling companies to track the location, condition, and status of goods throughout 
the supply chain (Mouha, 2021). 

3 
 
Block chain technology has emerged as a game-changer in supply chain transparency, providing 
a secure and transparent way to record and track transactions across multiple parties. By creating 
an immutable ledger of transactions, block chain technology enhances trust and accountability in 
supply chain management (Dutta, 2020). 
Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms have revolutionized logistics with predictive analytics 
capabilities. AI-powered systems analyze vast amounts of data to forecast demand, optimize 
route planning, and anticipate potential disruptions in supply chain operations, enabling 
companies to make data-driven decisions and improve efficiency (Ushakov, 2022). 
Last-mile delivery, the final leg of the delivery process from distribution center to the end 
customer, has become increasingly important in urban logistics and e-commerce fulfillment. 
Advancements in logistics technology have enabled companies to optimize last-mile delivery 
operations through innovative solutions such as route optimization algorithms, real-time tracking 
systems, and customer engagement platforms. 
Companies leverage technology to optimize delivery routes, minimize delivery times, and reduce 
transportation costs in the last mile. Real-time tracking systems provide customers with visibility 
into the status of their deliveries, enhancing transparency and customer satisfaction. 
Additionally, companies utilize customer engagement platforms to communicate with customers, 
provide delivery updates, and gather feedback, further enhancing the overall delivery experience. 
(Jucha, (2021)) 
E-commerce's ascent (1990s–2000s) Last-mile delivery saw a major transformation in the 1990s 
and 2000s with the development of e-commerce. In order to properly fulfill consumer orders, 
online merchants like Amazon invented new logistics methods, which raised demand for 
deliveries that were quicker and more dependable. (Corejova, 2022)The global retail e-
commerce sales have grown from 1.34 trillion in 2014 to 4.28 trillion in 2020. Further growth is 
expected, as experts predict sales of 6.39 trillion by 2024, amounting for almost 22% of total 
retail sales (Cramer-Flood, 2021).

1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM 
The last-mile delivery landscape is considered a rapidly transforming thanks to a surge in 
innovative technologies. While DHL has made significant strides in optimizing logistics and 
efficiency (Moradi, 2023)a closer look reveals an underutilization of these advancements within 
their last-mile operations. This underutilization manifests in the limited adoption of solutions like 
advanced route optimization algorithms, real-time tracking enhancements, and autonomous 
vehicles. As a result, DHL isn't reaping the full benefits of these technologies, hindering their 
ability to achieve peak efficiency, customer satisfaction, and cost-effectiveness. This gap 
becomes even more critical when considering the evolving landscape of customer expectations 
and industry standards. DHL's current approach, while functional, risks falling behind 
competitors who are more aggressively embracing cutting-edge solutions. Additionally, the 
growing demand for faster, transparent, and sustainable deliveries further emphasizes the need 
for DHL to bridge this technological gap (Sorooshian, (2022)). To stay ahead, a comprehensive 
review and strategic integration of advanced technologies are crucial. By aligning their last-mile 
operations with the ever-changing demands of the logistics landscape, DHL can ensure they 
remain competitive and deliver exceptional customer experiences.

1.7 LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY  
It was difficult for the researcher to answer inquiries from respondents when they didn't actually 
know the answers. Giving people more likely scale questions to answer, where they can check 
the options at will and minimal information is required for the open-ended questions, can fix this 
problem. 
Due to the fact that the researcher paid for transportation to and from the company, printing, 
stationery, binding, and other expenses, the researcher was limited by financial limitations. This 
was resolved by asking friends and family for money so she can complete the exercise. 
One potential constraint could be the respondent's unwillingness to provide the researcher with 
the necessary information, as certain information may be confidential and they may choose not 
to share it with the researcher. We'll tried to persuade them that the data is solely intended for 
study and has no other use in order to resolve this.

CHAPTER TWO: Literature Review 
2.0 INTRODUCTION 
According to Ronald and William (2003), technology is a system of both simple and complete, 
electronic, hardware devices and informal communication chains or computer-based information 
systems that use hardware and software, internet, and other telecommunication networks that 
transform data resources into endless data of information products. 
(Casella, 2022)The late 20th and early 21st centuries witnessed the rise of automation and 
information technology in logistics. Automated warehouses, robotic systems, and advanced 
material handling equipment streamlined operations and improved efficiency. Furthermore, the 
advent of computer systems and software facilitated the management of inventory, transportation 
planning, and supply chain coordination,leading to greater visibility and control over logistics 
processes.  
The advent of the internet and e-commerce in the late 20th and early 21st centuries transformed 
last-mile delivery. E-commerce platforms and online marketplaces revolutionized retail, 
allowing consumers to shop for goods online and have them delivered directly to their doorsteps. 
(Peppel M. R., 2022)Last-mile delivery became a critical focus for logistics companies and 
retailers, with a growing emphasis on speed, convenience, and customer experience. 
Advancements in logistics technology, such as route optimization software, real-time tracking 
systems, and alternative delivery solutions (e.g., drones, autonomous vehicles), have further 
transformed last-mile delivery, enabling companies to optimize delivery routes, provide real-time 
tracking and visibility, and offer innovative delivery options to meet the evolving needs of 
customers. Consequently, manufacturing, logistics, and transportation systems are significantly 
impacted by technologies such as cyber-physical systems (CPS) and the Internet of Things (IoT). 
(Kostrzewski, 2022)

2.1 THE EFFECTIVENESS OF TECHNOLOGY TO LAST MILE DELIVERY  
Last-mile delivery, the final step in the logistics chain, plays a crucial role in customer 
satisfaction and business success. With the rise of e-commerce and consumer demand for fast 
and reliable deliveries, the effectiveness of last-mile delivery has become increasingly important. 
Technology has emerged as a powerful tool to optimize last-mile delivery processes, enhancing 
efficiency, accuracy, and customer experience. In this essay, we will explore the effectiveness of 
technology in last-mile delivery through seven key points. 
According to (Koh L. Y., Consumer acceptance of the autonomous robot in last-mile delivery: A 
combined perspective of resource-matching, perceived risk and value theories. Transportation 
Research Part A: Policy and Practice, 2024), One of the primary benefits of technology in last-
mile delivery is automation. Advanced algorithms and machine learning enables companies to 
optimize delivery routes, minimize delivery times, and reduce costs. Automated route planning 
software is able to track traffic patterns, weather conditions, and delivery windows to create the 
most efficient routes for drivers. These companies can achieve higher delivery densities, lower 
fuel consumption, and ultimately, faster deliveries. (Chen, 2021). 
Technology provides real-time tracking and visibility throughout the delivery process, enabling 
both businesses and customers to monitor shipments accurately (Shukla, 2022). GPS tracking 
systems allow customers to track their deliveries in real-time, providing them with updates on 
the status and estimated time of arrival. Similarly, businesses can track their vehicles and 
monitor delivery progress to ensure timely and efficient service. (Kafile, 2023)Real-time 
visibility not only enhances customer satisfaction but also improves operational transparency and 
accountability. According to (Peppel M. S., 2024) delivery management platforms provide 
comprehensive solutions for managing last-mile delivery operations. These platforms integrate 
various functionalities such as order management, route optimization, driver dispatching, and 
customer communication into a single interface. Through centralized platforms, companies can 
streamline their delivery processes, improve coordination between stakeholders, and enhance 
overall efficiency. (Alverhed, 2024) Moreover, these platforms often offer customizable features 
and scalability, allowing businesses to adapt to changing requirements and scale their operations 
as needed. 

9 
 
The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the adoption of contactless delivery solutions, further 
highlighting the importance of technology in last-mile delivery. (Koh L. Y., 2024) Contactless 
delivery options, such as doorstep delivery, self-service lockers, and drone delivery, minimize 
physical contact between drivers and customers, reducing the risk of transmission. Technology 
enables the seamless implementation of these solutions, ensuring safe and hygienic delivery 
experiences for both parties (Bergi, 2021). Contactless delivery not only addresses immediate 
health concerns but also sets a precedent for future delivery standards. Effective last-mile 
delivery relies on collaboration and integration between various stakeholders, including retailers, 
carriers, drivers, and customers. (Judijanto, 2024) Technology facilitates seamless collaboration 
through integration with existing systems and platforms. APIs (Application Programming 
Interfaces) enable different software applications to communicate and share data, allowing for 
the seamless exchange of information between stakeholders. By fostering collaboration and 
integration, technology promotes interoperability, efficiency, and service consistency across the 
delivery ecosystem. (Ko, 2020) 
Technology-driven innovation is essential for the continuous improvement of last-mile delivery 
operations. As consumer preferences and market dynamics evolve, companies must innovate and 
adapt to stay competitive (Krishnan, 2024). Emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, 
robotics, and block chain offer new opportunities to enhance last-mile delivery efficiency and 
customer experience. By investing in research and development, companies can stay ahead of the 
curve, drive innovation in the industry, and deliver value-added services to customers. 
2.2 TECHNOLOGICAL TRENDS IN LAST MILE DELIVERY 
Technological advancements have been reshaping last-mile delivery, optimizing routes, 
enhancing tracking capabilities, and introducing innovative delivery methods. Supply chain 
management has advanced significantly as a result of the convergence of digitalization, 
automation, and data analytics in the modern logistics technology environment. Modern 
advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), block chain technology, Internet of Things (IoT) 
sensors, and AI algorithms are revolutionizing old logistical methods and bringing forth 
increased cost-effectiveness, efficiency, and transparency. 
 

10 
 
Route optimization plays a crucial role in last-mile delivery efficiency. Several studies have 
explored algorithms and models for optimizing delivery routes to minimize costs, reduce 
delivery times, and improve resource utilization. (Jucha, (2021)) 
Literature suggests that heuristic algorithms, metaheuristic algorithms (such as genetic 
algorithms and simulated annealing), and mathematical optimization models (such as integer 
linear programming and vehicle routing problem formulations) are commonly used for route 
optimization in last-mile delivery. 
Research has focused on developing algorithms that consider various constraints and factors, 
including traffic congestion, vehicle capacity, delivery time windows, customer preferences, and 
environmental concerns. 
The Internet of Things (IoT) is basically like a system for connecting computer devices, 
mechanical and digital machines, objects, or individuals provided with a unique system (UIDs) 
and without transfer to transmit data over an ability human-to-human or computer-to-human 
relation. (Laghari, 2021)Sensors embedded in physical objects, allow them to collect and 
transmit data over the internet. The sensors are used to track shipments, monitor environmental 
conditions (such as temperature and humidity), and optimize fleet management. (Kostrzewski, 
2022) Temperature sensors in refrigerated containers ensure that perishable goods remain within 
the required temperature range during transportation, reducing the risk of spoilage. (Mouha, 
2021) GPS trackers enable real-time tracking of shipments, providing visibility into their 
location and estimated arrival time which improves logistics planning and customer service by 
reducing delivery delays. 
Blockchain technology are shared and distributed data structures or ledgers that can securely 
store digital transactions without using a central point of authority. More importantly, block 
chains allow for the automated execution of smart contracts in peer-to-peer (P2P) networks [9] 
(Dutta, 2020). They can alternatively be seen as databases that permit multiple users to make 
changes in the ledger simultaneously, which can result in multiple chain versions. In logistics, 
block chain ensures supply chain transparency, traceability, and security by creating an 
immutable record of every transaction or event such as food companies use block chain to track 
the origin of ingredients and verify their authenticity, enhancing food safety and compliance with 
regulations. Retailers and manufacturers use block chain to trace the movement of products 

11 
 
throughout the supply chain, reducing the risk of counterfeit goods and improving product recall 
processes. (Andoni, 2019) 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) Artificial intelligence (AI) is a broad area of computer science that 
makes machines function like a human brain. It is used to address issues that are difficult to 
clarify using traditional computational techniques. AI was first discovered in 1956 by John 
McCarthy but failed to achieve its objectives. (Abduljabbar, 2019) The algorithms analyze large 
volumes of data to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies, enabling predictive analytics and 
actionable insights. In logistics, AI is used for demand forecasting, route optimization, and 
predictive maintenance.  AI-powered demand forecasting algorithms analyze historical sales 
data, market trends, and external factors (such as weather) to predict future demand with greater 
accuracy. This reduces inventory holding costs and stock outs. AI-driven route optimization 
software optimizes delivery routes based on factors like traffic conditions, vehicle capacity, and 
customer preferences, reducing fuel consumption and transportation costs. (Ushakov, 2022) 
Last-mile delivery holds immense significance in urban logistics and e-commerce fulfillment, as 
it represents the final step in getting goods from a distribution center to the customer's doorstep. 
In urban areas, where population density is high and traffic congestion is common, efficient last-
mile delivery is crucial for timely and cost-effective delivery. Moreover, in the context of e-
commerce, where customers expect fast and convenient delivery options, optimizing the last mile 
is essential for enhancing customer satisfaction and retention. 
In e-commerce fulfillment, last-mile delivery plays a critical role in shaping the customer 
experience and influencing purchasing decisions. Customers expect fast, reliable, and convenient 
delivery options, and the success of e-commerce companies is hinged on their ability to meet 
these expectations. 
 
 
 
 
 

12 
 
2.3 CHALLENGES IN IMPLEMENTING TECHNOLOGY TO LAST-MILE 
DELIVERY 
The exponential growth of e-commerce, particularly evident during the COVID-19 pandemic, 
has intensified the challenges associated with last-mile deliveries. Defined as the final stage of 
the supply chain, last-mile delivery encounters complexities exacerbated by shifts in consumer 
behavior and rapid urbanization. These challenges manifest in congestion, prolonged delivery 
times, and sustainability concerns, as noted by (Alverhed, 2024). 
While implementing technology in last-mile delivery offers numerous advantages, it also 
presents several hurdles that companies must navigate to realize its full potential. Chief among 
these challenges is the significant upfront investment required to adopt and integrate new 
technologies into existing delivery processes. This investment encompasses not only the 
acquisition of hardware like GPS trackers, handheld devices, or delivery drones but also the 
implementation of software solutions such as route optimization algorithms and customer 
tracking systems. (mohammad, 2023) highlights the critical role of these technologies in 
advancing logistics, particularly in urban areas. 
Integrating new technology into the last-mile delivery ecosystem necessitates adjustments to 
established workflows and comprehensive employee training programs. Employees need time to 
familiarize themselves with new tools and systems, which may temporarily disrupt operations 
and productivity. To mitigate these disruptions, companies must invest in thorough training 
programs and provide ongoing support to facilitate smooth adoption. 
Another formidable challenge lies in managing and maintaining the intricate technology 
infrastructure essential for efficient last-mile delivery. This includes ensuring the reliability and 
security of hardware and software systems, promptly addressing technical issues, and staying 
current with software updates. (Merchán, 2021)underscores the importance of regular 
maintenance and monitoring for delivery drones or autonomous vehicles to ensure optimal 
performance and safety. The relentless pace of technological innovation necessitates continuous 
evaluation and upgrading of technology solutions to remain competitive. However, this poses a 
challenge for businesses with limited resources or expertise in emerging technologies. Strategic 
planning and investment are essential for identifying technologies that offer the most significant 
benefits to last-mile delivery operations. 

13 
 
Moreover, the integration of technology introduces new cybersecurity risks that demand vigilant 
mitigation efforts. As delivery operations become increasingly reliant on interconnected devices 
and digital platforms, they become more susceptible to cyber threats such as data breaches or 
ransom ware attacks. Protecting sensitive customer information and ensuring the integrity of 
delivery systems require robust cybersecurity measures. 
Additionally, cultural resistance to change within organizations can impede the successful 
implementation of technology in last-mile delivery. Employees may be hesitant to embrace new 
technologies due to fears of job displacement or uncertainty about the impact on their roles. 
Overcoming this resistance necessitates effective communication, leadership buy-in, and a clear 
articulation of the benefits that technology can bring to both the company and its employees. 
 
 
 
2.4 METRICS AND KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS (KPIs) TO 
MONITOR THE EFFECTIVENESS AND IMPACT OF TECHNOLOGY ON 
DELIVERY EFFICIENCY  
Establishing metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) is pivotal for gauging the 
effectiveness and impact of technology adoption efforts on last-mile delivery efficiency. These 
metrics should provide insights into various aspects of the delivery process and facilitate tracking 
progress towards enhancing efficiency (Alverhed, 2024). Without clear metrics and KPIs, it's 
challenging for companies to assess the impact of technology adoption on last-mile delivery 
efficiency. By establishing relevant metrics, businesses can effectively monitor their progress 
and identify areas for improvement. 
Measuring the variance between estimated and actual delivery times is crucial. This KPI 
evaluates the accuracy of delivery time predictions enabled by technologies like route 
optimization algorithms and real-time tracking systems. Comparing delivery times before and 
after technology implementation allows for an assessment of efficiency improvements, with a 
lower variance indicating enhanced planning and execution in last-mile delivery. Tracking the 

14 
 
variance between estimated and actual delivery times provides tangible evidence of how 
technology adoption impacts delivery accuracy and efficiency. By reducing this variance, 
companies demonstrate improved planning and execution, leading to more reliable delivery 
services (mohammad, 2023). 
Accurate order fulfillment is paramount for customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. 
Technology solutions such as automation in inventory management and order processing enable 
companies to monitor order accuracy. On-time delivery is a critical KPI reflecting delivery 
efficiency, with the percentage of successful first-attempt deliveries serving as a key indicator. A 
higher success rate signifies effective technology utilization in overcoming obstacles and 
ensuring timely deliveries. Accurate order fulfillment is crucial for maintaining customer 
satisfaction and optimizing operational efficiency. By leveraging technology solutions, 
companies can streamline inventory management and order processing, leading to higher rates of 
on-time delivery and improved customer experiences (puri, 2022). 
Cost savings are a significant outcome of technology adoption in delivery processes. Monitoring 
the cost per delivery and cost per mile traveled allows for an assessment of the financial impact 
of technology implementation. Optimizing routes and leveraging technology solutions like GPS 
tracking and route optimization software help reduce delivery costs per mile, enhancing 
efficiency and profitability. Cost savings are a key driver of technology adoption in last-mile 
delivery. By monitoring costs per delivery and per mile, companies can evaluate the financial 
benefits of technology implementation, including reduced fuel consumption and labor costs 
(puri, 2022). 
For transportation and logistics businesses, tracking driver productivity is essential for 
optimizing delivery efficiency. Monitoring the utilization rate of delivery drivers and vehicle 
performance metrics such as fuel efficiency and maintenance costs enables businesses to 
optimize fleet performance and minimize disruptions in last-mile delivery operations. 
Maximizing driver productivity and vehicle performance is essential for achieving efficient last-
mile delivery. By leveraging technology solutions, companies can optimize resource utilization, 
reduce operational costs, and enhance overall delivery efficiency (Merchán, 2021). 
Ultimately, the effectiveness of technology adoption efforts should translate into improved 
customer satisfaction and retention. Gathering feedback from customers regarding their last-mile 

15 
 
delivery experience through surveys, feedback mechanisms, and Net Promoter Score (NPS) 
helps assess whether technology enhancements positively impact the overall delivery experience. 
Positive feedback and high satisfaction scores indicate that technology-enabled last-mile delivery 
processes are meeting or exceeding customer expectations, thus reinforcing the benefits of 
technology adoption in enhancing delivery efficiency. Customer satisfaction is a critical measure 
of the success of technology adoption in last-mile delivery. By collecting feedback and 
monitoring satisfaction metrics, companies can ensure that technology-enabled processes align 
with customer expectations and contribute to long-term customer loyalty and retention (maisano, 
2018).

CHAPTER THREE: Methodology 
3.0 INTRODUCTION 
This chapter mostly addresses the techniques and protocols that were be used by the research to 
get the necessary data. Additionally, this chapter covers the study region, sample design, data 
collecting source, data collection tools, data collection techniques, and tool validation and 
dependability, research variables, data processing, methods for interpretation and analysis, 
ethical considerations, and study limitations. 
This chapter presents the methodology, which should be used in carrying out the study, which 
includes the research design, study population, sample size determination, sample selection, 
sources of data, data collection instruments, validity & reliability and ethical consideration. 
3.1 RESEARCH DESIGN  
This study has employed a descriptive research design in order to collect data required to answer 
the research questions. This  provides the researcher with a clear picture about how IT impact on 
supply chain at DHL The basic reason for using descriptive study design is because not so much 
is known about the situation at hand to comprehend the nature of and describe the characteristics 
of variables of interest in situations thus fit for such kind of study given that little empirical 
research has been carried out on IT According to (McLeod, 2008),a research design is "the 
overall plan or structure of the study that serves as a guide in collecting and analyzing data." 
The study employed a cross-sectional research approach which can allow to study, multiple 
variables at the same time for example age, gender and level of education as well as other 
performance indicators. The study also incorporated both qualitative and quantitative data 
collection methods in order to achieve the desired results. This design facilitated the 
manipulation of study variables to derive insights of the study.  
 
 
 

17 
 
 
 
3.2 AREA OF STUDY   
The study population refers to the specific group of individuals or elements from which data is 
collected and analyzed in a research study. The study will be carried out At Kampala Road, 
Mabirizi Complex Building, First Floor Room 03, and Kampala, Uganda.  
 
3.3 SAMPLE SIZE  
DHL is a wide company in over 200 countries with over 600,000 employees overall. The study 
will focus on the employees in Uganda with the number of respondents where the Sample Size = 
N / (1 + N*e2)   
N= population size 
e= margin of error 
The total population of employees of DHL Kampala road are 30 employees and the researcher 
will purposively select respondents including Managers, Officers and other support staff. The 
research will use a sample size of 30 respondents that will be selected from the population above. 
 
3.4 SAMPLES DESIGN AND PROCEDURE  
Sampling design can be divided into two main categories, probability, and non-probability 
sampling. In probability sampling, every person in the target population (either random or 
representative) has an equal chance of being selected for the sample. (Lanz, 2019) To be more 
precise, the researcher employed purposive sampling along with a nonprobability sampling 
approach. This was because the people that were recognized had an edge over others in light of 
the questions that were posed, and they assisted the researcher in providing the best answers 
possible because the researcher already had some background details on their studies and the 
activities they carry out as part of DHL initiatives. 
 

18 
 
3.4.1PURPOSIVE SAMPLING 
The procurement, production, research and development, and operations department heads will 
be Purposively Sampled for the qualitative data. This approach will be taken since the 
purposively selected individuals are assumed to have vast knowledge of the subject. The 
researcher is eager to learn more from people who are knowledgeable and experienced in last 
mile delivery-related matters. The respondents will be recorded and the data will later be 
transcribed for purposes of the research report.  
3.4.2RANDOM SAMPLING  
These other respondents including all staff will be selected randomly without bias and each will 
have chance is being selected. Aiming to produce a representative sample that accurately reflects 
the characteristics of the population from which it will be drawn. The researcher will use to come 
up the exact number of people to respond to the questionnaire for quantitative data. 
 
3.4.3 SOURCES OF DATA  
Primary and secondary sources has both provide data for the collection. Using specially created 
questionnaires, the primary data will be gathered from the sample population that was 
determined in table I above. The maintained organization's internal records are another source of 
secondary data, such enhanced by information taken from journals, newspapers, websites, books 
on procurement, and other library-accessible sources. 
3.5 DATA COLLECTION INSTRUMENTS  
Data collection instruments are tools used to collect data and record during research. The 
researcher will use a questionnaire guide to collect necessary information for the study. 
Collecting data involves using a certain method of inquiry to establish facts in instances when 
the knowledge that is already accessible is sufficient. There will be in-depth interviews with the 
project officer, field officers, local council representatives, community organizers, and lastly the 
children and teenagers to get the needed data. The rationale for conducting in-depth interviews 
was to facilitate a greater level of engagement between the researcher and the respondents, so 
yielding more information. Data was later transcribed after the interview was recorded. 

19 
 
The researcher obtained a letter of authorization to carry out the study from Uganda Christian 
University's Research Ethics Committee. The researcher informed DHL that she had been 
assigned to perform a study in their company with an introductory letter from the School of 
Business at Uganda Christian University. These letters were submitted in order to move on with 
and carry out the research. 
 
3.6 QUESTIONNAIRE GUIDE 
Questionnaire involved the researcher formulating a set of questions on the study's subject and 
providing them to participants to complete online, offline, or orally, or digitally. Because this 
approach is user-friendly and reasonably priced, it is convenient for researchers. 
 Both closed-ended and open-ended questionnaires will be used in the study as a fundamental 
method of data collection. Researchers utilize both closed-ended and open-ended questionnaires 
because they provide for easy access to respondents and can span a broad geographic range via 
questionnaires more than with any other technique. 
A questionnaire is a research instrument that consists of a set of questions or other types of 
prompts that aims to collect information from a respondent. A research questionnaire is typically 
a mix of close-ended questions and open-ended questions. (scribbr, 2021 ) 
3.7 DATA ANALYSIS 
Descriptive statistics was used to summarize and modify the data acquired since they guarantee 
correctness, completeness, sufficiency, and reliability and allow the researcher to properly 
characterize measurements using a limited number of indices. 
This happened after data had been collected, the researcher had to analyze data and present it. It 
was done manually. It was done using pie charts, graphs, tables, figures, or diagrams. The data 
was presented according to the study objectives. 
 
 
 

20 
 
3.8 ETHICAL CONSIDERATION 
The management of DHL has given the researcher complete information and authority to 
conduct the study. To allay any suspicions, the researcher will obtain an introduction letter from 
the institution. After that, the researcher will keep choosing respondents, set up times for 
delivering surveys, picking them up, and scheduling interviews. The researcher will guarantee 
the respondents' privacy about the information they submit and promise not to share it with 
outside parties.

CHAPTER FIVE 
SUMMARY OF THE FINDINGS, CONCLUSION AND 
RECOMMENDATIONS 
5.0 Introduction 
 This chapter presents a summary of the study findings, conclusion of the topic, 
recommendations and areas for further research on the effect of the adoption of technology on an 
organization’s last mile delivery 
5.1 SUMMARY OF THE STUDY FINDINGS  
The study was done to analyze the effect of the adoption of emerging technology on last mile 
delivery operations of DHL. The research was guided by three specific objectives that focused 
on certain aspects associated with the use of technology within organizations. These aspects 
included the effectiveness of technology to last mile delivery such as DHL Uganda. Those 
aspects were used while referring to DHL as a case study for the research. The specific 
objectives included I. To examine the effectiveness of technology to last mile delivery, to 
examine create measurements and key performance indicators (KPIs) to track the success of 
technology adoption initiatives and their effects on delivery efficiency and to examine the 
challenges that come with implementing technology in the companies. The study findings with 
regards to those objectives are summarized below; 
 
5.2 THE FINDINGS OF THE CHALLENGES FACED WHILE USING 
TECHNOLOGY ON LAST MILE DELIVERY OPERATIONS DHL. 
 
It was revealed that 65% of the respondents agreed, and 30% strongly agreed that data security 
and privacy is a challenge. This is in agreement with (Tawalbeh, 2020) who exposes the bit that 
complex services require trust and confidence to efficiently get the delivery done with the help of 
technology. 30% of the respondents agreed, 65% strongly agreed while 5% disagreed and 0% 
were not sure of technical issues and downtime being another challenge. (Boggs, 2009) 
emphasizes that technology requires sustained investment and strong alignment with systemic 

32 
 
changes. Failure to deal with technical issues and systems poses a very big gap and challenge 
thus being in agreement with the above scholar. Furthermore, 55% of the respondents agreed that 
using technology raises ethical concerns related to privacy, transparency, and fairness in delivery 
practices with 30% who strongly agreed and 15% disagreed. (Gregory, 2019) kept in mind that 
in the world of business, last mile delivery is the basis for which strategic businesses develop 
associations within their environment and much more so planned for a new competitive edge. 
The fact that not everyone in DHL was adapting to the new trends in competitiveness posed a 
hindrance and highlighted a strong agreement that user adoption and training became a big 
challenge if not planned for adequately. 25 % of the respondents agreed to inadequate knowledge 
or training on operating different technological tools used in deliveries can be a barrier being a 
challenge, 75% strongly agreed, 0% disagreed and 0% were not sure (Harahap, 2019) categorizes 
last mile delivery. All these categories require monetary terms to be effectively and efficiently 
done and adhered to which may either positively or negatively affect the cost and return on 
investments of the business. In agreement with the scholar, it brought about negative impacts for 
instance more costs were incurred in integrating different systems.  
 
5.3 FINDINGS ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF TECHNOLOGY ON 
LASTMILEDELIVERY OPERATIONS AT DHL 
It was revealed that 65% of the respondents agreed to route optimization using alogorithims with 
GPS tracking and real time data can significantly reduce delivery time and 15% strongly agreed 
3% disagreed ad 5% were not sure (Žunic, 2020) In agreement with the above scholar, existence 
of automation proves a relationship between technology and last delivery. 35% of the 
respondents agreed automation and optimizing tools can help reduce labor cost, fuel expenses 
and vehicle wear and tear in last mile delivery, 20% strongly agreed, 45% disagreed and 0% 
were not sure. Technology has contributed and continues to contribute to enhanced performance 
and performance in of last mile delivery (Burke, 2002)In agreement with the scholars cited, 
digital transformation is proof that technology and last mile delivery bear a relation based on the 
outcome which is performance. In addition, 30% of the respondents agreed that technology 
allows customers to track deliveries and offers flexible delivery options, improving their 
experience delivery, 70% strongly agreed, 0% disagreed and 0% were not sure. In agreement

with rapid growth brought by IT transforms generations in the way they do things. This 
generation prefers so much branding, personalization, and customization in which technology 
enables service providers to personalize and customize their offerings according to individual 
customer preferences. Customer or client data and analytics help in understanding customer 
behavior, needs, and preferences. 90% of the respondents agreed to technology adoption has 
potential to reduce the carbon footprint of last mile delivery, 5% strongly agreed, 0% disagreed 
and 0% were not sure. In agreement (MARIKI, 2021) with technology is vital for process. This 
improves environmental support, and ability to improve the environment and enhances 
collaboration between organizations that promotes a green environment leading to better 
delivery.  
5.4 FINDINGS ON THE FACTORS IN MEASURING THE SUCCESS OF 
TECHNOLOGY ADOPTION INITIATIVES LAST MILE DELIVERY AT DHL 
It was revealed that 65% of the respondents found it very important tracking user adoption rate 
by monitoring logins usage frequency and training completion and 25% found it important 5% 
found it somewhat important and 5% not important. In agreement (Froehlich, 2007) with who 
discovered that at mobile phone, has been adopted faster than any other provides rich qualitative 
accounts of device usage and human on user experience, we surveyed users after they completed 
DHL. 65% of the total respondents agreed it very important measure the time and resource saved 
compared to previous methods, 30% found it important, and 5% found it somewhat important.  
In addition, 50% of the respondents agreed conduct feedback sessions to gauge user satisfaction 
with the new technology as a very important measure to competitive advantage being a benefit, 
50%found it important, 0% disagreed and 0% were not sure. In agreement with (Uzir, 2021) 
when technology is used in the last mile delivery of services, it can be very useful to all 
employees at DHL. This gives an upper hand to be ahead of competitors since the employees are 
electronically sensitized and vital information is easily shared with automation in place. 
 Furthermore, 65% of the respondents agreed that evaluating the return on investment of the 
technology adoption initiative by comparing the benefits gained against the costs incurred, 30% 
found it important and 0% found it somewhat important and 5% found it as not important. In 
agreement with (Lucas Jr, 1999) return from specific programs, projects and new initiatives 
standard cost–benefit techniques to assess large investments. Those notes were later compared 

34 
 
and matched against the … This leads to increased goal and target achievement that comes as a 
result of mutual trust, rapport, and understanding among employees. 
 
 
5.5 SUMMARY OF FINDINGS  
The first goal, which looked at the difficulties in adopting technology for last-mile delivery at 
DHL, revealed that most respondents—65% of the total—agreed that there were difficulties in 
utilizing technology to improve last-mile delivery. Of all respondents, 75% strongly agreed and 
15% disagreed with the difficulties encountered when utilizing technology to improve last-mile 
delivery. It may be inferred that a majority of the total respondents were aware of the challenges 
and their consequences, including but not limited to technological problems, insufficient 
expertise, and higher expenses. The survey, which looked at how effective technology is in last-
mile delivery at DHL, revealed that 90% of respondents overall agreed that technology is 
effective in last-mile delivery at DHL, while 5% strongly agreed and were unsure. This 
suggested and demonstrated that the responders had knowledge of the benefits and efficiency of 
last-mile delivery. Enhanced productivity, increased customer happiness, a competitive edge, etc. 
are some of these advantages. The study's goal was to look into the benefits of technology use in 
DHL's service delivery. Out of all the respondents, 77% felt that it was important to track the rate 
at which technology is used when it comes to last-mile delivery at DHL, while 23% disagreed. 
This implies that the participants have a comprehensive comprehension of the standards required 
to evaluate the efficacy of technological adoption programs for last-mile delivery.

5.6 RECOMMENDATIONS 
In light of the study's conclusions, the researcher advised businesses to think about potential 
solutions for problems that could arise from implementing technology and related practices. For 
example, educating staff members on the value and use of IT techniques prior to their adoption 
might help overcome resistance to change. That would allow the businesses to reap the complete 
rewards of implementing technological techniques, such as enhanced performance effectiveness 
and greater stakeholder transparency, among many other advantages.
