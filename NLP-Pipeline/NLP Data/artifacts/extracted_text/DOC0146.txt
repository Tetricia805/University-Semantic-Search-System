ABSTRACT 
Emergency of fungal diseases can be controlled using chorax72% fungicide however, 
there is limited information on its effectiveness under Uganda's unique 
environment. This study evaluated the effectiveness of chorax72% fungicide in 
controlling late blight disease and its effect on yield of tomatoes. The research 
was conducted using a randomized complete block design with three replications. 
The different treatments dosages of Chorax 72% included the recommended 
(37.5g/10L of water), 25% higher (46.9g/10L) and 25% lower (28.1g/10L), a 
reference fungicide (mancozeb at 25g/10L) and untreated control. Data was 
collected on severity, incidence and tomato yield including fruit yield weight and 
marketable fruits.  The results showed that there was significant difference 
(p<0.001) among the dosages of chorax72% on the disease severity and incidence. 
There was also significant effect of Chorax 72% on yield weight (p=0.015) and 
marketable fruits (p=0.012) of tomatoes. The 25% higher dosage of Chorax 72% 
showed the lowest disease severity and incidence (1.54 ± 0.60a and 0.20 ± 0.12a 
respectively) while the untreated control had the highest severity and incidence 
with 2.97 ± 0.74d and 0.91±0.11d respectively. The recommended dosage produced 
the highest fruit weight (2574g) and zero treatment had the lowest fruit weight 
(872g), both the recommended and 25% higher doses resulted in the highest 
number of marketable fruits(33.0fruits) compared to zero treatment (8.0fruits). 
This implies that the recommended (37.5g/10L) and 25% higher dosages 
(46.9g/10l) of Chorax 72% inhibits the pathogen growth on tomatoes leading to 
increased crop yield.  Therefore, the recommended dosage (37.5g/10L) of 
chorax72% fungicide is recommended for controlling late blight disease in tomatoes 
in Uganda.

CHAPTER ONE 
1.0 INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Back ground. 
Tomato (solanum lycopersicum) is one of the most widely cultivated and consumed 
vegetables globally being a staple in many diets dues to its nutritional 
benefits(Ddamulira et al., 2021) its ranked the third vegetable worldwide (Brief, 
2022), Currently the global tomato production is at 186 million tones.).The food 
and agriculture organization (FAO) reported that Uganda’s tomato was estimated 
at over 800,000 metric tons IN 2020 making significant increase from previous 
years.( FAO,2020). 
However, despite of its importance, the tomato production (farmers) in Uganda 
faces serious hindrances/challenges, which are particularly from biotic stress most 
notably the diseases which accounts for a substantial portion of yield losses. 
Among these, late blight caused by the pathogen phytopthora infestans is one of 
the most devastating leading to severe reductions in crop quality and quantity 
(Byarugaba et al., 2018). Late blight not only affects tomatoes but also crops like 
potatoes and its management is pivotal for maintaining productivity. The late 
blight disease has characteristic  symptoms such as water-soaked, gray-green 
circular lesions on leaves, as the disease progress ,the spots darkens and a white 
fungal growth forms underside the leaves eventually colonizing the whole plant 
(Quesada-Ocampo & Meadows, 2019)). This interrupts the plant’s physiological 
processes leading to drying off of leaves, fruits with greasy spots hence the death 
of the whole plant. The   use of a resistant variety is the best option tin the 
management of this disease, despite that the pathogen is more aggressive and 
highly adaptive in the environment, and a breakdown of resistance is reported 

2 
 
making measure to often fall short when faced with significant disease pressure 
(Haverkort et al. 2009). So, the most reliable strategy left is the use of integrated 
disease management (IDM) for the disease, where fungicides stands as the most 
effective  over the disease t(DEY et al., 2024). 
The combination of cymoxanil and mancozeb has gained attention for its 
effectiveness against late blight. Cymoxanil is a systemic fungicide that can 
penetrate the plant leaves rapidly and act by preventing sporulation in fungi 
(Action, n.d) hindering the reproduction of spores from infected plants. While as 
mancozeb is a protectant fungicide that provides abroad spectrum contact action, 
disrupting fungal enzyme functions (Gullino et al., 2010). The dual action of the 
two active ingredients in chorax72% makes it a promising solution for tomato 
farmers in Uganda facing this threat of late blight. Though its effectiveness is not 
known yet. The study therefore assessed the effectiveness of chorax72%   fungicide 
in controlling late blight disease in tomatoes for improved growth and yield.  
1.2 Problem statement. 
Despite the benefits of tomatoes, its production is challenged by the devastating 
pathogen phytophthora infestans (Akello L et al., 2023). The disease is reported to 
cause losses of about 30-70% (Akello L et al., 2023) studies showed a yield loss of 
upto 79.47% in susceptible under the favorable conditions for the pathogen.  
Management of the disease basically relies on synthetic Fungicides that stands out 
to be the effective strategy under intense disease pressure like Dithane 
(mancozeb), bravo (chlorothalinil) and indofil M-45(mancozeb) (Haveri et al., 
2018). The repetitive use of the same type and formulations of the fungicide has 
led to development of resistance in P. infestans diminishing the long-term 
efficiency of these chemicals (Cohen et al., 2020). Studies shows that a 

3 
 
combination of cymoxanil+mancozeb fungicides performs best in disease control 
and also influence the quality of tubers and fruits yield (Debanath S and P.S.Nath 
,209) Kumar P et al.,2018). These exists on the Asian continent (India) where 
climatic conditions differ from Uganda's and this which may alter the genetic 
make-up of the pathogen and support the growth-patterns of crops differently 
hence affecting the response to the fungicide by the plant and the pathogen. 
However, for chorax72% fungicide formulation and field applicability, limited 
information is known on its effectiveness under Uganda's unique environment and 
the farmers behavior of applying without observing the prescribed dosages. 
Therefore, this study evaluated the effectiveness of chorax72%   fungicide in 
controlling late blight disease and its effect on yield of tomatoes.  
1.3 Research Objectives. 
1.3.1 General objective. 
To evaluate the effectiveness of Chorax72%fungicide in controlling the late blight 
in tomatoes for improved tomato yields.  
1.3.2. Specific objectives. 
1. To assess effect of chorax72% fungicide on growth of Phytophthora infestans 
in tomatoes  
2. To determine the effect of altering the fungicide dosages on the yield of 
tomatoes. 
1.4 Hypothesis. 
1. Chorax 72% fungicide has no significant effect on the growth of phytopthora 
infestans in tomatoes. 

4 
 
2. Altering the dosages of chorax72% fungicide will significantly affect the 
yield of tomatoes. 
1.5 Justification of the study. 
Chorax 72%, a fungicide containing 8% cymoxanil and 64% mancozeb has been 
developed as one of the potential materials that can contribute to the 
management of late blight disease that causes devastating losses in the world. 
Based on the studies and applicability of the active ingredients contained in the 
fungicide, they show positive results when used as a single or mixed with other 
fungicides in inhibiting the growth and development of the pathogen p. infestans 
(Ogolla et al., 2021). This combination promises enhanced effectiveness by 
targeting the pathogen at different stages of its life cycle since the active 
ingredients in it have different and unique mode of action towards the pathogen. 
However, for any new chemical introduced in a country its mandatory to go 
through the ministry of agriculture (MAAIF) for approval and registration under the 
Agricultural chemical control, Act 2006. This applies to the fungicide in study 
before its distribution and adoption, its important to assess its efficacy under the 
agro-ecological conditions of Uganda against the strains of the pathogen present. 
The research evaluated the effectiveness of chorax 72% in controlling late blight 
and its impact tomato yield. The study would help the MAAIF stake holders in 
making informed decisions and recommendations of the dosage for farmers 
adoption in managing the late-blight disease. 
1.6 Significance. 
Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) is one of the major horticultural crops grown 
extensively for its nutritious edible fruits  (Akejo & Obbo, 2017).  With over 20,000 

5 
 
small holders farmers particularly for income generation (Sonko et al, 2005), and 
the sector is dominated by male who do it for purposes of house hold income 
generation. (Ddamulira et al., 2021). Since the Late blight, caused by 
Phytophthora infestans, is a devastating disease that can result in significant yield 
losses to tomato growers, and the active ingredients contained in chorax72 % 
fungicide have been effective in controlling the P. infestans pathogen, it’s very 
crucial to evaluate the efficacy of Chorax 72% fungicide compared to the widely-
used Mancozeb under the Uganda agroecological zone. This study lies in its 
potential to enhance agricultural productivity and sustainability by providing 
effective solutions for managing late blight in tomatoes. This will reduce on the 
economic losses, increase the income of the smallholder farmers and their 
livelihoods through the increased productivity. 
1.7. Conceptual frame work. 
This conceptual frame works serves to summarize how the research was done 
bringing out the relationship among the components of my investigations (Anfara 
and Mertz, 2014). The independent variables, the variables that were the major 
key factors of the experiment study being chorax72%fungicide application the 
dosage (the recommended dosage,25% higher and lower than recommended 
dosage) and frequency of application, also the fungicide properties (chemical 
composition, mode of action). 
The dependent variables, the assessment depended on the main dependent 
variables are the disease progress (severity and incidence) after the fungicide 
application and the yield response in different treatments.  
Intervening variables, these are factors that controlled the experiment for 
example, the experiments were also dependent on the environmental factors like 

6 
 
humidity and rainfall patterns affect the pathogen activity and also the susceptible 
tomato variety which prone to the disease.

CHAPTER TWO 
2.0. LITERATURE REVIEW. 
2.1.1. The importance of the Tomato production. 
Tomatoes are a crucial component of global diet, with production levels reaching 
180 million tones per year as of 2019, ranking them as the most important 
vegetable crop (Hong et al., 2022). They are rich in vitamins phytonutrients and 
minerals contributing to public health and nutrition (khanh et al., 2020). The 
economic importance of tomatoes extends beyond their nutritional value, they are 
an essential source of income for millions of farmers and play a key role in national 
income particularly in developing countries (Khanh et al., 2020). 
2.1.2 Late blight. 
Late blight is devastating disease caused by the oomycete pathogen pytophthora 
infestans. This pathogen is notorious for causing the Irish potato famine in 1840s 
that led to death of over million people (Quesada-Ocampo & Meadows, 2019) .it 
affects tomatoes and other members of the solanaceae family such as potatoes, 
petunias and nigh shade. With several symptoms on the tomato plant ; irregular 
water soaked lesions on leaves, often with a lighter halo around them, white 
cottony growth on the underside of leaves where sporangia forms, brown to gray 
lesions on the surface of leaves, blighted leaves and stems that curl, shrive and 
eventually die and rotted fruit with greasy spots that become leathery and 
chocolate brown ((Nelson, 2008) 
2.1.3. Origin and distribution of P. infestans 
Phytophthora infestans originated in America and has since spread globally (fry et 
al., 2016). As a hemibiotrophic pathogen, it takes nutrients from living tissues and 
transitions to necrotic phase, decaying its host tissues during infection (Zhang et 

8 
 
al.,2014). The ability of P. infestans to thrive in various environmental conditions 
has facilitated its widespread distribution and emergence as a major pathogen 
responsible for substantial crop losses in tomatoes worldwide (fry et al., 2016). 
2.2. Disease development and lifecycle. 
The development of late blight disease is influenced by several environment 
factors including temperature, humidity and leaf wetness duration optimal 
temperature ranges between 15-25 degrees with relative humidity >90% or 
prolonged leaf wetness (Gonzalez ,et al .,2021) under these conditions the 
sporangia produced by p.infestans can germinate rapidily and infect the host 
tissue. The pathogen can undergo both sexual and asexual life cycle. The asexual 
life cycle of Phytophthora infestans is characterized by alternating phases of 
hyphal growth, sporulation, sporangia germination (either through zoospore 
release or direct germination, i.e. germ tube emergence from the sporangium), 
and the re-establishment hypha growth.(Nowicki,et al.,2013). 
2.3. Economic importance of late blight in the tomato production. 
The economic implications of p.infestans outbreaks are profound, as late blight 
can lead to catastrophic yield losses, often exceeding 50% in severely affected 
areas within a short span of time (Duarte c et al., 2018). The pathogen’s rapid 
reproduction and adaptability through genetic mutations enable it to overcome 
host resistance through genetic mutations enable it to overcome host resistance 
and fungicide application, hence this necessitates continuous management efforts 
(Duarte c et al., 2018). So the fear of late blight prompts farmers to apply 
fungicides prophylactically and multiple sprays to overcome it which affects the 
growers economically (Yang et al.,2023). 
 

9 
 
2.4.0 Control methods. 
2.4.1 Biological control/eco-friendly management 
This method is gaining importance due to the negative impacts of chemicals. A 
study found that leaf extracts from onions, garlic, Malus toringo revealed positive 
inhibition of the mycelial growth of P. infestans. Other antagonists such as Bacillus 
subtilis B5 and Trichoderma viride have also been found to be effective. (Lal et al., 
2017) 
2.4.3 Host resistance  
The use of resistant varieties is among the most effective and environmentally safe 
tools for late blight management (FAO, 2008).  
The host plant resistance reduces the incidence of late blight; delays the onset and 
development of disease and the required number of sprays. Plant resistance for 
late blight started with the introduction of the resistance gene (R-gene) though it 
has been broken by virulent strains (Binyam et al., 2014). 
2.4.4. Chemical management; 
Fungicides application remains the most prevalent method of managing late blight 
in tomatoes. There are several fungicides available for late-blight management 
such as; Mancozeb, Mancozeb+ Metalaxyl, Ridomil Gold, indofila, Mancolaxyl, 
(Mancozeb and Metalaxy-M), Fungomil, Mancolaxyl 72% among others (Haverkort, 
et al., 2012). Generally, the fungicide application has been the only reliable 
management for late blight however, the consistent use has led to the 
development of systemic fungicide resistance in P. infestans. The genetic diversity 
complicates management strategies as different strains may respond differently to 

10 
 
control measures tasking for introduction of newer fungicides to divert the 
pathogen. 
2.5. Chorax72% fungicide. 
Chorax72 % fungicide contains cymoxanil8%and mancozeb64%. It has a dual mode 
of action as both a protective and a curative fungicide as per the properties of its 
active ingredients making it a valuable tool in the disease management. 
2.5.1. Mode of action. 
 Studies indicate that cymoxanil operates through its ability to cause cell death in 
pathogen its less toxic to beneficial microbial populations (NA & MS, 2016). It 
controls diseases during the incubation period and prevents the appearance of 
damage on the crop. ((Safety et al., 2024). Mancozeb, a dithiocarbonate, disrupts 
the 
pathogen’s 
extracellular 
enzyme 
production 
and 
spore 
germination 
mechanisms (fry, 2016). 
2.5.2. Field trials of cymoxanil + mancozeb combinations. 
Studies have shown that a combination cymoxanil and mancozeb is highly effective 
in controlling late blight when applied as a prophylactic measure (before 
appearance of disease symptom) as well as curative. (Sharma, 2013). Based on the 
field study comparing different fungicides in the management of late blight in 
potatoes "}(NA & MS, 2016), Recent studies on the investigation of the efficacy of 
fungicides in controlling the late blight shows that a combination of cymoxanil and 
mancozeb fungicides proved to be more effective in controlling the late blight 
disease of tomatoes and it had a positive impact  on the yield of tomatoes(Das, 
2022). A study by (Debnath S., et al 2009) also recorded that there was lowest 
disease severity observed in the treatment with the mixture of sprays of mancozeb 

11 
 
64%+ cymoxanil8%-72%wp@1500g/ha as compared to other sprays like infinity 
68.75% and metalaxyl8%+mancozeb 64%-72 wp when used in the management of 
late blight disease. This gives its potential but still this formulation is not adopted 
in the country by the farmers.

CHAPTER THREE. 
3.0. Methodology. 
3.1. Experimental site. 
The experiment was conducted at Makerere University Agricultural Research 
Institute Kabanyolo (MUARIK) field. MUARIK is located on spatial coordinates 
0˚27'60''N, 32˚36'24'' E  at an altitudinal range of 1250m to 1320 m above mean sea 
level (Yost, D et al., 1990). The study site is within in the administrative 
boundaries of Nangabo sub county, Wakiso district abou19 kilometers north of 
Kampala along the Gaya-Zirobwe road, sited on 650 hectares serving as a hub for 
training, research, outreaches and agricultural production. 
 Kabanyolo is part of the Lake Victoria basin that receives an average annual 
precipitation of 1218 mm and slightly drier periods in June to July and December 
to February. The average annual temperature is 21.5˚C making it suitable for 
agricultural projects (Komutunga, E.T. et al.,2001). 
3.2. Materials and equipments 
 The Ansal f2 tomato variety was used for the study, seedlings were raised and 
managed using standard nursery practices at MAURIK. Transplanting was done four 
weeks after seedling emergence with handful of organic manure per plant. Three 
different concentrations of chorax72% fungicide (recommended dosage, 25% higher 
and 25% lower than the recommended dosage), mancozeb as a reference fungicide 
and the untreated were included for comparisons. The agronomic practices that 
are weeding, pruning and gap filling   were done as recommended. 
The equipment used included: knapsack sprayer, Data sheets (hard copies), long 
ruler, disease diagnosis   manuals, tags, pencils, Weighing scale. 

13 
 
3.3. Experimental design. 
The experimental field was laid out in a randomized complete block design with 
replications (Olsson, 1978) The plots size were measuring 3m×3 m with 15 plots. 
Covering the total area of 135 square meters. The seedlings were transplanted at a 
spacing of 50cm ×50 cm with a total of 36 plants per plot. The experiment relied 
entirely on natural infection (Gudero et al., 2018). 
3.3.1. Treatment allocation. 
Treatments were randomly assigned within each replication and properly tagged 
before fungicide application.

3.4. Fungicide application. 
The fungicide chorax72% was applied at recommended dosage of 37.5g/10 liters of 
water, altered the dosage 25% higher the recommended (46.9g/10l), 25% lower the 
recommended (28.1g/10l) and mancozeb at manufacturers dosage (25g/10l). The 
spray started at the appearance of the symptoms of the late blight disease at the 

14 
 
interval of 12 days apart from the control that received zero chemical (Gudero et 
al., 2018). 
3.5. Data collection. 
Each plot had six rows but data collection was limited to the middle four rows 
excluding the boarder plants. Ten plants in each plot were tagged for data 
collection(Poudel et al., 2020). 
3.5.1. Data collection For Objective One: 
 To assess effect of chorax72% fungicide on growth of Phytophthora infestans in 
tomatoes  
Disease severity and incidence. 
To achieve objective one, the whole plant was assessed for severity and incidence. 
The severity of the disease was scored at the scale of 1-4 (Maerere et al.,2010 and 
incidence as percentage by formula (n/N)*100 as by Meya et al.,2015 for three 
times during the experiment. Also, the number of infested leaves, branches and 
fruits were recorded. 
3.5.2 Data collection for Objective Two: 
To determine the effect of altering the fungicide dosages on the yield of tomatoes. 
Yield performance 
At maturity the red tomato fruits were harvested, taken to the lab for yield 
assessment. The tomatoes from each plot were weighed using a weighing scale and 
recorded in grams, calculated the yield increase(gm) and graded into marketable 
and unmarketable fruits (Gudero et al., 2018).

3.6.0. Data analysis. 
Data for both objectives was analyzed using Genstat-12th edition to get the 
means, standard deviations and standard errors. The p-values and the LSD were 
got by running the Analysis of variance (A NOVA). A post-hoc test was done using 
the Bonferroni for the significant difference among the treatments.

4.0. RESULTS. 
4.1 Objective one: To assess the effect of chorax72% fungicide on the progress 
of phytophthora infestans in tomatoes. 
4.1.1 Effect of chorax72% fungicide on P. infestans progress in tomatoes. 
The results in (table:1) presents the mean incidence and severity of late blight 
caused by phytopthora infestans under different treatments using chorax72% 
fungicide. The treatments included varying dosages of chorax72% (25% higher, 
recommended& 25%lower), a reference and zero treatment.  Both the severity and 
incidence were significantly affected by the treatments (p<0.001). The treatment 
with no fungicide application (zero) showed the highest severity of 2.97 ± 0.74d, 
while the treatment with 25% higher than the recommended dosage of chorax72% 
fungicide showed the lowest severity of 1.54 ± 0.60 a. The results also show the 
treatment with Zero fungicide application had the highest disease incidence of 
0.91 ± 0.11d, while the treatment with 25%higher dosage showed the lowest 
incidence with   0.20 ± 0.12 a. 
In table 2, showed that there was highest number of leaf infection in the 
treatment with zero fungicide that is 9.91±5.83c    and the treatment with the 
25%higher showed the lowest number of leaves infected (2.4±2.77a). The highest 
number of fruits infected was recorded from the treatment with no fungicide 
application (1.33±1.71c) while the lowest number of fruit infection was recorded 
from the treatment with 25% higher dosage of chorax72%(0.1±0.31a ).

4.2.1. To determine the effect of altering the fungicide dosages on the yield of 
tomatoes.  
The application of chorax72% fungicide caused statistically significant effect on the 
yield of tomatoes both on the yield weight (p=0.015) and marketable fruits 
(p=0.012). 
The recommended dose produced the highest fruit weight (2574g) which was 
significantly higher than the zero treatment with (872g). Both the recommended 
dosage and 25% higher dose produced the highest number of marketable fruits 
(33.0 and 33.0 fruits) respectively, all of which were significantly higher than the 
zero treatment (8.0 fruits) as shown in figure 2.  The error bars that do not overlap 
one another shows a significant  difference among the treatments .

CHAPTER FIVE. 
5.0 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION. 
5.1 For Objective 1: To assess the effect of chorax72% fungicide on the progress 
of phytophthora infestans in tomatoes 
Results presented in table1, from the experimental trials revealed that all the 
treatments reduced the disease incidence and severity of late blight disease over 
the control (zero treatment). The maximum disease severity (2.967±0.7412) was 
recorded in the control. Among the treatments, lowest was recorded in the 25% 
higher dosage of chorax72%@46.9/10litre of water (1.778±0.71). The maximum 
disease incidence (0.91 ± 0.11d) was recorded in the control (zero treatment) 
whereas the minimal disease incidence (0.2018 ± 0.118 a) recorded from the 25% 
higher dosage. This implies that increasing the dosage above the recommended 
slightly improves the control of disease severity and incidence, untreated plants 
are most vulnerable to the infestation pathogen. Similarly, the findings reinforce 
that using chorax72 fungicide reduced the disease progress as it was when 
moximate (cymoxanil8+mancozeb 64%) had the lowest disease intensity among 
other fungicides (Kumar .P et al., 2018).  
5.2 For objective Two: To determine the effect of altering the fungicide dosages 
on the yield of tomatoes. 
Chorax72% fungicide had a positive effect on the tomato yield of tomatoes which is 
similarly to the study by (R. Das et al.,2022) (figure 2); where the treatment with 
combination of cymoxanil8+mancozeb 64% fungicide had the maximum yield of 
tomatoes as compared to other chemicals. The significant difference in yield 
weights with chorax72% fungicide especially at recommended dose of suggests that 

21 
 
the fungicide effectively controlled the pathogen impact on the crop that might 
otherwise limit fruit development and weight gain. This is supported by previous 
research findings that the fungal infection can significantly reduce the 
photosynthetic capacity and nutrient allocation with   tomato plants for fruit 
development (Smith et al.,2018). 
In the present study, the minimum p. infestans progress and maximum fruit yield 
was found in the treatment with chorax72% fungicide that is 25%higher dosage and 
recommended dosage. This could be explained by the fact that higher dosages 
were efficient enough to inhibit the diseases producing activity of the pathogen in 
the plant, which resulted into a better overall growth and health of the tomato 
plants treated as compared to the other treatments ((Sharma, 2013). However, this 
research did not look at the infestation levels of pathogen at different growth 
stages of tomato yet its also important to know which the pathogen is most 
effective for efficient control.

CHAPTER SIX 
6.0 CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
6.1 Conclusion. 
 For objective one, the hypothesis stated that Chorax72% fungicide has no 
significant effect on the growth of p. infestans in tomatoes. According to the 
results, chorax72% had a significant difference (p<0.001) in late blight disease 
incidence and severity in tomatoes treated with different dosages of chorax72%. 
With low severity and incidence shown in25%higher dosage (1.54± 0.60and0.20 ± 
0.12respectively) and high severity and incidence was observed when no 
chorax72% was applied with (2.97±0.74&0.91 ± 0.11) respectively, therefore with 
these results, I fail to accept the hypothesis. 
For objective two, the hypothesis stated that altering the fungicide dosages will 
have significant effect on the yield of tomatoes and based on the results, there 
was a significant positive effect on the yield(p=0.012). Therefore, there I fail to 
reject the hypothesis 
6.2 Recommendations 
One season evaluation of the chorax72% fungicide cannot give a conclusive 
information about its effectiveness thus a need for further assessment. Therefore, 
further study should be done for over three seasons and on what stage the disease 
effects on the crop are more severe.
