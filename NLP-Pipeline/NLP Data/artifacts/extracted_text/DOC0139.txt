ABSTRACT 
 
This research was aimed at the Impact of Local Services Tax and Service Delivery to the 
people of Bugujju, Mukono Central Division. The study was based on three main objectives 
which were: To find out the impact of local service tax on service delivery, to find out if 
taxpayers are aware of all tax obligations and policies, to determine the level of service 
delivery to the people and to find out problems faced by taxpayers and their businesses. 
The researcher used both qualitative and quantitative research designs with a sample of 80 
respondents. Qualitative data was obtained through questionnaires, interviews, and 
observation while quantitative data was obtained through computation and analysis. The 
collected data was analyzed using Microsoft Excel and presented in the form of tables. 
The study findings revealed that there is a significant relationship between Local Service Tax 
and Service Delivery in Buguju indicated by a correlation of r = 0.677. The research findings 
showed that 90% of respondents agreed that they had a problem with the mode of assistance 
80% with the mode of tax collection and 51.6% of the respondents revealed that there is too 
much inefficiency among tax collectors. 
The study recommends measures for LST collection like training tax collectors, sensitizing 
the masses, etc. The study suggests that future studies should be conducted to analyze any 
other factors that affect revenue collection as well as services delivered by the local 
government. 
The study concludes that town agents have challenges in revenue collection but such 
problems were not beyond control and also service is delivered according to the amount of 
revenue collected since it’s a source of government funding for community services.

CHAPTER ONE. 
INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND  
1.0 Introduction  
Local Services Tax. Local Service Tax is to generate revenue for the local government to 
fund various services and infrastructure projects within the community.  
Service Delivery: refers to the provision of services and benefits that are funded by the 
revenue generated from the tax. 
Location of Bugujju. It is located in the Mukono Central Division  
 
1.1Background of the study  
 
The Local Service Tax was introduced by the local governments (Amendment) (No.2) ACT, 
of 2008 which allowed the local governments to levy, collect, and charge additional taxes in 
order to provide new sources of revenue for local governments, and for related purposes. 
The Local Service Tax (LST) is to be levied on the wealth and income of the following 
categories of people; persons in gainful employment, self-employed and practicing 
professionals, self-employed artisans, businessmen and businesswomen, and the assessment 
is to be fair, equitable, and non- regressive: 
However, the salaries of the following categories of people are exempted from LST; members 
of the Uganda Police Force, Members of the Uganda Prisons Service, Members of the 
Uganda People’s Defense Forces, unemployed persons, and people unable to earn a minimum 
income to access basic necessities of life and members of the Diplomatic Missions 
Accredited Missions to Uganda. 
Service delivery is the processes and methods through which tax-related services are 
provided to individuals, businesses, and other entities by tax authorities or professionals. It 
involves the administration, collection, and enforcement of taxes, as well as providing 
assistance and guidance to taxpayers. Examples of services delivered are; maintenance of 
roads, garbage collection, and Education services among others. 
Mukono Central Division is an administrative division located in Mukono Municipality, 
which is situated in the Central Region of Uganda. Mukono Municipality is approximately 21 
kilometers east of the Capital City, Kampala. Mukono Central Division is one of the divisions 
that make up the municipality. 

2 
 
Mukono Central Division covers an area that includes both urban and peri-urban areas. It is a 
highly populated division with a mix of residential, commercial, and institutional activities. 
The division is known for its vibrant economy and diverse population. 
The division is characterized by a range of amenities and facilities, including schools, 
hospitals, markets, banks, and government offices. It is also home to several higher education 
institutions, including Uganda Christian University, which is one of the prominent 
universities in the country. 
1.2 Statement of the problem. 
Local Service Taxes are raised by the government to generate revenue used to deliver 
services to the public in various fields like health, education, and infrastructure as this will 
help to improve on the performance of different businesses. 
Despite the payments of the local service tax by the locals of Bugujju, the service delivery by 
the local government is still poor. There are no garbage containers at the different points 
which has resulted in poor waste disposal exposing the local people to the risk of contracting 
diseases like cholera. There are poor roads with a lot of dust which has a negative impact on 
businesses dealing in food commodities like restaurants which limit the number of customers. 
Some roads are inaccessible due to deep potholes which hinders motor vehicles from 
delivering services to some parts of the community within Bugujju.

CHAPTER TWO 
LITERATURE REVIEW 
2.0 Introduction 
This chapter looks at Local Service Tax and its impact on service delivery to the local people. 
It consists of existing literature on Taxation (local service tax) by different research studies 
from magazines, textbooks, journals, and newspapers. 
This chapter covers Taxation (local service tax), classification, and purpose of Local Services 
Tax. However, it particularly addresses the problems affecting taxpayers, the awareness of the 
tax obligation and service delivery to the locals, and the theoretical review. 
2.1 The Concept of Local Service Tax. 
This refers to the assessment, collection, administration, and management of local revenue in 
Uganda. It deals with raising public revenue and managing public expenditure and debt. It is 
the responsibility of the local government who represent the Uganda Revenue Authority 
(URA) at the municipal level (Manasseh,2010). The general idea behind the taxation is the 
provision of public goods and services. 
Taxation (Local Service Tax) is a payment that cannot be avoided without attracting a 
punishment and in return of which no gain/ quid pro-quo is promised by the government to 
the taxpayer (Balunywa,2018). The government is responsible for providing its citizens with 
certain public facilities and services like roads, hospitals, schools, and market securities. 
There are two main tax authorities; the Local Government Authority and the Central 
Government Authority (URA). 
2.2 The purpose of taxation (Local Service Tax). 
According to the Income Tax Act (2017), Local Service Tax is an important source of 
government revenue and an economic policy tool for the government to attain economic 
growth. The importance of taxation therefore raises a debate about whether the government 
should interfere in the operations of market mechanism. Income Tax Act (2014) further noted 
that taxes may be levied for other reasons but revenue remains the prime objective of most 
taxes. 

6 
 
Balunywa (2018) noted that local service tax has increased in importance not only as a tool 
for raising revenue for traditional roles but also for accelerating economic growth and 
ensuring social justice.  
According to the Uganda Economic Journal (2013), taxes can reduce the quality of resources 
consumed by the private sector. The Economic Journal (2013) also shows that, in stressing 
the consumption-reducing aspect, taxes may change the distribution of income and help to 
stabilize the economy. 
2.2.1 Taxpayer’s knowledge. 
Most Ugandans have a poor understanding of the rationale of taxes and knowledge of the 
different taxes imposed on them (Copying with Taxes 2016). As a result, the tax compliance 
in Uganda is still very low. Besides that, various surveys conducted on local businesses 
suggest that about 60% of them keep no records at all, while 25% keep partial records 
making it difficult to assess taxes (Ndandiko, 2010). 
Therefore, there is a need to sensitize the public, especially business owners. The 
sensitization should be done on not only local service tax but different taxes like trading 
licenses etc. that impact business owners and the rationale that underlines the imposition of 
taxes because taxpayers are not aware of the reasons for paying taxes, evasion of tax duties, 
laws and regulations are very rampant. (World Bank Survey, 2014) 
2.3 Tax policy. 
The World Bank has influenced many countries in undertaking tax reform policies. In the 
case of Uganda, the tax base has remained significantly narrow since independence, leading 
to inadequate tax revenue. By 2004, the tax ratio of tax revenue to GDP was just 18-20%. The 
composition of tax revenue has been predominantly important. Small business is taxed 
differently compared to corporate businesses with an annual turnover of above 50 million 
shillings. As quoted by Kitinisa (2003),  
2.4 Approaches to Tax Administration. 
According to Bird (2014), tax administration refers to the identification of a taxpayer, 
collection, and enforcement of tax liability. According to Olman (2017), tax administration 
refers to a structure of identification of potential taxpayers, collection, and laws governing 
taxation. 

7 
 
Roy Bahi (2018) says that much attention should be paid to critical aspects of tax 
administration, training, procedures, staffing, collection, and use of information. The 
weaknesses in tax administration are mainly a lack of relevant information about taxpayers, 
and continued criticism of tax and its structure. The tax structure should be simple in order to 
avoid tax evasion. 
2.4.1 Identification of a Tax Payer. 
Taxes are levied on individuals, groups/legal entities' income earned. The identification of a 
taxpayer is done with reference to natural/ artificial persons who can earn income. 
However, for the purpose of this research, we shall confine ourselves to business as a 
taxpayer and a business can be defined as a vocation, trade, profession, or adventure in the 
nature of trade but does not include employment (Income Act, 2017). 
2.4.2 Implementation of Revenue Plan and Services Delivery. 
Implementation of a revenue plan entails indicators namely, motivating staff, capacity 
building, and recruitment of skilled staff. The indicators are explained below in line with 
service delivery by several scholars for instance Abelson(2006) stressed that the local 
governments are capable of providing public services, mobilizing community resources, 
stimulating private investments, expanding rural-urban linkages, adopting national 
development to local conditions and investing in local infrastructure based on collected low 
revenue. This was found to be true of Buguju as it had failed in its attempt to successfully hit 
the revenue threshold therefore negatively affecting the delivery of local services to its 
community. 
Similarly, Onwe(2009) reveals that the manpower capacity of the local government 
competition with the staff of the local government will not yield the desired result. And that 
there is a skilled gap among the few senior staff of the local government. The new revenue 
forecast issues have since remained complex even though the local government does not have 
the technical capacity to mobilize for local revenue since what they actually plan does not 
confirm the actual collected hence a revenue gap.  
2.4.3 Revenue expenditure control and service delivery. 
Revenue expenditure control entails three indicators namely budget implementation review, 
quarterly audit reports, and quarterly progress performance report. The indicators are 

8 
 
explained below in line with services delivery by several scholars for instance Todd(2009) 
argues that accountability involves citizens, government, and services providers. The scholars 
argue that it is important to recognize and strengthen systems of mutual accountability and 
partnership at the local level inclusive of Local governments. The ability to ensure joint 
responsibility for service delivery runs the risk of everyone’s responsibility becoming no 
one’s responsibility. In addition, Mbufu (2011) further argues that formalizing a revenue 
enhancement plan, budget priority allocations and effectively implementing the plan are 
issues that can better service delivery. On the contrary, Nananya (2003) recommends that in 
order to enhance local government revenue, accountability of such revenue would be seen in 
terms of the quality and quantity of public services extended to the local communities. The 
scholars further note accessing such services would drive more people to pay the tax that is 
allocated to the provision of such services however Local governments would register more 
taxes if it strengthened the enforcement of laws and adherence to revenue controls. In this 
study, it was found that Buguju collected more local revenue base whenever its staff observed 
the Local government's local revenue controls. 
Luzige (2008) receipts that sources of revenue for instance parking fees, rent, licenses, and 
permits among others are instrumental in realizing service delivery in Local governments 
including expenditure on health, education, sports and technical services, roads, and 
community and welfare. To the scholar, any increase in local revenue collection improved 
service delivery thus a significant relationship between local revenue performance and 
services delivery. 
Pradeep (2011) classified reports in Local Government (LG) as being financial reports, 
council reports, and performance reports among others. He further explains that financial 
reports are formal records of a business or organization's financial activities while Mbufu 
(2013), argues that records are used by the management for decision-making as they are used 
for future references to know which period had a decline in revenue collection and which one 
had the highest collections. The scholar adds that records and reports are used for audit 
purposes and as supporting documents in case a local government is to request funds from the 
central government and donors (Okotie,2010). 
 
 
Other factors that affect local services tax and business are; 

9 
 
 Government policies; According to Richard (2015), unfavorable government policies on 
taxation such as increased taxes paid by businesses in the form of local services tax greatly 
hinder business performance as this increases the costs of operation thereby reducing 
profitability and financial performance in general. 
Level of Technology: According to Laveens (2016). Technology affects both taxation and 
service delivery. Proper adoption of technology eases tax collection and administration thus 
improving the process of taxation. On the other hand, most of the owners of businesses rarely 
adhere to technological advancement as this gives the tax bodies the authority to take the 
loopholes in the knowledge of business owners to exploit them thereby reducing the 
performance of their businesses. 
Attitude of the taxpayers; A negative attitude toward taxation greatly leads to tax evasion 
where taxpayers deliberately refuse to pay the taxes. This forces the tax bodies to look for 
those who dodge paying taxes and end up closing their business premises thus reducing their 
time of operation thence leading to poor or no delivery of services especially in the months 
when business premises are closed (Kanisa, 2014). 
2.4.4 Taxes and Profit Levels. 
The taxable profits of the business are always different from the normal business account 
profits for three major reasons; 
 i. Certain income which may be considered in the normal accounting system may not be 
liable to tax. 
ii. Certain expenses that are deducted on profit and loss account may not be available when 
determining taxable income, 
iii. Some tax allowances may be provided and will not be reflected in the business account. 
(Manasseh T. 2000). 
Gordon and Dawson (2017) assert that many business people have complained probably with 
some justification that taxes interfere with the opportunities to re-invest their profits in their 
businesses. 
 
 

10 
 
2.4.5 Summary of literature review. 
In a nutshell, local revenue management is treated as a multidimensional variable that 
constitutes components namely revenue planning, mobilization, and revenue control for the 
case of this study. Revenue enhancement planning is categorized as the identification of 
revenue resources, assessment, and enforcement where local revenue if well collected can be 
realized through timely enforcement while implementation of a revenue plan entails 
motivating staff, capacity building, and recruitment of skilled staff. Further to note, revenue 
expenditure control entails implementation reviews, quarterly audit reports, and quarterly 
progress performance reports. Local governments are capable of providing public services, 
mobilizing community resources, stimulating private investments, expanding rural-urban 
linkages, adopting national development to local conditions, and investing in local 
infrastructure based on the collected low revenue. Local revenue can be improved and 
strengthened through accountability to enable taxpayers to appropriately relate tax paid to 
service delivery coupled with the strengthening enforcement of laws governing the 
administration and collection of taxes. Gaps identified include declining local revenue 
sources, political interference, and unfair procedures for revenue collection, and planning 
which cause mistrust causing tax invasion.

CHAPTER THREE 
METHODOLOGY 
3.0 Introduction  
This chapter covered the background on how data was gathered. It discusses the research 
design, study population, sampling, and study variables, sources of data, data collection 
methods and instruments, data processing, analysis and presentation, and limitations of the 
study. 
3.1 Research design. 
 Cross-sectional survey design based on the use of qualitative and quantitative approaches 
that were adopted to establish the relationship between Local Services Tax and Services 
delivery.  This design was used for profiling, defining, segmentation, estimating, predicting, 
and examining associative relationships. Cross-sectional studies easily provide a quick 
snapshot of what’s going on with the variables for the research problem. 
3.2 Study population. 
The study comprised of 100 Managers/owners and employees of businesses in Buguju, 
Mukono Central Division. 
3.3 Sampling. 
3.3.1 Sampling design. 
The sampling design was used to select representative elements or respondents from the 
target or accessible population. In this research, I used both purposive and simple random 
sampling methods; this involved selecting respondents randomly and random interviews of 
the chosen officials. This technique or design helped me get unbiased data since purposive 
sampling could enable me to deal with respondents who have adequate information about the 
impact of Local Service Tax on service delivery. 
3.3.2 Sample size 
The study involved 80 respondents. The researcher assumed that this sample size would 
be representative enough for the entire population. 
3.3.3 Sampling procedure.

3.3 Sample size. 
The sample size of the study was determined using the Slovene formula of sample 
determination. Under this, a target population of 100 respondents was zeroed down to a 
sample size of 80 respondents respectively as stated by Slovene (1978). The Slovene formula 
was used to determine the minimum sample size. 
n =       N/1+Ne2 = 100/1+100(0.05)2  
=80 respondents  
n=number of samples  
N=total population 
e=level of significance 0.05 
Using the formula above, a sample of 80 respondents was obtained 
3.4 Study variables. 
The independent variable was the impact of Local Services Tax; the dependent variable was 
Service Delivery to the people and their businesses and the intervening variable was the 
government policies. That is to say, the study was carried out to establish the relationship 
between how Local Services Tax affects service delivery to the people and businesses 
in Buguju, Mukono Central Division. 
3.5 Sources of data. 
Two sources of data were used for the purposes of research, these were primary data and 
secondary data. 
3.6.1 Secondary Data Collection. 
Secondary data for this study was obtained from different sources like; reading publications 
and textbooks as well as journals, magazines, and newspapers written by different authors 
concerning the impact of local services tax on service delivery. 
3.6.2 Primary Data. 
 Primary data was used to get information from the respondents through face-to-face 
information and the use of questionnaires to collect data from respondents. The primary 

13 
 
source of data was used because it enabled me to observe and get information directly from 
the activities that take place in Buguju, Mukono Central Division. 
3.7 Methods of data collection and instruments. 
3.7.1 Questionnaires. 
The questionnaire helped to collect information from various respondents compared to other 
methods such as interviews; primary data was collected through the administration of written 
questionnaire guides to fill in., The questionnaire guide contained both closed and open-
ended questions which could allow the collection of qualitative and quantitative data. The 
questionnaire was designed in a simple way or manner for the respondents to be able to 
understand the questions. In addition, the questionnaire design was time-saving for both the 
researcher and the respondents 
3.7.2 Interview method. 
The interview method involved the use of a semi-structured interview approach to collect 
qualitative data. The method helped to collect sensitive information about the study which is 
not possible to get using a questionnaire, it helped to obtain more detailed information about 
the study, however, it was time-consuming as information was captured from highly 
designated respondents and took more resources to execute as schedules, meetings are always 
fixed and reschedules time and again. 
3.8 Data processing analysis and presentation. 
3.8.1 Data processing. 
Data collected was checked for completeness, categorized, coded, and entered into a 
computer where it was summarised into frequency tables. 
3.8.2 Data analysis. 
The data was analyzed automatically using SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences). 
The SPSS package was opted for because it handles a large number of variables. 
3.8.3 Data Presentation. 
Quantitative data was presented in the form of descriptive statistics using frequency tables. 
Qualitative data was sorted and grouped into themes, The researcher thereafter evaluated and 
analyzed the adequacy of information in answering the research questions through coding of 

14 
 
data and identifying categories and parameters that emerged in the responses to the variables 
of the study. Qualitative data was presented using narrative text. 
3.9 Limitations of the study. 
Financial constraints: Financing the research study was too costly in terms of feeding and 
processing the report. 
Non-response: Some owners of businesses in the community were busy attending to their 
customers and spared no time for me Lastly, there was a language barrier with the few elders 
who couldn’t speak English hence making communication difficult.

CHAPTER FOUR 
DATA PRESENTATION, ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION OF THE FINDINGS 
4.0 Introduction. 
This chapter presents data analysis, tables, and figures that were presented and interpretations 
made in accordance with the research objectives of the study. The chapter was divided into 
sub-chapters namely: demographic characteristics of respondents and findings in relationship 
to the objectives of the study. 
4.1 Demographic characteristics of respondents. 
The respondents’ demographic characteristics include; age, gender, level of education, and 
level of experience. 
4.2.1 Age of the respondents 
The respondents were required to indicate their ages and the distribution of the 
respondents by age is shown in Figure 4.1.

From Figure 4.2, the study revealed that the largest number of respondents were in the age 
group of 31-35years (4l)5l%, these were followed by those in the range of 36-40 

16 
 
 40 years (16)20% and the smallest number was those who were in the range of 41 and above 
years and above who were (5)6.7% respondents. This implies that most of the respondents 
were in the age range of 31-35 years. 
4.1.2 Gender of the Respondent. 
The study captured the gender of the respondents in order to establish the most dominant 
business people in Buguju. The respondents were asked to state their sex and the distributions 
are shown in table 4.1.

According to the results for the gender of the respondents in Table 4.1, of the 80 respondents, 
the majority were males (50) contributing 62.5% of the total sample of the entire sample. 
This therefore implies that the most dominant business people are males. 
4.23 Level of Education of the Respondents 
I asked the respondents to state their level of education to find out whether the respondents 
could be able to interpret the questionnaires given to them. The findings indicated that all the 
respondents in the targeted group had relevant knowledge to read, interpret, and answer the 
questionnaires given to them by the researcher as presented in Table 4.

From Figure 4.1.1, 7.50% had attained primary level of education, 26.25% had certificates, 
16.25% had diplomas, 25.0% had acquired degrees and 2.5% of the respondents had attained 
secondary as their highest level of education. This means that the majority of respondents 
were literate and able to understand and internalize the contents of the questionnaires. 
 
4.1.4 Time spent in the business 
The respondents were asked to state the period they had spent in their businesses and the 
findings showed that most of the respondents had spent reasonable time in doing business as 
captured in table 4.2.

The findings in Table 4.2 indicated that out of the 80 respondents, the majority had spent 3-4 
years in business (44)56.6%, followed by those who had spent 4 years and above on their 
current job (l8)22.2%, then those who had spent 2-3 years were (12)l5.6% and the least 
number of respondents who had spent less than 2 years on their job and these were (6)6.7%. 
This implies that most of the respondents had experience concerning the effect of local 
services tax on the delivery of services within Buguju. 
4.2 Awareness of the Taxpayers. 
Respondents were asked if they were aware of the taxes they pay if a business has ever been 
assessed for tax purposes, if any records were kept by the firm, how records are kept if the tax 
authority has given any assistance as regards tax awareness, and what kind of assistance. 
According to the information I got, 80.0% agreed that they were aware of the taxes they 
ought to pay while 20.0% indicated that they were not aware of all the taxes that they were 

18 
 
meant to pay. Most business entrepreneurs in Buguju were therefore aware of the local 
services tax that they were supposed to pay. 
4.2.1 Tax assessment 
Respondents were asked if they had ever been assessed for tax purposes, the table 
below illustrates their responses.

indicated that they were not certain, 15.0%disagreed and 15%strongly disagreed. In all, the 
majority 55.0% agreed that their businesses had been assessed for purposes of paying local 
services tax among others. This implies that URA through the town agents carries out 
assessments of the businesses before the tax they are meant to pay is levied.

4.2.2 Assistance as regards tax awareness 
The researcher asked respondents if the business entrepreneurs have received any assistance 
as regards tax awareness and the form of assistance. The table below illustrates how they 
responded.

Over 20% of the respondents who agreed to have received assistance, said it was in the form 
of manuals, this means that there were very few workshops that could have been more 
effective in terms of creating awareness to the taxpayers.

According to Table 4.6, the results show that natural assistance given to taxpayers is poor. 
This is from the fact that 71.7% of the respondents disagreed that the methods used were fair 
with a rejection mean of 2.15, and 66.7% of the respondents rejected the statement that 
whenever taxes are collected from them, taxes are fair with a rejection mean of 2.29 and also 
75% rejected the statement tax authorities do not harass them whenever they come to collect 
taxes with a mean of 2.15.

According to Table 4.7, among the businesses sampled, no business does not pay tax, 68.3% 
pay an average tax of 10,000 to 19,000/=, and 16.7% pay on average between 20,000 to 
29,000/= while 15.0% of the businesses pay between 30,000 to 39,000/= The above results 
show that community in Buguju were paying more money in local revenue.

From Table 4.9, 48.3% disagreed that the tax officials are effective in identifying and 
registering potential taxpayers while 23.3% strongly agreed, l5% were uncertain, 10% agreed 
and 3.3% strongly disagreed. Since 51.6% of the respondents disagreed, it implies that there 
is too much inefficiency among the tax collectors within Mukono Central Division. 
4.3.3 Specific effects of the Local Revenue on businesses. 
The following are specific effects that were given by the proprietors of Buguju. 
Loss of sakes; This is mainly a result of the closure of business premises by Mukono Local 
government staff on default During the time when the premises are closed, operation is halted 
therefore no sales are made. 
Loss of equipment; This happens due to rough handling by the enforcement and Local town 
agents’ staff, Sometimes machines and equipment are confiscated by the tax collectors when 
the owners have failed to meet the tax obligations and during confiscation, equipment is 
damaged and sometimes lost. 

23 
 
Loss of stock. Some business proprietors said they also lose capital as a result of heavy fines 
imposed on them when they default on their tax obligations. 
Inconveniencing business operations; This happens when the staff of the tax authority visits 
business premises in the routine check-ups on business. Sometimes they ask for books of 
accounts and try to interview the business owners and in the process, they inconvenience 
business operations. 
 From the above-mentioned effects, it was noted that 40% of businesses in Buguju lose 
capital as a result of heavy fines imposed on them when they default on their tax obligation, 
4.3.4 Suggestions from Taxpayers. 
Respondents were asked to give suggestions on how their problems can be dealt with. The 
following were the responses.  
Tax authorities should improve or increase the period of deadlines that they give out to 
taxpayers when giving warnings. 
More efforts should be put into tax education so as to increase awareness and understanding 
of the mode of assessment.  
4.3.5 The services that have been delivered to the people of Buguju. 
 The study findings indicate that 96% of the respondents agreed that their Services have been 
delivered to the Buguju community while 4% said that there are no services delivered.

CHAPTER FIVE 
SUMMARY OF MAJOR FINDINGS, CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
5.0 Introduction 
This chapter presents a summary of major findings, conclusions, and recommendations on the 
findings. 
5.1 Summary of major findings 
5.1.1 Awareness of the Taxpayers. 
From the findings of the study according to a questionnaire answered by some entrepreneurs, 
80.0% agreed that they were aware of the taxes they ought to pay while 20.0% indicated that 
they were not aware of all the taxes that they were meant to pay. Most business entrepreneurs 
in Buguju were therefore aware of the taxes that they were supposed to pay. The findings also 
revealed that 3l.7% of the business entrepreneurs strongly agreed that their businesses have 
ever been assessed for tax purposes, 23.3% agreed, 15.0% indicated that they were not 
certain, disagreed, and strongly disagreed respectively. In all, the majority 55.0% agreed that 
their businesses had been assessed for purposes of paying taxes. This implies that URA 
through the town agent carries out assessments of the businesses before the tax they are 
meant to pay is levied. 
 
5.1.2 Services delivered to the people of Buguju community 
According to the major findings, 34% of the respondents cited garbage collection as one of 
the services delivered to the Buguju community. In their view, the respondents contended that 
the Local revenue has helped the division to remain smart by daily collection of Garbage. 
 
 
5.1.3 Problems faced by taxpayers 
The findings of the study showed that 90% of the respondents agreed that they had a problem 
with the mode of assistance and also 80% of the respondents agreed that they had a problem 
with the mode of tax collection and 51.6% of the respondents revealed that there is too much 
inefficiency among the tax collectors in Mukono Central division. 
 
 
 

26 
 
5.2 Conclusion of the study. 
5.2.1 Awareness of the Taxpayers. 
The findings of the study revealed that most of the owners of income-generating enterprises 
in Buguju are aware of the Local Revenue they pay and how much they pay. However, it was 
also discovered that Business owners had not received any assistance from the tax authority 
towards tax awareness. More so, the results showed that the nature of assistance given to 
taxpayers is poor as it was revealed that the methods used are not fair, taxes are not fair and it 
was also discovered that tax authorities harass taxpayers whenever they go to collect taxes. 
 
5.2.2. Problems faced by taxpayers. 
The findings of the study showed that Income-generating enterprises have a problem with the 
mode of assistance and the mode of tax collection. It was also found out that there is too 
much inefficiency among the tax collectors in Buguju. 
 
 5.3 Recommendations 
5.3.1 Awareness of the Taxpayers 
 URA through the local government should find a way of assessing the Local revenue in that 
the different categories of qualified people should pay early in the financial year in order to 
give enough time to the businesses to pay their dues rather than make an assessment and 
demand for payment spontaneously. 
The tax authorities should introduce a scheme that allows taxpayers to pay the tax obligation 
in installments over a given period of time as opposed to a lump sum at once. 
 
5.3.2 Local Revenue amount paid by the people of Buguju. 
URA should revise the amount of tax paid as it was revealed that businesses are charged 
highly. 
 
5.3.3 Problems faced by taxpayers. 
URA should reach out and educate the business community about its different tax rates and 
modes of payment. The study revealed that the biggest problem with the Local Revenue paid 
is in fact that the community does not understand how the tax is arrived at as well as how it is 
paid but not because it is too high with the introduction of the new technology IRAS 
(Integrated Revenue Administrated System). 

27 
 
URA should improve on the methods of collecting local revenue. It should adopt the closure 
of business premises on default only as a last resort after all the other methods of collection 
have failed. This should be an exception and not a rule. 
 
5.3.4 Assessment of the locals of Buguju by the enforcement team. 
The terms for locking the business should be revised especially by allowing Businesses to 
pay in installments as the findings of the study revealed that locking the business as a result 
of local revenue reduces the operations and income generated. 
 
5.4 Areas for further research. 
The researcher carried out this study in order to examine the impact of local revenue on 
service delivery as a case study but the study was not exhaustive owing to constraints in 
terms of scope, time, and finance. Further research is therefore needed in areas such as; 
 
 i) Factors leading to tax evasion among businesses in Buguju, Mukono Central Division.
