ABSTRACT 
 
Gender inequality is a prevalent issue in Ugandan newsrooms, with men being 
dominant, women less represented and at a high chance of facing harassments in the 
work environment. This research focuses on gender dynamics in Uganda’s newsrooms 
with special attention to Power FM. From feminist theory perspective, this topic 
investigates the issue of women representation in leadership positions, gender bias in 
news content as well as experiences that female journalists undergo.  
The outcomes indicate a wide gap between men and women journalists perpetuating 
stereotypes about gender and limiting opportunities for females. The study therefore 
calls for policies and practices that are sensitive to gender dimensions so as to redress 
systemic gender inequality within Uganda’s media industry. It contributes to the 
ongoing dialogue on media and gender by emphasizing how inclusive newsrooms 
promote diversity of views while ensuring equal representation. 
 The suggestions given by this study might benefit individuals working towards achieving 
fairer media systems both inside Uganda and at international levels like researchers, 
practitioners and policy makers. Particularly, some strategies would be suggested based 
on findings from this research for consideration. I.e. increasing women’s representation 
in leadership positions, addressing gender bias in news coverage, and creating a more 
supportive work environment for female workers. 
This study has reviewed gender inequalities that exist within Ugandan newsrooms using 
a specific case of Power FM. Using representation, opportunity, and treatment of 
women working at the place as measures, the research found vast differences that exist 
in this company owing to a lack of diversity and perpetuation of stereotypes and biases 
based on gender. The data are showing underrepresentation in leadership positions, 
discrimination on gender grounds, stereotypical reporting of women.

Recommendations: 
 
Therefore, this study prescribes that Power FM must commit to changing its system 
through periodic training on diversity and inclusion; updating policies and practices to 
scan and mitigate systemic barriers to gender equality; and ensuring staff have equal 
understanding and equal responsibility in these development merits. The study 
recommends specifically: 
Mandatory training for the entire staff from entry-level workers to other leadership 
positions 
It should review hiring, promotion guidelines, and editorial processes against fair 
promotions to ensure they do not have a bias; secondly, it should develop a Diversity 
and Inclusion strategy that will realize gender equality and an inclusive culture at the 
workplace. 
Implementation of these recommendations may be how Power FM increases gender 
equality, diversity, and inclusion, and thus impacts the reputation of the company while 
furthering the cause of a more equitable media landscape in Uganda.

CHAPTER ONE 
 
1.0 Introduction  
The inequality is still business as usual in most media houses, especially in Uganda, 
where cultural and institutional barriers still limit women's participation in journalism. 
This chapter reviews how far or near to equality the Ugandan newsrooms are, with a 
specific focus on Power FM. 
1.2 Background  
Gender inequality is a world-wide problem, but it is pronounced in Uganda. Uganda is 
ranked 78th out of 146 countries in terms of gender equality according to the world 
economic forum’s global gender gap report 2023(WEF_GGGR_2023, n.d.) Gender 
inequality Is due to several factors, including stereotypes and biases, pay gap, lack of 
presentation, work life balance, harassment and discrimination. 
On the global scale, inequality between women and men is still part of a major 
challenge. According to the United Nations, women hold only 24% of all parliamentary 
seats worldwide(2020-Women in Parliament_EN-LR_0, n.d.). Women are underrepresented 
in leading positions in the most various spheres. Women lack equal rights in education 
levels and job offers; the female labor force participation rate amounts to 64% globally, 
while the male rate is 76%(The Gender Gap in Employment: What’s Holding Women Back? - 
InfoStories, n.d.). 
Gender equality is fast becoming a reality in the African region. The African 
Development Bank, however, reports that women remain a meager 24 percent of 
Africa's parliamentary seats and hold disproportionately few leadership positions in 
most spheres of life(Gender, 2020). Women in Africa also experience high rates of 
gender-based violence, with 45 percent having reported being victims of sexual or 
physical violence(Devastatingly Pervasive: 1 in 3 Women Globally Experience Violence, n.d.). 
 

2 
 
The causes of gender inequality in Africa are complex, multi-dimensional, and 
multifaceted, also encompassing cultural and societal norms that cause discrimination 
against women, limited economic opportunities, and poor legal systems that protect 
women's rights(ACCELERATE GENDER EQUALITY FOR A SUSTAINABLE, RESILIENT, AND INCLUSIVE 
FUTURE, n.d.). 
The news media industry in Uganda is no exception to this issue. According to global 
media monitoring project (GMMP) findings 2022(Global Media Monitoring Project, n.d.), 
stories by female reporters had a 36% representation and 64% representation for the 
males. In the 2022 report by the international women’s media foundation, women only 
made up 28% of journalists and media workers in Uganda(Byerly, 2011) 
This study assesses gender equality in Ugandan newsrooms, in particular, at Power FM, 
to identify barriers to, and inform strategies on how women can be assisted to improve 
their participation in journalism. surveys and interviews coupled with thematic analysis 
will be used to source the data from selected industry players. 
These are some of the factors that have contributed to gender inequality in Ugandan 
newsrooms and these include historical biases, work-life balance, stereotypes, lack of 
representation and harassment. 
Impacts of gender inequality in newsrooms. 
 Low representation of women in news coverage perpetuates a narrow range of 
perspectives and is usually reported with respect to traditional themes such as 
reproductive rights, gender-based violence, and health inequities. Much of this limited 
coverage frames the female experience from the point of view of men and perpetuates 
stereotypes that place women in only a caregiver or victim role, rather than as leaders 
and change agents(The Missing Perspectives of Women in News, n.d.). 
It not only furthers these stereotypes but also undermines the credibility of news 
organizations when women are underrepresented in editorial positions. This can create 
an impression in audiences that lack of gender diversity shows bias, thus leading to 
diminished trust and lower engagement. Moreover, gender-biased media confirms or 

3 
 
reinstates societal norms that facilitate discrimination against women, thus impeding 
social advancement(Advisory Committee on Equal Opportunities for Women and Men Opinion 
on NEW CHALLENGES FOR GENDER EQUALITY IN THE CHANGING WORLD OF WORK, n.d.).  
Thus, a toxic workplace culture can be one major reason for attrition and low morale 
in the case of female journalists, and it normally finds its roots in gender inequality. In 
addition, the lack of mentorship and professional development opportunities further 
aggravates feelings of isolation and frustration at stake for women's professional 
growth(Byerly, 2011). 
If media operations do not reflect their various audiences, it leaves large portions of 
their populations disaffiliated most particularly women and other underrepresented 
groups. It may result in a decrease in audience engagement and lost opportunities to 
portray how women contribute much to society. 
This need to correct gender inequity in newsrooms is not only a concern for the media 
industry but also for a better, more balanced, and enlightened society. It will correct 
the imbalances and lead to the enrichment of the general discourse and social equity 
by giving a greater representation to voices and viewpoints from across a wide 
spectrum(Advisory Committee on Equal Opportunities for Women and Men Opinion on NEW 
CHALLENGES FOR GENDER EQUALITY IN THE CHANGING WORLD OF WORK, n.d.). 
1.3 Problem statement  
Despite the promotion of gender equality, women remain underrepresented in 
management and other leadership levels at Power FM and in most newsrooms in Uganda. 
This perpetuates stereotypes and consequently gives little varied perspectives in the 
news. According to research got from International Women’s Media Foundation,2021, 
only 27% of the top management positions in media are held by women. They also often 
face these inequalities in opportunities, salaries and presentations. Female journalists 
are also seen to be harassed sexually in order to attain these positions in the media 
houses, lack of approval of women’s suggestions by men because they are seen as 
dominant, sexists, threats as well as lack of justice in advertising. This hinders female 
growth as well as diverse and balanced news reporting(Robertson et al., 2021).

CHAPTER TWO 
LITERATURE REVIEW 
 2.0 Introduction 
This chapter reviews the literature available on the subject of gender inequality in the 
media, along with some findings and gaps from the research. 
The Ugandan news media has a platform of sending out information, influencing and 
shaping public opinions in different ways, however gender inequality continues to thrive 
in newsrooms. As we get into the literature review, we commence on a journey to the 
existing body of research and expose the unfair representation and treatment of the 
female journalists In the Ugandan newsrooms with our most concern on Power FM. 
Barbara Kaija 2013 ‘Uganda; women near parity but still leaving newsrooms. is an 
exploration of a wider implication for journalistic integrity, diversity and raise of the 
female journalists to the top of the board. This aims to uncover the gaps, patterns and 
highlights that bring out the issue gender inequality in Ugandan newsrooms(Kaija, 
2013).  
Causes of gender inequality in newsrooms. 
An underrepresentation of women in leadership positions: Studies have shown that 
women are highly underrepresented in Ugandan newsrooms, particularly in influential 
decision-making positions. As Rosemary Amutuhaire, rightfully said, "Women occupy 
very few top management positions in media organizations." As can be seen, it is linked 
to societal attitudes that favor traditional male/female roles and place family 
responsibilities ahead of career aspirations for women. This therefore, puts them in a 
vicious cycle where their prospects for advancement are nonexistent, thus perpetuating 
gender inequality in the news media (Icaza & Schiphorst, 2018). 
Gender-Based Discrimination and Hostile Work Environment 
Along with underrepresentation, female journalists in Ugandan newsrooms often face 
gender-based discrimination and harassment, hostile work environment. As Nalwanga 
elaborates, such discrimination manifests in aspects such as unequal pay, no promotion, 

7 
 
and stereotyping. Mujjawa, 2013 opines that such toxic workplace culture does not only 
affect the morale of the women but also inhibits their professional growth and 
development. This fact is further compounded by the prevalence of sexual harassment 
in such media organizations, which makes it hard for women to prosper in their careers. 
Media Representation and Stereotyping 
Another important issue is the portrayal of women in Ugandan media. Studies have 
shown that Ugandan media all too often perpetuates gender stereotypes, thus fostering 
destructive attitudes toward women(Kasoma, 1997). The foundation of African ethics 
and professional practice of journalism. A case for society-centred media morality 
Women are usually portrayed in traditional roles, like caregivers and home keepers, 
rather than leaders or experts in their fields. With such framing of women, this tends 
to make public perceptions both narrow in scope concerning women's capacities and 
contributions, hence worse regarding entrenching sex biases within society. 
The 2023 Gender Media Monitoring Report(Project Title: Media for Gender Equality and Social 
Justice: Leaving No One Behind GENDER MEDIA MONITORING FINDINGS, 2020), compiled by 
the Uganda Media Women's Association, for example, shows that women constitute only 
a paltry 25% of news sources quoted across different media spectrums, marked by 
inequalities in gender representations. This inequality is even more pronounced in radio 
and television, where the visibility of women is even lower. The report calls for media 
houses to adopt gender-sensitive reporting as one sure way of ensuring that the voice 
of women is well represented in news coverage. 
Dealing with Gender Inequality 
Despite the challenges, however, attempts to make newsrooms in Uganda more gender-
sensitive have been made. These are, among others, training and the formulation of 
gender-sensitive policies that place a focus on the increased representation and 
participation of women in the media, as seen by WAN-IFRA (2018). Unfortunately, these 
have not quite resolved the systemic obstacles in the path of women toward this 
profession. For instance, UMWA has pointed out the importance of increased budgetary 

8 
 
allocations to gender-responsive media training and policies that enable fair newsroom 
representation. 
more so, the Constitution of Uganda guarantees equal opportunities between women 
and men in all sectors, providing for affirmative action to increase women's 
participation in development. However, these policies are inconsistently put into 
practice, and much more should be done to ensure it creates some change in the media 
landscape. 
Gender inequality is still a major problem in Ugandan newsrooms; women are 
underrepresented, discriminated against, and stereotyped. These are some of the 
challenges that need to be addressed if there is going to be any meaningful 
development toward gender equality and better female representation in the media. 
Since the media plays a major role in shaping the imagery of society, all stakeholders 
in cooperation must strive to create an enabling environment that empowers women 
and enables their voices to be heard. 
For example, a study by Amutuhaire Rosemary (2018) exploring gendered experiences 
of women working in the media industry in Uganda; a case of Uganda Broadcasting 
Corporation, notes that the media work place is gendered and prioritizes men and 
masculinity at the expense of femininity and women. And women face discrimination, 
sexual harassment and stereotypes which have been normalized. 
A study by the African Center for Media Excellence (Study Uncovers Pervasive Online 
Violence against Women Journalists in Uganda – African Centre for Media Excellence, n.d.) the 
gendered politics of journalism in Uganda found that women journalists in Uganda face 
a number of challenges, including sexism, harassment, and discrimination. The study 
also found that women journalists are often stereotyped and marginalized in the media. 
The findings of these studies suggest that gender inequality is a common issue in 
Ugandan newsrooms. This has a number of negative consequences for women 
journalists, including lower pay, fewer opportunities for advancement, discrimination 
and a hostile work environment. this also has negative effects for the news media 

9 
 
industry as a whole, as it limits the diversity of voices and perspectives represented in 
the news. 
Media as an Agent of Change 
The media can contribute to challenging stereotypes and increasing awareness of 
gender equality by providing access to a pluralistic range of opinions and portrayals. 
However, the description of women is now being stereotypical, which emphasizes 
traditional female roles (Free Press Unlimited, 2020). According to the UNESCO report 
of 2018, many studies have pointed out that the media can actually shape conventional 
attitudes and beliefs; therefore, it is a first-rate tool in promoting gender equality. To 
this end, since the media must reflect the diversity of female voices and experiences, 
it could have an important role in breaking the stereotypes and promoting inclusive 
representation. 
 Case Studies on Gender Inequality in Ugandan Media 
Previous studies on the experiences of women in Ugandan media have highlighted key 
systemic issues, such as discrimination and harassment. An annual report on violence 
and abusive treatment against journalists by the African Centre for Media Excellence in 
2019 found that challenges to career development in both electronic and print media 
faced by women in the media in Uganda include gender bias, poor working conditions, 
and lack of mentorship opportunities.  
Role of 2.4 Power FM in Representation of Gender 
Interviews with the female journalists at power FM provided insights to their experience 
at the station. This qualitative approach helped highlight the practical implications of 
the station on issues of gender inclusiveness, among others, the station's hiring policies, 
the nature of the editorial policies, and any training programs that might be offered, 
all with a view of establishing whether they are supportive or totally against this 
initiative. Further, interviews with female journalists of Power FM will help give insights 
into the challenges they meet and experiences within the organization. 

10 
 
2.1 Literature Review Summary 
The key findings of this research point to the continued existence of a gender leadership 
gap; this gap requires comprehensive strategies to support the quest for gender equality 
in media. Research has shown that media can influence the attitudes that shape society 
considerably by promoting inclusive representations. In that respect, systemic 
challenges still persist: discrimination, harassment, and little or no career-advancing 
opportunities. It is in this spirit that the present study makes a contribution to existing 
scholarship by engaging with the context of Power FM and potential solutions in moving 
further toward gender equality in Ugandan media. 
 
THEORETICAL AND CONCEPTUAL FREAME WORK. 
2.2 Introduction 
This chapter explains the relevant theory related to gender studies and representation 
Feminist Theory  
This is a theory that analyzes gender inequality and advocates for women’s rights and 
empowerment. It started in the 19th century with the first wave feminism from 1848-
1920 focusing on women voting, women’s suffrage and property rights, the second wave 
from 1960’s -1980’s expanding issues like reproductive rights, workplace equality and 
domestic violence and finally the third wave from 1990’s -present emphasizing 
intersectionality, diversity and individual experience. Sarah Pruitt march2, 2022 what 
are the four waves of feminism?(What Are the Four Waves of Feminism? | HISTORY, n.d.) 
Feminist theory is a vast and diverse area of study, which looks into social, political and 
economic structures that contribute to gender imbalances. Its central focus involves 
understanding the effects of gender on our experiences, opportunities and results. 
Newsrooms can be understood in terms of the perpetuation and maintenance of gender 
inequality using feminist theory. Sarah Pruitt march2, 2022 what are the four waves of 
feminism? 
 

11 
 
Liberal feminism may question why few women end up in newsroom leadership positions 
and demand for equal access to opportunities and resources. 
Radically feminist theories might explain how newsroom culture and structures 
entrench gender biases while advocating for fundamental changes in news production 
or consumption. 
Intersectional feminist theories would consider how gender intertwines with other 
forms of discrimination including race as well as class that result to distinct forms 
discrimination or marginalization within newsrooms. 
In addition, feminist theory helps us grasp wider social and political implications about 
gender inequities in journalism. E.g., Feminist theory may argue that media should 
increase women’s voices by avoiding femininity 
Feminist theory can also help us understand the broader social and political implications 
of gender inequality in newsrooms. For example, the underrepresentation of women's 
voices and perspectives may be considered by feminist theory to further perpetuate 
gender stereotypes and limit our understanding of the world. 
It can be further used to analyze how newsroom dynamics and structures perpetuate 
gender-based violence and harassment and thus argue for policies and practices that 
secure safety and respect. 
2.3 Conceptual framework 
The frame work will be based on different variables and these include 
Independent Variables: 
 Gender Stereotypes and Biases 
 Power Dynamics and Leadership 
 Social and Cultural Norms 
Dependent Variables: 
 Representation of Women in Newsrooms 
 Gender Diversity in Leadership Positions 

12 
 
 Gender Equality in Editorial Decision-Making 
 Inclusive and Diverse News Coverage 
 Mental and Physical Well-being of Women in Newsrooms 
Intervening Variables: 
 Education and Training 
 Mentorship and Support 
 Policy and Legislative Frameworks 
 Industry Initiatives and Programs 
 Technological Advancements and Social Media 
Moderating Variables: 
 Intersectionality and Multiple Identities 
 Global and Local Contexts 
 Cultural and Linguistic Diversity 
 Socioeconomic Status and Class 
 Age and Generational Differences 
Outcome Variables: 
 More Gender-Equal Newsrooms 
 Increased Diversity and Inclusion in News Stories 
 Improved Mental and Physical Health for Women in Newsrooms 
 Better Descriptive Representation of Women in Leadership 
 More Representative and Equitable Media Industry 
The conceptual framework is an attempt to provide a comprehensive description of how 
the mentioned variables interrelate with and contribute to the gender inequality that 
manifests in newsrooms. The research study will, therefore, try and come up with 
approaches, solutions, and strategies for making the media fraternity more equal and 
inclusive.

CHAPTER THREE  
METHODOLOGY 
3.0 Introduction 
This section shows the strategy that was used to conduct the study in order to address 
the objectives. This breaks down all the sections i.e., research design, study 
population, sampling, data collection, to mention but a few. 
This study used qualitative research approach and will briefly explain why it is more 
suitable compared to quantitative research method. It also shows how qualitative 
research delves deeper into lived experiences and uncovers underlying social dynamics 
related to gender inequality. 
3.1 Research design 
This study used qualitative data collection. This allowed the researchers to collect more 
data and get a clear understanding of gender inequality in Power FM. 
Any understanding of gender inequalities within newsrooms must be sophisticated and 
go beyond mere numbers. Quantitative research, very useful to establish the scope of 
a phenomenon, often loses the richness of lived experience. This study followed a 
qualitative research design and hence provides more of lived experiences and 
journalistic, editing, and media executive perspectives. As Gillham (2000) case study 
research methods explains, the approach went beyond these surface statistics and help 
expose deep-seated social dynamics leading to the entrenchment of gender bias in news 
outfits. The methodology for the data collection will be based on a multi-pronged 
strategy and will gather information from these different sources to arrive at an in-
depth understanding. This multifaceted approach strengthens the credibility of the 
findings and gives a full-color portrait of realities existing in the newsrooms today for 
those working there. 
3.2 Study population 
This study’s target population involves journalists, editors and media house executors 
who work in the newsroom. This includes among others, women and people from 

14 
 
marginalized groups who have either been victims of or witnessed gender inequality 
within Power FM. 
Sample, size and sampling strategy 
Our sample size was 20 people 
Purposive sampling was conducted to ensure that the participants selected for the 
research are experienced and knowledgeable about the media industry and bring out 
diverse perspectives. 
Additionally, chain sampling, where participants help recruit others, such as asking 
colleagues and peers who may be interested in participating in the study, was 
considered. 
A sample will be got from some of the journalists working in Power FM. This will be 
according to the, district, job position and years of experience 
The sample will include 
 2-3 in-depth interview participants 
 1 case study newsroom which is Power FM. 
 4-6 observation participants (newsroom staff) 
 15-20 research participants  
Point to note is that feasibility and accessibility of participants may result in sample 
size being adjusted and also change the sampling strategy. 
3.3 Data collection methods and tools 
Rich and detailed data through the use of in-depth interviews and questionnaire type 
of setting were used for the study. The sample size for this research project was 20 
participants; employees and management of Power FM. 
Questionnaire. 
A survey will be conducted physically to journalists at Power FM. The survey will take 
up to 5 minutes to complete and will ask about the demographic information. age, 

15 
 
education level, job title and years of experience, rates of gender inequality in the 
newsrooms in Uganda, impact of gender inequality in Ugandan newsrooms experiences 
of sexual harassment and challenges faced by female journalists as they balance both 
family and work. 
Interviews  
Structed interviews will be conducted with a subset that went through the survey 
sample. The interviews lasted for about an hour and tackled the factors that have led 
to gender inequality, examples of gender inequality in the Ugandan newsrooms, effects 
of gender inequality on female journalists and the media house, and identified 
recommendations on addressing gender inequality in newsrooms. 
Data collection instruments 
Interview Guide was used with open-ended questions that probed and guided the flow 
of discourse during in-depth interviews. 
Observation Protocol, Structured guideline for observing and recording behaviors, 
interactions, and setting. 
Questionnaire: A series of questions were filled by the respondents, which obtained 
self-reported data from participants. However, it is more appropriate for quantitative 
research. 
Case Study Protocol, it is a very detailed guide for studying in-depth analysis of a single 
case or very few cases. 
Documents-existing texts, like reports, policies, or memos, can contextualize 
information. 
Quality control 
 
All the methods used were standardized and pretested to ensure no mistakes and double 
attempt of the questions. This helped us to get clear and accurate information from 
those that participated. One will be taught how to answer the guide and it will close 
after correct attempt.

Research procedure 
This was cleared by the school of journalism, media and communication [Uganda 
Christian University]. 
Permission was sought from the management of Power FM, dated, before conducting 
this research. 
 Through recommendation from other people on initial contact within Power FM, 
participants have been identified and recruited. 
 In-depth interviews with male and female journalists, editors, and managers at Power 
FM.   
 The news articles were analyzed to study gender representation and stereotyping.  
 Ensured anonymity and confidentiality of participants and data. 
 Potential biases and assumptions were identified and responded to throughout the 
research process.  
Data management  
Data was stored and the information was confidential to anyone. This information was  
stored on a computer with a secured password. 
 More so, data was organized in a logical and consistent manner, using clear file names 
and titles for easy identification 
Data was backed up regularly to prevent loss or corruption. 
Use of data visualization techniques were used to communicate findings. 
A plan was developed to archive data and preservation for a long period of time. 
Data analysis 
The approach taken in analyzing data from semi-structured interviews, observations, 
and document analysis would be qualitative method. Accordingly, the thematic analysis 
will involve transcription and coding of interview data with NVivo software in 

17 
 
identifying themes regarding gender inequality, power dynamics, and representation 
for qualitative analysis, while content analysis uses a coding scheme in analyzing news 
articles for gender representation and stereotypes. The data analysis for qualitative 
data will be done in NVivo, while cleaning, organizing, and visualizing of data will be 
done using Microsoft Excel. The sequence of data analysis would involve checking for 
missing data and inconsistencies through cleaning and organization of data, content 
analysis of news articles, and the application of Excel in terms of data visualization 
through charts and graphs to show the results effectively. 
Study limitations 
There were a few problems raised during the data collection 
Low survey turn ups as the females were scared to lose their jobs if the survey licked 
to their managers 
Limited access to the necessary resources such as, findings, personnel or equipment.

52% and females 43% of the workforce. Leadership is male-
dominated. 
Broader Media Trends 
The findings at Power FM reflect a broader trend of 
underrepresentation of women in the Ugandan media 
landscape. 
Recommendations for 
Improvement 
Systemic changes suggested include regular diversity and 
inclusion training, increasing female representation in 
leadership, mentorship programs, and pay equity audits. 
Table 1: Summary of key findings 
4.1 Key findings 
 After collecting my research, I found that Power FM, exposed the seriousness of these 
issues as seen that 80% of the female participants in the research complained of gender-
based discrimination including unequal pay and limited opportunities relative to their 
male counterparts. 
Lack of mentorship and professional support in relation to career growth is another 
significant type of barrier: 70% of female journalists say they lack guidance and 
opportunities for self-improvement with One anonymous respondent saying “she rarely 
goes to the field and she is just told to read the news collected from outside”. A kind 
of compelling reason for a lack of support is a patriarchal workplace culture that 60% 
of respondents decry as unfriendly and unwelcoming. condemning the gender 
imbalance in the newsrooms. 
The other female journalists reported that in Power FM, they experienced various 
gender inequity from colleagues and the management in the form of harmful 
stereotypes, biases, and sexist attitudes, at 83-100%. One of the respondents says most 
of the times the males make the decision even when a female suggests an opinion its 
never carried up by the colleagues. The testimony of their problems is further well 
presented in the fact that females constitute only 5-7% at the leadership level in 
contrast to constituting 43% of the workers. 

20 
 
For female journalists, the work-family balance is a major problem because they 
negotiate gendered expectations and a lack of institutional support. Fear of retaliation 
also exists should male respondents speak up about discrimination and harassment, with 
60-100% of them having observed or been subjected to gender inequity. 
Demographics and Gender Inequity Estimates 
Power FM has a newsroom of 42 employees, with the majority being males at 52%. 
Females represent 43% of the workforce with 18-20 employees. 
In terms of leadership positions, males retain a strong majority with 10-12 employees 
at 24-29% against 2-3 female employees at 5-7%. 
Junior positions are slightly dominated by females, with 14-16 employees (33-38%) 
compared to 12-14 male employees (29-33%). For female respondents, it ranged from 
83-100% who said that they witnessed or personally experienced gender inequity, while 
for male respondents, the range was 60-100%. It thus becomes very clear that gender 
discrimination is such a fact of life in the newsroom, be it directed at female journalists 
or by its very nature spreading across all other work cultures. 
Broader perspective  
The findings at Power FM reflect a wider trend within media in Uganda, the general 
trend being underrepresentation and consignment of women to traditional roles in news 
coverage. The media is a mirror of society; therefore, stereotypical and gender-biased 
reporting is sustained by deep-seated imbalances within newsrooms. 
Such challenges can only be overcome through systemic changes. Among other things, 
the media houses should ensure a gender-sensitive approach, with regard to policies, 
mentorship programs, and training initiatives that create an enabling environment. By 
putting emphasis on gender equality and tackling patriarchy at its roots, it opens a level 
playing field that empowers female journalists to take their rightful role in improving 
news coverage. 
The role of media in promoting gender inequality at Power FM. 

21 
 
The media, in general, perpetuate the issues of inequities in gender primarily through 
some of the ways it chooses to pursue its objectives at Power FM. One of the most 
disturbing ways is by reinforcing stereotypical ideas and biases in their reporting and 
programming, not to mention advertising. The Power FM further aids in perpetuating 
this culture by portraying women performing roles that are traditional and turning a 
blind eye when stereotypical representations of females come to the fore, hence 
limiting opportunities for women. 
Another huge issue is that only 43% of employees within the media workforce are 
women. The result of this non-diversity in the newsroom is that stories get slanted and 
voices get amplified. Media is supposed to represent society both accurately and fairly, 
but Power FM has failed in its representation. 
Another serious issue is the objectification and sexualization of women in media 
content, which Power FM has to address. The minimization of women to their physical 
attributes and the depiction of them as sex objects promotes a culture laden with 
sexism and misogyny, thus causing harm to women both within the media industry and 
society at large. 
Another critical challenge to achieving gender equality at Power FM is the 
homogenization of female voices and perspectives in reporting, programming, and 
decision-making. The media perpetuates this further through non-inclusion of a range 
of women's voices. It works toward consolidating the idea that women's experiences 
and opinions are not as important and valuable as those of men. 
Specifically, one of the most bothersome issues in the behavior of Power FM is the way 
it builds and shapes patriarchy within its norms and values, which in turn has been 
permitting the perpetuation of gender inequality and potentially limiting social change. 
The media are strong institutions mandated to challenge systems of oppression and 
advance justice, and in this regard, Power FM appears to fail. 
The influence of the media on public opinion and cultural norms is enormous, and with 
Power FM as an institution in entrenching gender inequality, there are far-reaching 

22 
 
implications. The media can either challenge or reinforce existing power structures in 
the attitudes and beliefs that people form about women and their roles in society. 
Indeed, Power FM must account for all the different ways in which it entrenches gender 
inequality, from stereotypical imagery to women's underrepresentation in the 
workforce. Power FM can do a lot towards gender equality and social justice with 
diverse voices for challenging oppressive structures and amplifying the voices of the 
marginalized. 
Challenges faced by female journalists at Power FM. 
The status of gender inequality in the newsroom remains one of the major issues in the 
newsrooms of Uganda. Huge challenges and barriers have always pulled women 
journalists in Uganda down to success. According to a recent study at one major FM 
radio, Power FM, 80% of the female respondents showed gender discrimination against 
them in remunerations and opportunities compared to men. 
Another challenge is the lack of mentorship and support for career growth, with 70% of 
female journalists reporting that they do not receive any form of mentorship or 
professional development opportunity. Thereafter, the patriarchal workplace culture 
fuels a lack of support, described by 60% as hostile and unwelcoming, entrenching 
gender inequality and sexism. 
Female journalists at Power FM are equally at the receiving end of injurious 
stereotypes, biases, and sexist attitudes that fellow journalists and management alike 
perpetrate, with the number standing at 83-100% in experiences of one form of gender 
inequity or another. Underrepresentation of women in leadership—where females 
occupy only 5-7% of such positions against their composition of 43% of the workforce—
further underscores the challenges women face. 
Female journalists in Kenya face a double bind between work and family commitments, 
that 
is 
constantly 
challenged 
by 
gendered 
expectations 
and 
institutional 
unsupportiveness. The need for speaking out against discrimination and harassment 
brings on the fear of retaliation. In this regard, there is 60-100% testimony by male 
respondents who witnessed or experienced an act of gender inequity. 

23 
 
These findings help underscore broader research on gender imbalances in Ugandan 
media, showing that women are news subjects and sources only 28% of the time and 
authors of news stories just 19%. Deep-seated societal stereotypes and discrimination 
root the underrepresentation of women within the industry and, when they do appear, 
it is often in traditional roles as opposed to experts or authorities. 
Solutions to address gender inequality. 
Since each media organization operates with its code of ethics and cultures, Power FM 
is just like any other in front of the problems it has to face trying to achieve gender 
equality. Since the persisting issue of gender disparity would relate to workplace 
settings, there is a great need for multilevel and comprehensive approaches. Therefore, 
this essay argues that Power FM should commit itself to systemic change through regular 
trainings on diversity and inclusion, thereby creating a more diverse and inclusive work 
culture with equal understanding and responsibility among all.  
From the data analysis, it appeared that Power FM does not represent or create 
opportunities for women, thus sustaining gender-based stereotypes and biases. The 
literature review also identified regular trainings on diversity and inclusion as a 
necessary ingredient in realizing systemic change. Putting these two together yields 
that Power FM would do well to implement a diversity and inclusion initiative to break 
down gender inequality. 
Another key area for redressing gender imbalance is increasing the presence of women 
and other underrepresented groups at management and decision-making levels, as well 
as on-air. Power FM should engage itself in active recruitment and promotion of eligible 
underrepresented 
individuals, 
identifying 
clear 
targets 
and 
objectives 
for 
improvement. This would provide role models to young women who wish to pursue their 
career path in journalism and include different perspectives in the internal decision-
making process and into the products of the organization. 
Such mentorship programs will also be very instrumental in the career growth and 
professional development of women. Matching junior journalists with mentors, Power 
FM can offer mentorship that avails guidance, support systems, and networking 

24 
 
opportunities—things that many women in the industry lack. The programs must, 
therefore, be tailor-made to address the specific challenges that female journalists 
face and equip them with what they need to make a difference. 
This can also be ensured by promoting equality in pay, benefits, and opportunities for 
promotion and training. Power FM should, therefore, undertake regular pay equity 
audits and take proper measures to bridge gaps, if any, on grounds of gender. Further, 
it should also give equal opportunities for training and development to all the 
employees so that they get adequate opportunity to grow and built up their careers. 
Sexism, misogyny, and harassment can only be addressed if there is a safe and inclusive 
culture of workplace. Power FM needs to develop a clear policy and procedure for 
reporting and addressing such issues and, more importantly, making sure that all 
employees have a voice without the fear of speaking up. There are also other resources 
and support the organization has to make available to employees who have been 
harassed or discriminated against, including counseling and legal assistance if needed. 
For instance, guidelines on gender-sensitive reporting and the implementation of 
training would be important in not continuing stereotypical impressions and biases 
through the organization's content. Power FM must therefore organize training for its 
journalists on the sensitive and nuanced reporting of gender-related issues, and it must 
implement specific directives regarding the characterization of women and other 
groups in news stories and other content. 
The commitment to gender equality needs to have clear accountability mechanisms in 
place. This will establish a system for tracking progress towards the goals set by Power 
FM, holding managers and leaders accountable for their role in promoting diversity and 
inclusiveness. One such way is to relate compensation to the progress made in this line. 
This would mean that gender equality metrics are measured as achievement during 
performance reviews. 
This shall further require regular audits and assessments for progress monitoring and 
areas of improvement. Power FM should, at regular intervals, conduct employee surveys 
about their perceptions of the culture and climate of the organization and use that data 

25 
 
to inform its diversity and inclusion efforts. The organization should also, from time to 
time, look into the content auditing regarding the representation and portrayal of 
women and other marginalized groups within their news coverage and other content. 
Employee resource groups could provide an important platform for women and 
marginalized groups within Power FM to air their views and concerns. These employee 
resource groups can support employees, advise management on different issues about 
diversity and inclusion, and help shape the organization's efforts toward diversity and 
inclusion. 
Commitment from the leadership of the organization to bridge the gender gap is very 
important to implement change. Hence, the leadership team at Power FM should set 
out clear goals and objectives of improving its diversity and inclusion and communicate 
them to all employees. Leaders must also model inclusive behaviors and hold 
themselves accountable for progress. 
It can also help Power FM engage with the community and further social and cultural 
norms of change by working with organizations that are promotive of gender equality. 
It would be possible, at this level, to raise awareness about issues of gender equality 
and to facilitate positive changes in communities through local-level partnerships with 
organizations and local communities, as well as through community events. 
recommendations on how to deal with the problem of gender inequality at Power FM.

CHAPTER FIVE 
SUMMARY OF FINDINGS, CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION. 
5.0 Introduction 
This last chapter summarizes the objectives, methodology, and findings of the study. It 
also spells out conclusions and recommendations from the research toward systemic 
change if society is to strive for gender equality within media organizations, with 
specific reference to Power FM. 
5.1 Summary of findings 
The findings of this study unveil a very distressing landscape for female journalists at 
Power FM, whereby systemic gender inequality manifests in several ways that greatly 
hamper professional growth and well-being. Based on these challenges, the 
identification can be categorized into three areas: gender-based discrimination, lack 
of mentorship, and a patriarchal workplace culture. 
Gender-Based Discrimination, the responses that showed that 80 percent of the 
respondents experienced gender-based discrimination within the newsroom were 
overwhelming. The foremost forms of discrimination include equal pay and 
opportunities. Many female journalists reported that they receive lower wages 
compared to their males holding similar qualifications and years of experience. This 
compensation disparity puts them not only in a different financial position but also tags 
them with the notion that their contribution is less worthy. More often than not, they 
also reported being bypassed for promotion opportunities, training, and key 
assignments, which aggravates further the marginalization of women in the 
organization. These inequities not only result in lowered morale but indeed create a 
greater climate of disenfranchisement among females in the media. 
In addition, lack of mentorship, a major barrier to the advancement of female 
journalists at Power FM was the lack of mentorship. About 70% of the respondents 
indicated that they felt their careers were not developing well and pointed to a 
limitation in the access to mentorship programs, as well as a lack of training and 
development opportunities. Many female journalists reported that they rarely received 

27 
 
adequate practical guidance with respect to career navigation or guidance in 
developing their skills. This issue is further escalated by the lack of clear pathways for 
professional growth, thereby leaving women lost and unguided in their professional 
journeys. In the absence of mentors and training, it's unlikely for female journalists to 
rise into positions of leadership or for their work to be taken seriously, hence 
perpetuating the cycle. 
More so, patriarchal workplace culture, 60% of the respondents described a patriarchal 
workplace culture that fosters an environment rife with sexism and misogyny. This 
culture, therefore, not only perpetuates inequality between men and women but also 
makes for a hostile, unwelcoming atmosphere against female journalists. It was 
reported by many women that they felt uncomfortable or even unsafe in the work 
environment, thus paving the way for decreased job satisfaction and an increase in 
turnover rates. Stereotyping and chauvinistic attitude, as projected through various 
behaviors, truncate opportunities for career growth and professional up-scaling because 
women often move through a terrain that is far from being conducive to their success. 
Such a patriarchal culture undermines the potential for a diverse and inclusive 
newsroom, which goes a long way in delivering balanced media content that truly 
represents the public. 
5.2 Conclusion 
The findings of this study underline systemic changes that will help to attack huge 
challenges female journalists at Power FM are currently facing. For a more equal 
workplace, institute gender-sensitive policies in administration regarding pay and equal 
opportunity for all workers at the company; equip female journalists through strong 
mentorship programs and training initiatives that will help them in career growth. 
Ultimately, a more inclusive workplace culture in which sexism is actively challenged 
and gender equality advanced holds the key to long-term success for both female 
journalists and the organization at large. 
In other words, addressing the issue of gender inequality within Ugandan newsrooms, 
especially at Power FM, is not only a matter of justice but also improving the quality of 
journalism. A diverse and fair newsroom is better put to reflect the complexity of the 

28 
 
society and serve its audience fully. It is in this understanding that Power FM must take 
a step forward to break down the barriers that exist against women journalists in order 
to create a fair and representative media landscape in Uganda. This essay format 
enables an overview of all findings against the foregrounding of any essential need for 
systemic change within the context of gender inequality at Power FM. 
5.3 Recommendations. 
There are number of recommendations that have been made for addressing gender 
inequality at Power FM one of the newsrooms in Uganda. 
Demonstration of leadership commitment to gender equality by setting certain goals 
and objectives, the leadership team should under go training on gender equality and 
unconscious bias. This is to help one oversee implementations of gender equality 
initiatives. 
Raising awareness about the increased issue, the first step to addressing an issue is to 
raise awareness for thus makes people known to the issue. This can be done through 
training programs, public awareness campaigns and so much more. 
More so, developing policies to promote gender inequalities. This will help provide a 
comfortable working environment for the female journalists. Issues to be addressed 
should include low pay, sexual harassment, discrimination and unfavorable conditions. 
Furthermore, supporting female journalists as they raise through providing them with 
raising opportunities, employing more women in the different sectors. This to help 
widen the female representation on board thus creating less bias. By taking these steps 
the media news company is ready to equality in the newsrooms. 
More to that Power FM should conduct regular gender audits to monitor progress in the 
working environment for example how many women have joined the radio stations and 
how far have they gone in their career. This also helps one to identify which points need 
improvement. The findings got should be used to inform gender equality initiatives. 
Power FM should promote inclusivity at the work place through training programs and 
diversity initiatives, these programs should focus on gender equality, unconscious bias, 

29 
 
and inclusive language. Diversity initiatives should aim at increasing female 
representation in leadership position and giving women a chance to air out their views. 
 
5.4 Areas for further research. 
This study aimed at examining gender inequality in Ugandan newsrooms in relation to 
Power FM. Therefore, more research can focus on how traditional masculinity and 
gender roles contribute to gender inequality in the media industry. More so this research 
can assess the impact of organizational culture and policy on gender inequality in the 
media industry, investigate the long-term consequences of gender inequality on 
individuals, organizations and society as a whole. In additional one could focus on 
comparing gender inequality in the media industry across different countries and 
regions and the different practices and strategies for promoting gender equality in the 
media industry.
