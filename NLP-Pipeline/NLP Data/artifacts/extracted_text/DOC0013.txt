ABSTRACT 
Solanum aethiopicum Shum presents differences in germination performance with a 
relatively low germination percentage of 0-25% and this is attributed to the relative 
response of different varieties to germination conditions caused by intraspecific factors 
such as genetics. With progression of generations over seasons, seeds vary in the 
stability levels of inheritance of superior traits for germination pointing out the 
difference in levels of seed quality for efficient crop establishment and growth. This 
research evaluated seed quality of Solanum aethiopicum Shum varieties E11, E15, and 
E16 over two seasons and the effect of germination synchrony on plant growth 
performance. This was objectively to check for stability of germination of the varieties 
with progression over seasons and establish how levels of germination synchrony 
influence plant establishment and growth. 
The experiment was carried out in a screen house at Uganda Christian University, 
Mukono using a Completely Randomized Design, with three replicates for three 
varieties. Germination study was conducted in a healing chamber and germination 
metrics recorded were germination percentage, mean germination time, germination 
velocity index, and germination synchrony. Subsequent plant growth was conducted in 
a screen house and growth metrics studied were plant height, plant canopy, stem girth, 
leave dimensions, and petiole traits. 
Results of the study indicated that germination performance varied across all varieties 
over seasons with p-value 0.229 for germination percentage, p-value 2.46 for Mean 
Germination Time, p-value 0.046 for Germination Velocity Index, and p-value 0.064 for 
Germination Synchrony at significance level of 5%. Furthermore, different levels of 
germination synchrony across the varieties had marginal to significant effects on plant 
growth performance where variety E11 expressed relatively stable genetic expression 
across seasons in its germination rates followed by varieties E15 and E16. Additionally, 
different germination synchrony levels exhibited variations in all plant growth 
parameters with exception of petiole length suggesting a strong influence of

CHAPTER ONE 
1.1 Background 
Solanum aethiopicum Shum is a nutrient-rich horticultural crop belonging to the 
Solanaceae family (Buteme et al., 2021). It is also referred to as scarlet eggplant or 
garden egg, said to have originated from tropical Africa (Plaza et al., 2024) and evolved 
from Solanum anguivi (Godfrey et al., 2017). It is one of the four sub-groups of Solanum 
aethiopicum on morphological variations which include gilo, kumba, aculeatum, and 
Shum, cultivated for their leaves and fruits for consumption and ornamental purposes 
for the aculeatum group (Buteme et al., 2021). The Shum group locally known as 
‘nakati’ in Uganda is a common highly nutritious African Indigenous Vegetable, (AIV) 
cultivated for its leaves (Kabod et al., 2018). However, the vegetable has received less 
attention (Nakyewa et al., 2021), and there is limited knowledge about the crop among 
researchers (Botey et al., 2019; Han et al., 2021) and so to explore this loophole, this 
study focuses on evaluating seed quality of the African vegetable considering seed 
germination as an indicator. Seed germination is influenced by a combination of genetic 
traits and environmental conditions, essential for understanding plant adaptation, 
population dynamics, and cultivation success (Maleki et al., 2023). As shown by Ghaleb 
et al. (2022), factors such as germinability and rate can vary within seed populations 
across generations, reflecting adaptive mechanisms or selective pressures in response 
to cultivation practices and environmental shifts. This aligns with Govindaraju and 
Dancik’s (2021) findings, which highlight that stability indices in germination can differ 
significantly across developmental stages, stressing the importance of evaluating 
genetic stability over time to check for heritability levels over the seasons (Sales et al., 
2013). The African eggplant is known to have a germination period of 5-9 or even more 
days from sowing (Lozano et al., 2022) which accounts for possibility in difference of 
rates of germination with a germination percentage range of 0%-25% (Botey et al., 2021) 
indicating variation in seed quality among varieties across seasons   
Synchrony, or the uniform timing and simultaneous germination among seeds (Botey et 
al., 2021), can impact plant establishment, competition, and resilience to 
environmental stresses. Across generations and over seasons, heritability is influenced 

 
2 
 
by mendelian & non-mendelian genetics ( Achrem et al., 2023; Mittelsten Scheid, 2022; 
Strome et al., 2024)(Achrem et al., 2023; Mittelsten Scheid, 2022; Strome et al., 2024). 
However, levels of phenotypic expression vary with progression of generations due to 
effects of inbreeding depression and DNA methylation(Walter et al., 2023). To further 
contribute to the understanding of synchrony in the three cultivated species based on 
seed quality, this research will explore whether this trait remains consistent or adapts 
based on environmental and genetic influences, and the extent of this variation across 
seasons for the different varieties highlighting the potential implications for breeding, 
commercial bulking, and cultivation practices. 
As shown by Ghaleb et al. (2022), factors such as germinability and rate can vary within 
seed populations across generations, reflecting adaptive mechanisms or selective 
pressures in response to cultivation practices and environmental shifts and so the 
purpose of studying different seasons points out the stability for inheritance of 
desirable traits by the relative varieties over the seasons to identify heritability levels.      
Therefore, germination synchrony explains dormancy patterns and seed adaptation to 
the environment and it is relatively expressed over seasons due to heritable fitness 
traits that are relative to individuals and varieties (Walter et al., 2023) 
1.2 Statement of the problem 
Solanum aethiopicum Shum presents differences in seed germination days (Han et al., 
2021) over a range of five (5) or more days that is 5-9 days from sowing and a 
germination percentage range 0-25% (Botey et al., 2022) which is wide enough to 
optimize varieties with highest germinability and synchrony over seasons. Within a 
seed’s potential, germination stability indices can differ across developmental stages 
(Govindaraju & Dancik, 2021). During germination, seed adaptations to germination 
conditions in the environment differ in occurrence of processes of imbibition, enzyme 
activation, elongation of the hypocotyl, and seed coat rupture. The difference in 
germination timing categorizes the Shum plant population into early and late 
germinators depending on the timing of seedling emergence. This, subsequently affects 
overall plant fitness, health and yield of the population basing on the stability levels of 
inheritance of different varieties across generations for plant breeding programs and 

 
3 
 
bulking for commercial purposes aligning with Sustainable Development Goals 1 and 2 
(FAO, 2021) 
1.3 Objectives 
To assess Solanum aethiopicum Shum varieties most suitable for early germination and 
uniformity across generations 
1.3.1 Specific Objectives 
1. To investigate the germination rate of the three released varieties of Solanum 
aethiopicum Shum under optimum conditions across seasons (stability) 
2. To determine subsequent plant growth at different germination synchrony levels 
across the selected varieties  
1.4 Research hypotheses 
 There is a difference in levels of germination synchrony of the three released 
varieties of S.aethiopicum Shum across seasons 
 There is a difference in subsequent plant growth at different germination 
synchrony levels across the selected varieties  
1.5 Justification  
Across inbred generations over seasons, stability is obtained due to increased 
homozygosity from a reduced gene pool from inheritance of strong genetic components 
(Walter et al., 2023). This results into a consistency in the gene frequency thus genetic 
uniformity where constant alleles for desirable traits are identified, providing an insight 
into breeding practices through reliable data for seed viability and vigor, and bulking 
seed production systems for seed quality based on performance across seasons (Kebede 
et al., 2016). According to Gramazio et al., 2017, enhancing the seed system for scarlet 
eggplant aligns with the global efforts through the Sustainable Development Goals, 
(SDG) to develop climate- smart and resilient vegetable varieties. Through this study, 
researchers can determine the extent to which synchrony is maintained over planting 
seasons, suggesting a strong genetic relative for the three varieties.  Uniformity in the 
seed bank also facilitates agronomic efficiency through its direct impact on planting 
density, plant competition, and overall crop yield facilitated by uniform growth and 

 
4 
 
better nutrient uptake. Uniform crop establishment and maturity, makes cultivation 
less difficult for the local farmers in terms of management to obtain consistent, reliable 
crop production, and steady income generation (Bewley & Bradford, 1994). 
1.6 Significance  
With rising global concerns about climate variability, seed quality evaluation through 
germination synchrony is a selectively adaptive trait which stabilizes crop 
establishment under variable climatic conditions (Merrick et al., 2020). This is 
especially relevant to the Sub- Saharan countries with unpredictable rains and 
temperature shifts. By analyzing the traits in the different varieties for seed quality, 
genetic diversity within the species is evaluated, providing ground for future breeding 
efforts to strengthen nutrition and food security (Grubben and Denton, 2004). 
Evaluating seed quality traits of different Shum varieties especially germination 
synchrony, to be utilized by commercial producers for bulking reduces cases of 
replanting and excessive seed usage which contributes to resource efficiency and 
minimizes agricultural wastage thus aligning with sustainable agriculture goals that 
emphasize responsible use of inputs to protect environmental resources without 
compromising long- term productivity (Bradford et al., 2017). Identifying seed quality 
stability traits of Solanum aethiopicum Shum also holds importance in achieving uniform 
seedling emergence and establishment thereby enhancing agronomic efficiency by 
optimizing agricultural productivity and obtaining consistent yields especially in 
resource-constrained farming systems (Bradford et al., 2017).

CHAPTER TWO  
2.0 Literature review  
2.1 Taxonomy of Solanum aethiopicum Shum 
Solanum aethiopicum is a leafy vegetable that evolved from the wild Solanum anguivi, 
with the taxonomic classification of kingdom Plantae, Phylum Tracheophyta, Class 
Magnoliopsida, Order Solanales, Family Solanaceae, Genus Solanum, and Species 
aethiopicum. Shum is one of the four sub- groups of S. aethiopicum alongside other 
groups of gilo, kumba, and aculetum (Jäger et al., 2023)  
2.2 Botany and agronomy of S. aethipicum Shum 
It is often grown as an annual crop, with its leaves being harvested for 2 or more 
seasons. However, it is a perennial plant with more or less woody and much branched 
stems. Its propagation is by seed, with germination taking averagely 5- 9 days (Botey 
et al., 2022) and transplanting of seedlings to the field is done 30- 35 days from the day 
of sowing when plants have attained a height of 15- 20cm with 5- 7 leaves. Seedlings 
grow at a fast rate and flowering starts at 40- 100 days from sowing and first flowers 
are concurrently initiated with branching and the production of younger leaves (Prakash 
& Sharma, 2017; Bragard et al., 2021).  
It can be cultivated in home gardens and grown commercially for sale in local markets. 
With a growing season of at least three months, the plant does best in areas with annual 
day time temperatures ranging between 20- 30⁰C and a mean annual rainfall of 
1200mm- 1600mm but tolerant to lower amounts of 800mm. Moderately fertile, well- 
drained soils that are exposed to sunlight are best for the plant with PH range of 5.5- 7 
is best, while ensuring moderate nitrogen levels to optimize leaf yield. Where irrigation 
is involved, yield ranges between 12- 20t/ha with improved cultivars yielding 50- 80t/ha 
under favorable conditions. Shum cultivars under good management produce up to 75 
leaf bundles of 30kg each implying a yield potential of 225t/ha (Buteme et al., 2021). 
This enables for optimization of varieties with highest seed quality in terms of 
germination timing, percentage, and synchrony to achieve that yield potential.                  
( Bragard et al., 2021)

2.3 Challenges facing production of S.aethiopicum Shum 
Globally, production of Shum is faced with a challenge of heterogeneity of phenotypic 
responses, which explains the lack of stability, as it interferes with uniform plant 
response to water stress and it is one of the major challenges to Shum productivity   
(Tumuhimbise et al., 2022). This affects responses such as the reduction in leaf 
elongation and impacts stomatal closure, thereby reducing the nutrient value of 
stressed plants and lowering their market value (Gabriel, 2013; Kiwuka et al., 2020) 
Africa is experiencing climate variations where the normal dry and wet seasons are 
currently shifting to being wetter and hotter than before, posing challenges to plant 
resilience to water loss (Mubiru et al., 2018). This has created a gap that causes yield 
losses, hence prompting the need for optimization of well-performing Shum varieties 
with early, rapid, and synchronized germination to improve field management practices 
uniformly across all established plants (Bragard et al., 2021). Locally, in Uganda, 
farmers and gender-based preferences for Nakati varieties vary depending on the yield 
experienced in the major Nakati-growing districts, namely Mukono, Wakiso, and 
Luweero (Nakyewa et al., 2021) The identification of the variety with the highest 
synchrony has been shown to produce more yield compared to others, contributing to 
the livelihoods of an estimated 400,000 people in Uganda (Nakyewa et al., 
2021;Nsubuga et al., 2014). Nonetheless, erratic germination behavior and poor 
seedling establishment are also common challenges faced by farmers, often due to 
reliance on saved and recycled seeds (Botey et al., 2019, 2021). These issues highlight 
the importance of understanding seed germination dynamics and developing varieties 
with desirable germination traits like synchronization.  
2.4 Importance of seed quality  
Seed quality, as a vital aspect of successful crop production, includes physiological 
aspects such as germination capacity, vigor, viability, and physical aspects of purity and 
health (ElMary et al., 2019; Turner et al., 2020). The seed quality assessment is vital 
for high yield potential as well as encouraging effective seed usage in agricultural 
systems (Dias et al., 2023). Additionally, seed health as part of seed quality is significant 
for vigor longevity, and its ability to minimize diseases that could arise during 

 
7 
 
propagation (Saldanha et al., 2020) and various germination tests can be conducted 
alongside other technological advancements to evaluate seed quality so as to maintain 
seed integrity throughout the production and storage cycles (Rego et al., 2020; 
Sundareswaran et al., 2023)   
2.5 Germination behavior over seasons 
As germination stability ensures the predictability of germination traits across different 
planting cycles, it is influenced by genetic and environmental factors. Studies have 
revealed various key insights such as intra-varietal variability where research shows 
that S. aethiopicum exhibits genetic diversity affecting germination rates (Buteme et 
al., 2021). Differences in floral and phenological traits among varieties contribute to 
variability in seed vigor and synchrony.  
While there is a lack of specific research on the germination rate and stability of S. 
aethiopicum Shum varieties across generations, studies on related Solanum species 
provide valuable insights (Botey et al., 2021). Physiological dormancy, observed in 
Solanum melongena and Solanum torvum, can also contribute to low germination 
percentages (Botey et al., 2017) and this may be influenced by the maturity stage of 
the fruit at harvest and the extraction process (Botey et al., 2017). Genetic factors 
such as seed size and the rate and duration of seed filling, can impact the accumulation 
of food reserves within the seed, (Silva et al., 2015; Santos et al., 2020; Botey, 2022) 
which in turn, influences germination and initial seedling growth.  
2.6 Impact of germination timing on growth 
The timing of germination plays a pivotal role in determining early-stage plant vigor 
and overall development in factors like competition for resources to impact seedling 
survival and growth (Sales et al.,2013). Related studies reveal that early germinating 
seeds of Solanaceae, including S. melongena, outperformed late germination in plant 
fitness such as root and shoot development (Margenot et al., 2016; Verdu, M., Travest, 
A., 2005). Similar effects were observed in S. aethiopicum, where early germinators 
had higher biomass accumulation. Physiologically, early germination positively 
impacted nutrient absorption and stress resilience, especially under optimized 

 
8 
 
fertilization regimes (Margenot et al., 2016). As per crop establishment, early and 
uniform germination ensured synchronized growth phases, reducing competition for 
resources (Buteme et al., 2021). While maintaining all environmental factors constant 
in a screen house, the study aims to evaluate germination characteristics across seasons 
for the three varieties so as to identify the variety with superior genetic strength of 
desirable traits of early and synchronous germination for positive impact on subsequent 
growth and potentially higher- yielding plants.

CHAPTER THREE 
3.0 METHODOLOGY 
3.1 Methodology 1 
Evaluating germination rates in Solanum aethiopicum Shum 
3.1.1 Area of study  
The germination studies were conducted in the screen house at Uganda Christian 
University in Mukono district, located in the central part of Uganda approximately 27km 
East of Kampala. It lies at an altitude of 1158-1219m above sea level. The district 
receives two wet seasons with an annual rainfall ranging between 1100 and 1400mm. 
Temperatures experienced range between 21⁰C and 29⁰C with coordinates 00⁰20’N 
32⁰45’E. This experiment ran from January 2024 to March 2025 with day screen house 
temperatures ranging between 18⁰C to 42⁰C 
3.1.2 Study material  
Seeds for the three released varieties of Solanum aethiopicum Shum, 148 (E11), 137 
(E15) & 184 (E16) were used. These were obtained from the faculty of Agricultural 
Sciences seed bank, and seeds used were selfed- seeds (hybrids). Variety E11 is 
characterized with green stems, green leaves and leaf veins with generally whole leaf 
margins, variety E15 has green- purple stems, green leaf veins, and moderately serrated 
leaf margins, and E16 is purple stemmed, has green leaves with purple-green leaf veins, 
and has serrated leaf margins 
3.1.3 Experimental Design 
Using Complete Randomized Design, (CRD), 100 seeds for each variety  were planted in 
planting trays with 3 replicates for each variety for the germination study (Steel & 
Torrie, 1980), ensuring sufficient sample size for statistical analysis(Ranal & De Santana, 
2006). Each replicate was tagged and labeled with information about the variety, date 
of planting, and replicate number. The substrate used was steam-sterilized soil mixed 
with well-decomposed poultry manure in a ratio of 3:1 for the S. aethiopicum Shum 
seeds. The experiment was conducted in a healing chamber with controlled 

 
10 
 
temperature and light conditions with average 20-45% humidity and 20-49⁰C 
temperature as per guidelines for germination studies (Analysts & Seed, 2014)  
3.1.4 Data collection 
Visual observation for emergence of seedlings above the soil that is, the plumule or 
hypocotyl was considered to record for germination. Germination was monitored at an 
interval of every 24 hours (daily) and the number of germinated seeds at each 
observation time in the seed bed was recorded in a physical data sheet and later 
entered into Microsoft excel for accuracy (Finch-savage & Leubner-metzger, 2006).  
The independent variables were the Shum varieties (148, 137, & 184) and the season 
while the dependent variables were the germination characteristics in terms of speed 
and overall number of germinated seeds among the total number sown. The control 
variables were the germination conditions as temperature, moisture, and light, and the 
mediating variables were the germination physiological processes as imbibition, 
activation of hormones, and elongation of the hypocotyl coupled with seed coat rupture 
(Bewley et al 2013) 
3.1.5 Data Analysis 
The germination rate was calculated in terms of final germination percentage, 
germination velocity index, GVI and mean germination time, GMT for each variety and 
season. This followed established formulae for germination assessment (Scott et al., 
1984) 
Germination percentage=

, Where T is the mean germination time, Ti is the time from the start 
of the experiment to the ith interval, Ni is the number of seeds germinated in the ith 
time interval (not accumulated), and k is the total number of time intervals. Statistical 
analysis was conducted using Analysis of Variance, ANOVA, t-tests to compare 
germination rates and synchrony among varieties and generations (Gomez & Wiley, 
1984). ANOVA tests were conducted to analyze the data so as to determine if there 
were significant differences in germination rates among the African eggplant varieties 
and generations.

3.2.1 Layout 
Loam soil was mixed with well decomposed poultry manure in a ratio of 3:1 and 
sterilized using steam, as the substrate. Well steam sterilized soil was then packed in 
polypots weighing 10kg per pot using a weighing scale and the pots were arranged in 
the screenhouse using a block design of 15 pots per block with three replicates. After a 
week of allowing the soil to cool and watering in preparation for planting, 15 seedlings 
for each variety were transplanted into well tagged pots. Tags carried information about 
the variety, replicate, and date of transplanting. Spacing within sub plots was 45cm by 
15cm for 15 plants per plot, and 45cm between plots of replicates. Agronomic practices 
such as regular watering, weeding, fertilizer application, and pest and disease control 
were carried out, while controlled light, humidity, and temperature conditions were 
monitored in the screen house (AOSA, 1993)

3.2.3 Data collection 
From fifteen (15) seedlings transplanted, ten (10) plants were randomly selected for 
data collection on the growth parameters, ensuring unbiased sampling (Steel & Torries, 
1980). Selected 10 plants were tagged using threads of different colors and data was 
collected once every week on 10 plants using materials such as rulers, Vanier calipers, 
pencils and hard copy data sheets. Data was collected on parameters such as plant 
height, plant canopy, stem girth, number of leaves, leaf length, and leaf width as 
standard indicators of plant growth and health (Ranal & De Santana, 2006) 
The independent variables were germination synchrony levels, Shum varieties (148, 138 
& 184), and the seasons (1 & 2). The dependent variables were the subsequent plant 
growth metrics as plant height, plant canopy, stem girth, number of leaves, leaf length, 
leaf width, biomass analysis of fresh weight and dry weight. The control variables were 
the germination conditions as temperature, moisture, and light, and the mediating 
variables were the germination physiological processes as imbibition, activation of 
hormones, and hypocotyl elongation coupled with seed coat rupture (Bewley et Al 2013) 
3.2.4 Data analysis 
Statistical data analysis was by conducting ANOVA and t-tests to compare growth 
parameters between levels of germination synchrony of each variety and season, as 
appropriate tools for examining variance and significance in plant studies (Gomez & 
Wiley, 1984). Analyzed data was used to determine if germination synchrony provided 
a significant advantage for subsequent growth in S. aethiopicum and the implications 
of the findings were discussed for plant breeders, commercial producers, and farmers, 
emphasizing the importance of selecting varieties with high germination synchrony and 
early germination rates.

CHAPTER 4  
This chapter comprises of results of the study and their interpretation for germination 
tests and the subsequent plant growth influenced by germination synchrony. Four 
parameters were examined for germination performance for three varieties (E11, E15, 
AND E16) across 2 seasons. Data analysis conducted presented differences in interaction 
between seasons and varieties for each germination test and six parameters were 
assessed for subsequent plant growth.  
4.1 Germination percentage 
The proportion of seeds that successfully germinate under favorable conditions, usually 
expressed in percentage is the germination percentage. The data in the table shows 
germination percentages for the three varieties, E11, E15, and E16 tested in two 
different seasons, 1 and 2 with their Least Significant Difference, LSD groups that is, 
“a”, “b”, and “c” to illustrate the significant difference between groups. Germination 
percentage groups with similar LSD groups show no significant difference while 
differences in LSD groups indicate significant differences in the germination 
percentage. Season and genotype both demonstrated significant effects with no 
significant interaction between them at p<0.05. Variety E11 consistently showed higher 
germination percentage across both seasons with a higher increase in season 2 (87.7%). 
Varieties E11 and E15 performed with more moderate germination percentages, with 
E15 performing better in season 2 and both showing lowest values in season 1.

4.2 Mean germination time 
The average time, usually in days, taken for seeds to germinate is the mean germination 
time. Lower mean germination time values reflect faster speed and uniformity of 
germination as opposed to higher values of mean germination time. Faster germination 
is desirable in subsequent crop establishment and growth. There was no significant 
difference in interaction between season and genotype for Mean Germination Time. 
Variety E11 in season 1 had the longest germination time (8.41 days), indicating slowest 
germination. However, Variety E15 had consistently fast germination across both 
seasons (7.34- 7.36 days), indicating greater stability in germination traits across 
seasons

4.3 Germination velocity index 
Germination velocity index, GVI measures how quickly and vigorously seeds germinate 
over time where higher GVI values indicate a faster and more uniform germination 
providing a useful insight of seed vigor and quality to select high performing varieties 
across seasons over less performing varieties for farming and breeding purposes of 
superior traits. There was significant difference in interaction between season and 
variety at p<0.05 with p-value for the variety×Season of 0.0046. Variety E11 
demonstrated differences between seasons with a low velocity in season 1 and high 
velocity in season 2. E15 had a consistently high germination velocity index in both 
seasons, indicating a more stable germination performance across seasons

4.4 Germination synchrony 
The simultaneous germination or the degree to which seeds in a lot germinate at the 
same time reflecting uniformity, is referred to as germination synchrony derived from 

 
18 
 
the calculation for coefficient of germination. Higher synchrony values mean that more 
seeds in the lot germinate more uniformly, which is often preferred for even seedling 
growth while lower synchrony values translate scattered and irregular germination 
timing. Germination synchrony values range from 0 to 1, with 1 illustrating perfect 
synchrony of all seeds germinating together. There was a significant difference in 
interaction between variety and season. Season 2 had higher synchrony values across 
all varieties, illustrating more uniform germination. E15 in season 2 achieved the 
highest synchrony (0.177), while all varieties in season 1 showed lower synchrony 
values. At p-value of 0.0635, there was a significant interaction between season and 
variety to the effect of germination synchrony level

OBJECTIVE 2  
4.5 Plant growth performance by variety and germination synchrony level 
The length at which a plant grows, usually measured in centimeters can be influenced 
by its genotype that is, variety and its early- stage vigor following the level of uniform 
germination. Taller plants indicate better seedling vigor and growth which offer 
competitive advantage in the crop population. The data in the table and graph present 
the relationships between the Shum varieties E11, E15, and E16 and germination 
synchrony levels with the effect on plant height, and a graphical representation to 
visualize plant height by variety and germination. Plant canopy refers to the above 
ground spread of the plant by measuring the diameter. Larger canopies indicate better 
vegetative growth with more leaf area thus a higher photosynthetic capacity beneficial 
for growth performance. Canopy development can be influenced by the variety (genetic 
potential) and germination vigor and uniformity which influence early growth. Variety 
E11 was observed to have the widest canopy at synchrony of 0.14 followed by E15 at 
synchrony of 0.15. E16 with the highest synchrony of 0.15 had the smallest canopy 

 
20 
 
suggesting that while synchrony is beneficial, other factors such as genetics contribute 
to canopy development as moderate synchrony levels had optimal canopy formation  
The thickness of a plant’s main stem is the stem girth serving as an indicator of 
structural strength, nutrient transport capacity of the plant, and overall plant 
robustness. Thicker stems can support better plant performance by nutrient flow and 
withstanding environmental stresses as compared to thinner plant stems. Variety E15 
produced the thickest stems at synchrony level of 0.14 suggesting better vegetative 
growth with significance difference. E16 demonstrated thinner stems under low 
synchrony levels, compromising stability levels while E11 produced plants with thin 
stems under 0.14 germination synchrony. The number of leaves of a plant indicates the 
vegetative growth of the plant. A larger number of leaves generally indicates higher 
photosynthetic capacity supporting better plant growth performance as compared to 
plants with fewer leaves. Germination synchrony affects leaf development through 
early seedlings and the genetic potential of the plant. Variety E15 produced the highest 
number of leaves followed closely by E16 and E11 had the lowest leaf count despite 
leading in plant height and canopy size 
Leaf length is the measurement from the base of the leaf at attachment with the petiole 
to the tip of the leaf. It reflects a plant’s growth and elongation capacity which presents 
the photosynthetic capacity for better energy production and growth. Germination 
synchrony affects leaf elongation alongside the genetics of the plant varieties. The 
measurement across the broadest part of the leaf is the leaf width and it presents a 
surface for photosynthetic activity of the plant. Broader leaves capture more sunlight 
implying higher photosynthesis rates for biomass production and growth. Unlike on 
mature leaves, germination synchrony may affect early leaf development though the 
effects of leaf width may be variety-dependent. For the result on leaf dimensions, 
variety E11 produced the longest and widest leaves, providing strong photosynthetic 
potential under moderate synchrony conditions of 0.14. Both E15 and E16 had shorter 
and narrower leaves at high and low synchrony of 0.13 and 0.15. 

 
21 
 
The petiole length is the measurement of the stalk that attaches the leaf blade to the 
plant stem before branching at the seedling stage. It influences the positioning of the 
leaf to capture light for photosynthetic efficiency and airflow around the leaves for 
respiration. Aside from how uniformly seeds germinate, germination synchrony may 
indirectly affect petiole growth through its effect on early seedling development. No 
significant differences were observed in the petiole length across all varieties, 
suggesting that germination synchrony has minimal impact on this trait.

CHAPTER 5 
This chapter presents the discussions for the interpreted data from chapter 4 in relation 
to other studies on seed quality, its effect on germination traits, and plant growth 
performance. The discussions compare and contrast the results firstly with the aim of 
identifying Solanum aethiopicum Shum varieties with stronger germination traits across 
seasons and secondly to identify desirable traits of growth performance in relation to 
early and uniform germination that is, germination synchrony  
5.1 Discussion for objective 1 
Evaluation germination rates for the three released varieties of S.aethiopicum Shum 
The results from the interpretation reveal that both season and genotype had significant 
influence on germination characteristics that is germination percentage, mean 
germination time (GMT), germination velocity index (GVI), and germination synchrony. 
The season had high significant effect on all four germination characteristics indicating 
how they strongly impact germination performance. The variety affected germination 
performance implying that genetic differences among the genotypes contributed to 
variations in germination performance. However, there was significant impact on the 
interaction between season and genotype slightly for germination synchrony, strongly 
suggesting that the effect of season on germination traits varied depending on the 
variety. In germination percentage, the study significant variation was identified among 
the varieties, with E11 demonstrating higher germination performance in season 2, 
indicating its potential as favorable variety across multiple growing seasons. This result 
agrees with findings that highlight genetic variability as a factor in germination 
efficiency, where certain varieties outperform others in specific environmental 
conditions (Adebisi et al., 2013; Jahan et al., 2018). The interaction between season 
and genotype for germination percentage suggests that while both factors are critical 
for successful germination, they operate independently in influencing germination 
percentage relating with studies supporting independent contributions of variety and 
season to germination outcomes (Khodarahmpour, 2011; Lamichhane et al., 2021). 

 
27 
 
Results from mean germination time demonstrated significant variation influenced by 
both season and genotype, with the interaction effects suggesting that some genotypes 
particularly respond to changes over seasons. The shortest germination times recorded 
for variety E15 in season 1 and E15 in season 2 indicate a strong relationship between 
genetics and environmental adaptability, resonating with findings that agrees certain 
varieties exhibit greater plasticity in response to environmental factors (Sheng et al., 
2021). This study’s finding suggests that breeding programs might benefit from focusing 
on varieties with genotypes that adapt well to environmental variations other than high 
germination performance 
Germination velocity index results support the interaction between genetic potential 
and environmental influence, as highest GVI values in varieties E11 for season 2 and E15 
season 2 display their capability for rapid establishment under optimal growth 
conditions. Studies by Shezi & Adjetey, 2020 correlate GVI with overall plant vigor and 
successful crop establishment and so, the significant interaction between season and 
genotype observed in the study emphasizes the importance of selecting high GVI 
varieties while also emphasizing how these varieties respond to varying seasonal 
changes. Germination synchrony was significantly affected by both season (p>0.001) 
and variety (p=0.0241) although the minimal significance of the interaction (p=0.0635) 
indicates that while synchrony generally varies with seasons, response to environmental 
pressures might vary with varieties. This aligns with findings of Shu et al., 2017; Souza 
et al., 2013 which emphasizes the importance of synchrony for agriculture pointing out 
uniform germination that can lead to better crop management and yield frequency  
5.2 Discussion for objective 2 
Comparing effects of germination synchrony on crop growth in S. aethiopicum Shum 
From the data analyzed, plant growth metrics are related to variety and germination 
synchrony influencing parameters and the study reveals that variety had a predominant 
effect on growth characteristics while germination synchrony had minimal influence. 
This finding matches with the general understanding that genetic variability as in the 

 
28 
 
different Shum varieties offers a more significant impact on plant growth than timing 
and uniformity of germination. 
At a significant effect of variety on plant height, (p<0.005), the result aligns with 
research that emphasizes the role of genetic factors in determining growth traits. Zhao 
et al argue out that leaf and plant morphology may be closely linked to genetic 
predispositions and so they often express variability depending on genetic background  
(Zhao et al., 2018). In this case, the superior height observed in variety E11 as compared 
to E15 and E16 illustrates how specific genetic traits can lead to enhanced growth 
performance. For plant canopy growth, E11 and E16 produced superior canopy size 
significantly different from E11 (p=0.50). This result supports the assertions made by 
Diouf et al., who confirmed significant variability among varieties concerning 
vegetative traits including plant canopy (Diouf et al., 2017) 
With stem grith, germination synchrony had a significantly different relation at p=0.004. 
This observation suggests that synchronized germination positively affects stem 
robustness, essential for structural support for the plant and as well contrasts with the 
study which emphasized that plant morphological traits maybe moderated against 
environment variability (Rixen et al., 2022). This illustrates the interactions between 
environmental timing and genetic expression of traits. Leaf morphological traits that is 
number, length, and width showed a significance (p<0.005). The highest leaf count in 
E15, E16, and E11 respectively confirm that genetic factors greatly govern leaf 
attributes ( Farooq et al. 2010) and the role of leaf dimensions in shaping plant success 
is widely supported to correlate leaf traits and overall growth efficiency ( Falster et 
al., 2018; Chen et al., 2021) 
Petiole traits that is length and color, presented lack of significance influence neither 
by variety nor germination synchrony at p=0.176 and p=0.5778. this result suggests 
inherent stability in these traits under varying conditions, aligning with interpretations 
from Macklin et al., 2022 regarding consistency of leaf trait (Macklin et al., 2022)   
Meanwhile, the significant difference observed in petiole color at p<0.005 proves that

certain traits remain strongly influenced by genetic factors other than germination 
timing 
 
CHAPTER 6 
6.0 CONCLUSIONS 
This study investigated the germination rate of the three released varieties of Solanum 
aethiopicum Shum under optimum conditions across seasons (stability) and was guided 
by the hypothesis that there was difference in levels of germination synchrony of the 
three released varieties of S.aethiopicum Shum across seasons. Thereby at p> 0.005, 
with p-value 0.0635, the study confirmed significant difference in germination 
synchrony among all varieties across seasons, resulting into failure to reject hypothesis 
1 where the findings of the research show that E11 was the most stable variety across 
both seasons with high germination percentages, short germination times, and strong 
germination velocity. E15 produced a slight variability with slightly lower stability across 
both seasons and E16 demonstrated the highest variation across both seasons, 
suggesting lowest adaptability and stability 
To determine subsequent plant growth at different germination synchrony levels across 
the selected varieties, the objective was hypothesized that there was difference in the 
effects of germination synchrony on subsequent growth across the selected varieties. 
Moreover, the study also confirmed significant differences in subsequent growth 
parameters at the various germination synchrony levels across the selected varieties 
thus failure to reject hypothesis 2. This is illustrated by the results which indicated that 
germination synchrony subsequently affects plant establishment but plant growth is 
more influenced by germination velocity index other than uniformity of germination 
6.1 Recommendations 
Further research by plant breeders to identify superior traits of stability levels in variety 
E11 as it exhibited better germination and growth performance over the seasons, to 
improve the genetic potential of other varieties. Additionally, optimization of 
cultivation of varieties E11 and E15 by farmers for stable yields over seasons
