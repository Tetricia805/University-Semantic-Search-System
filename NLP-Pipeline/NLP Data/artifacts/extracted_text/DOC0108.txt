                                                ABSTRACT 
Unfired Earth bricks are widely used in construction especially in the lower income 
areas of the world.  However, unfired brickwork is less strong than blockwork or fired 
clay masonry, and at the moment its use is not advised for thin-walled earth masonry 
in high-load structural applications. Unfired earth bricks also do not carry as great a 
load from fixings. 
With that in mind, this research banks on the knowledge of soil properties to design 
appropriate geotechnical and geological investigations into the search for the most 
suitable material for earth construction. From the research below, conversely, the 
addition of 8% steel fibres from waste tyres by weight in earthen construction will 
enhance ductility, tensile strength, erosion resistance, and dimensional stability, while 
reducing shrinkage cracking in the materials.

CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION 
1.1  BACKGROUND 
The usage of unfired earth bricks was noticed in construction even in ancient 
civilizations of Egypt, Mesopotamia, and the Americas where they were prepared by 
mixing sand, clay, straw, and water in the shape of bricks and sundrying them. These 
materials were locally obtained and in plenty making them easily available to early 
builders. The earth's thermal properties also provided a natural insulation (Burnett L, 
2020).  
Europeans used much of the adobe construction in the Middle Ages, especially Portugal 
and Spain, while the art of construction made its way to Latin America after 
colonization. Over time, various cultures modified the use of this basic technique to fit 
environmental conditions. In the United States Southwest region, for instance, the 
Pueblo community built large structures by using adobe bricks (Hassan M, 2022). During 
this time, there has been revival of interest in using unfired bricks basically due to their 
sustainability-from-firing practices as they cause minimum carbon footprints compared 
with fired bricks, and they can also help regulate indoor temperatures.  
Modernization has put the qualities of unfired earth bricks into diverse uses even in the 
present-day architecture. This has given rise to emerging techniques that harness their 
durability and structural integrity. Stabilized clay with lime or cement is among the 
new-fashioned ways. 

2 
 
The adoption of unfired clay brick has been reported as one of the alternatives of 
reducing energy consumption. This interest in keeping strength requirements up for 
unfired clay bricks is currently on the increase in demand. Among the materials under 
testing for compressive strength are bricks.  
Compressive strength remains the essential parameter to be considered in the design 
of bricks. The loads acting on bricks in service are compressive in nature; their 
reliability in resisting such loads without failure is hereby considered. Thus, the quality 
of bricks depends on their compressive strength.  
 Conversely, unfired brickwork has lower embodied energy when compared to 
blockwork or fired clay masonry, while also being easier to recycle and dispose of at 
end of use. Unlike blockwork or fired clay masonry, unfired brickwork is susceptible to 
moisture penetration, so detail design must ensure it remains dry during and after 
construction. 
Over the past 10 years, rapid population growth and changes in land usage have 
increased demand and the number of vehicles on the road, thus increasing tire waste. 
Tires pollute the environment. An estimated one billion tires are discarded across the 
world every year. The materials are slow in natural degradation, and labor-intensive to 
reclaim, thus tire recycling is viewed as a sustainable solution.  
Steel fibres can be up to 15 percent of the weight of tire crumbs with corresponding 
mechanical properties similar to that of industrial fibres. Unfired earth blocks are also 

3 
 
a potential low-cost building alternative considering their low energy consumption in 
the burning process and transportation of materials.  
From [Sukontasukul et al ,2019], The use of steel fibers was found to enhance the 
flexural action of soil materials. Tajdin et al. used three fiber types, jute, steel, and 
polypropylene, in reinforcing soil materials, and results indicated improvements in 
compressive, tensile, and flexural strength. 
Generally, unfired brickwork is less strong than blockwork or fired clay masonry, and 
at the moment its use is not advised for thin-walled earth masonry in high-load 
structural applications. Fired bricks also will not carry as great a load from fixings. 
Hence, knowledge of soil properties might be of importance towards the designs of 
appropriate geotechnical and geological investigations into the search for the most 
suitable material for earth construction [Da Silva. S, 2021]. 
To counteract the above harmful effects, the soil can be stabilized. Stabilization 
improves the characteristics of the soil resulting in masonry units capable of carrying 
greater loading and better performing when subjected to natural degrading elements. 
There are several types of stabilization: the first is mechanical stabilization, the second 
is physical stabilization, and the third is chemical stabilization [Younsi Z, 2023]. 
Examination of deeper scientific results led to the conclusion that steel fibers act in 
the manner of springs by helping the masonry unit absorb a vast deal of plastic energy. 
[Babu and Vasudevan, 2021] investigated shear strength of coconut fiber reinforced soil 

4 
 
stating that culms when randomly mixed with soil improves shear strength. Fibers 
improve the pull between the soil particles while interaction of the fibers among 
themselves and flexibility of the fibers due to their behavior will be like a structural 
mesh that will hold the soil together. This gives strong integrity to the soil structure for 
absorbing huge plastic energy resisting high deformation without disintegration 
completely.  
Unfired earth bricks have always remained very much relevant over time simply due to 
their practicality and environmental benefits. Even today, they are still a very 
important material in sustainable building practices as they demonstrate a truly close 
bond with local resources and traditional craftsmanship. 
Earth bricks are of very low cost, energy efficient (they have excellent thermal 
properties, and very low energy needed to produce), ecological and safe . These 
characteristics are very relevant and important with the growing need to bring 
awareness of reduced consumption of energy across the world. However, earth 
construction techniques like wattle-dab, cob, and adobe need continuous maintenance 
for holding them in good condition. Their major limitations include water penetration, 
wall erosion at lower parts due to splashes of water from ground surfaces, damage from 
termites and pests, and need for high maintenance requirements, among others 
(Obinwanne Ugwuishiwu et al., 2018). 
For nearly a decade now, scientific research has been attempted in the area of usage 
of recycled industrial tire materials to enhance the properties of concrete , such as the 

5 
 
use of ground rubber from tire in bitumen for road constructions . Some researchers 
have focused on the results of these studies on possible uses of recycled steel fibers. 
Several scientific investigations proved that using recycled steel fibers in concrete 
would enhance the brittle matrix, toughness, and post-cracking response of concrete 
for structural applications . Adding tyre steel fibers 0.13%–0.46% by volume retained 
the strength to flexure of concrete but did not change the compressive strength for the 
same concrete mixes (Senesavath et al., 2022). 
1.2  PROBLEM STATEMENT 
 The use of earth as a building material has been commonplace for many years, 
Historically, earth has been used for construction purposes for approximately 9000 years 
and continues to be a commonly used building material especially in the rural areas of 
Uganda [Shantanu. P, 2022]. 
Bugonya village in eastern Uganda receives a lot of rainfall due to its location in the 
tropical rainforests area. This has led to bricks made of unfired earth in this area being 
prone to deterioration when exposed to adverse weather conditions like this torrential 
rain [I. Alam, A Nasser and A Shah., 2022].   
Owing to low strength characteristics of soils used in making the bricks in Bugonya 
village with the soils having predominantly high moisture content, the bricks made have 
high water absorption ratio. This makes them unfit to be used for superior work of a 
permanent nature due to their resulting high shrinkage and low compressive strength 

6 
 
of 1.54 N/mm
2 which is lower compared to the minimum standards requirements for a 
first class brick of 10N/mm
2.Their brittleness and tensile strength are low too [Sanya. 
T, 2021]. 
The durability and strength of the unfired bricks in general are lower than those of fired 
or concrete bricks [Muheise-Araalia. D, 2021]. 
On that note however, further research is required to gain deeper knowledge of soil 
properties for the design of proper geotechnical and geological investigations to search 
for more fitting materials for earth construction especially when salvaged steel fibers 
from waste tyres should be used [Eko M, 2021].  
This study shall deploy the salvaged steel fibres in strengthening unfired mud bricks for 
improved physical and engineering properties. The result will thus lead to an alternative 
which is more environmentally friendly and cheap compared to the energy-hungry fired-
brick production with a high carbon footprint, and expensive in the rural community.

1.3 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY 
1.3.1   MAIN OBJECTIVE 
To determine the suitability of using steel fibres from waste tires as reinforcements in 
the unfired earth brick. 

7 
 
 1.3.2   Specific objectives 
1. To determine the physical and mechanical properties of soil to be used for making 
the earth bricks 
2. To determine the effect of salvaged steel fibres from waste tyres on the compressive 
strength and water absorption properties of unfired earth bricks. 
3. To determine the optimum steel fibre content for mix in the bricks during 
reinforcement. 
1.4    RESEARCH QUESTIONS 
1.What are the physical and mechanical properties of the soil to be used in making    
the earth bricks? 
2.  What is the effect of salvaged steel fibres from waste tyres on the compressive 
strength and water absorption properties of unfired earth bricks ? 
3. What is the optimum steel fibre content for mix in the bricks during reinforcement 
? 
1.5   JUSTIFICATION 
Inclusion of fibres in the clay matrix enhanced the resistance against shrinkage, 
abrasion and erosion . [Sujatha and Devi, 2018] and [Sharma et al, 2021] observed a 

8 
 
decrease in shrinkage as the fibres inhibit the propagation of cracks and also bridge 
them . The shrinkage decreased with the increase in fibre content. 
Steel has a high durability, ductility, tensile strength, corrosion resistance and 
hardenability hence making it a strong additive to strengthen the unfired earth brick 
[Ubong A, 2023]. 
The use of Fiber reinforcement in stabilizing earthen structures seeks to improve the 
ductility, toughness, tensile strength, and durability of the stabilized soil in addition to 
increasing its strength [Wada P, 2021]. 
Steel fibres in the clay matrix act as springs and absorb a great deal of plastic energy 
and also resist deformation without full disintegration. 
Steel from waste tyres has a good adhesion with proven mechanical strength of upto 
2165 MPa thus making it an ideal additive to the unfired earth brick . 
On carrying out experiments including density, water absorption, shrinkage, 
compressive strength, tensile strength, wearing and erosion on soil blocks made with 
two soil types and enhanced with three fibre types at 0.25–1 weight percent. It was 
found that the physical, mechanical and durability properties of the blocks were 
generally improved and a recommendation of 0.5 weight percent fibre content and high 
clayey soil are made [Danso et al, 2022 ]. 

9 
 
The improved performance is attributed to a fair increase in clay content in the soils 
employed, thereby enhancing cohesion and elevating strength (Krishnaiah and P. 
Suryanarayana Reddy, 2008). Another possibility could be tied to the fibrous nature in 
the composition, as the fibres could cut down on its hygrometric shrinkage and release 
water at a slow rate (Sasui et al., 2018; Quagliarini and Lenci, 2010; Mbereyaho et al., 
2019). However, this compressive strength is still less than that obtained when cement 
was used as a stabilizer (Patowary, et al., 2015). This indicates that the manufacture 
of unfired earth bricks would be suitable for use in single-story buildings.  
The addition of fibrous materials in earthen construction will enhance ductility, tensile 
strength erosion resistance, and dimensional stability, while reducing shrinkage 
cracking in the materials (Walker, 2004). To vouch safe earth brick applications, weather 
resistance will be made an important recommendation (Ukwizagira & Mbereyaho, 
2023). 
The reinforcement of the soil using fiber has been the most preferred idea in 
geotechnical and geoenvironment engineering. Soil reinforcement is brought about 
using randomly distributed discrete fibers to be modeled as grass and/or plants growing 
on a slope to be effectively stabilized. This is more simple compared to soil-reinforced 
discrete short fibers which can maintain isotropic strength without introducing possible 
weak planes compared with conventional geosynthetics reinforcement methods. Fiber-
reinforced soil is like a composite material in that the fibers serve to improve on the 
strength of the soil. Shear stresses on ground facilitate improved tensile strength for 

10 
 
the fibers which in turn resist greater the soil. The use of fibers in soils is very closely 
matched to the response of plant roots such that they add resistance to geotechnical 
and geoenvironmental load which subsequently contributes to soil stability at near-
surface soils in which effective stress is low (Medina-Martinez et al., 2022). 
Adding fibers to soil greatly increases its resistance to non-elastic shrinkage, cracks, 
impacts, etc. Thus, fibers act as strengthening agents for earth blocks enabling them 
to absorb more energy and resist more loads, making them a viable product in the 
earthquake-prone areas. The incorporation of fibers, apart from strengthening, 
contributes to the resistive property of earthen bricks to deformability. Concurrently, 
it was found that reinforced earth blocks contain less water retention. 
Typically, conventional options would offer less. The use of chemical and synthetic 
fibers as stabilizers and reinforcers results in a stabilized block with a strength above 
twice that of a normal stabilized block. To strengthen this theory results from laboratory 
investigations complemented implementing the potential application of fibers in 
earthen materials which subsequently would enhance the resistance against plastic 
shrinkage, impact and increased toughness . Studies have shown a considerable 
enhancement in post crack flexural behavior as compared with blocks without 
reinforcement. Fiber addition enhances the sorptivity behavior as it improves the bond 
matrix. This is confirmed by studies from author C.K. Subra-manian Prasad et.al. when 
the fiber content was constrained. When kit fiber and bottle fiber were compared, they 

11 
 
later showed more sorptivity. Sergio Neves Monteiro Proclaims that fibers should be 
even more concentrated for an end with standing block (Jesudass et al., 2020). 
Unreinforced blocks were observed to fail suddenly with one large crack, whereas 
sugarcane bagasse fibre reinforced soil blocks failed gradually with multiple finer 
cracks. If the failure is described as more gradual, then it acted more like a ductile 
material than a brittle one, thus supporting  more loads before disintegration  Bouhicha 
et al. (2005) and Cai et al. (2006). When blocks were pulled from the testing machine, 
while they split into two halves, these were still held together by the fibre. Therefore, 
this indicates that fibre-enhanced soil blocks fail slowly, rather than suddenly, and will 
support a load for a while after their failure (Danso et al., n.d.). 
Firing is done for strengthening the clay soil to become as tough as stone. Unfortunately, 
the process of making per one fired brick emits 0.4 kg of CO2 and consumes about 2 
kWh (Munoz Felasco et al., 2014). Earlier researches on the production of unfired clay 
bricks have incorporated added materials as reinforcements that commonly form the 
so-called reinforced bricks. Some of those studies used natural plant fibers such as 
straw (Binici et al., 2005), sisal (Njau and Park, 2015), coir (Danso et al., 2015; Salih et 
al., 2020), and sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) bagasse fiber (SBF) (Danso et al., 
2015; Salih et al., 2020).  
Cement is also a popular choice when added to clay bricks because of its good 
mechanical properties; however, this very marble cement is not favored 
environmentally due to the associated high energy consumed and CO2 released in the 

12 
 
process of making cement (Zhang, 2013; Marcelino-Sadaba et al., 2017; Joglekar et al., 
2018). The production of one tonne of cement consumes around 5.6 GJ of energy and 
gives out about one tonne of CO2, contributing 7% of emissions into the atmosphere 
(Shubbar et al., 2018). Therefore eco-friendly reinforcement or stabilizer must be 
employed to produce unfired clay bricks (Danso et al., 2015).

CHAPTER TWO : LITERATURE REVIEW 
 
2.1     INTRODUCTION 
In times where construction activities are increasingly having adverse impacts on the 
environment, sustainability and environmental friendly alternatives are much so 
required to serve as alternatives to the traditionally available building materials. 
Unfired bricks in specific are a very viable option for attaining sustainability since they 
require available natural materials and their production consumes low energy levels. 
Their production also excludes burning which leads to maintenance of specifically low 
carbon foot print.  
The selection for use of these unfired earth bricks in enhanced load bearing structures 
is still restricted due to their inherently low mechanical strength and other structural 
weaknesses more so related to withstanding loads and abrasion from external factors 
(Asha C et al, 2023). Various researches have incorporated a vast number of 
reinforcement techniques to boost the strength performance and durability of the earth 
bricks mainly through the use of natural, synthetic fibers to a certain extent industrial 
by products too. However, a reliable solution could arise from the use of steel fibers 
from waste tyres as a reinforcement element in the unfired earth bricks.  
Earthen bricks are still more brittle and weaker in compression  and bending vis a vis  
concrete masonry units  and fired bricks . Their compressive strength values range 

14 
 
between 1.3 to 4.0 MPa, which is greatly lower than burnt bricks and concrete blocks, 
which average between 17.24 MPa and 13.10 MPa, respectively . 
 Application of steel fibers can improve ductility, thus in the wake of a disaster will 
delay catastrophic failure in effect giving building occupants time to escape, as opposed 
to facing the risk of injury or even fatality because of sudden failure. 
Conversely, synthetic fibers such as steel are known to enhance concrete freeze–thaw 
resistance, impact resistance plus mitigate shrinkage cracking. In soils used for 
geotechnical applications, the addition of isotropically distributed steel fibers better 
the unconfined compressive strength, ductility, residual strength, absorbed energy, 
flexural toughness, and splitting tensile strength of soil mixtures. 
In other studies, where steel fibers have been added to cement based materials the 
tensile and flexural strength was enhanced which implies that such positive action can 
be advanced to earth bricks. This review therefore is aimed at in depth examination of 
the existing knowledge sources about the use of fiber reinforcement in earth bricks 
with keen attention on mechanical performance, durability and sustainability in the use 
of fiber-reinforced unfired earth bricks. 
2.2    RESEARCH CONSTRAINTS 
In the body of research available about reinforcement of earth bricks, studies are 
majorly concentrated on natural and other synthetic fibers which has left the potential 
of steel fibers from waste tyres largely unexplored. This calls for comprehensive studies 

15 
 
on how varying amounts of steel fibers could affect the mechanical properties and 
further determine the optimal fiber content for maximum brick performance. 
2.3   OVERVIEW 
The increase of the population and urbanization in Uganda has led to constant demand 
for transportation efficiency coupled with the change in living standards that all call 
for vehicle purchase. This all comes with tyre production from which the tyres come to 
become waste after their initial functionality is done. 10-15% of the entire mass of tyres 
is the steel fibers depending on the type and size of the tyre in question (Haydar 
G,2021). 
 Uganda faces an acute problem with waste tyre disposal, estimates suggest that around 
600,000 to 800,000 waste tyres are generated yearly. This problem is exacerbated by 
the increasing number of vehicles, with many of these tyres being improperly disposed 
of causing environmental concerns. This situation underscores the need for more 
effective waste management systems and recycling activities a case in point being 
reusing these tyres as reinforcements in the unfired earth brick.  
Waste tyres are a threat to the environment due to their non-biodegradable nature 
which implies that once they are disposed into the environment they pose a risk of 
spreading micro plastics once when they wear out. Once they find their way into water 
bodies, aquatic ecosystems are distorted and if these aquatic species are consumed by 
humans the micro plastics find their way into the human gut and pose a health risk to 

16 
 
the human consumers (Haydar G,2021). Reusing these steel fibers as a reinforcement 
in earth bricks will help to reduce the demand for new steel production which conserves 
natural resources and sustains a circular economy.  
The research study will further help in reducing tyre incineration, an activity that 
increases the carbon footprint in the atmosphere and release of other harmful 
substances such as sulfur oxides. Through repurposing the steel fibers for use in earth 
bricks, the need for incineration will be checked. Before addition of new components 
into any masonry unit, it is key to understand the behavior of its properties under 
different conditions. Commonly, bricks are made of clay and sand and mixed in various 
proportions to which sometimes a binder is added. The stabilized block is then pressed 
into the required shape as per the design requirements and it is either fired or sun 
dried. For the case of the firing of bricks, environmental degradation is high because a 
brick kiln emits about 70-282 g of carbon dioxide, 0.001-0.29g of black carbon, 0.29-
5.78g of carbon monoxide and 0.15-1.56g of particulate matter per kilogram of brick 
fired (Phillip Z.2020). About 0.54-3.14 MJ of specific energy are consumed depending 
on the type of kiln and fuel used for firing.  
With the incorporation of fibers and other industrial waste products into the earth brick 
matrix, variation was noticed in the properties depending on composition and 
manufacturing procedures. Bricks are graded and classified based on design codes which 
much so rely on the purpose of the brick and the kind of environmental conditions that 
they will be exposed to. A thorough study of the material used in the making of bricks 

17 
 
and the factors related to the brick properties is highly required for standardization of 
the bricks.  
Reuse of agricultural by-products in bricks presents advantages such as a lower cost and 
ecological saving not neglecting the fact that natural fiber sources are renewable and 
environmentally friendly. Earth bricks reinforced by agricultural wastes and other fibers 
were studied with the equilibrium moisture content for the bricks under different 
conditions being less than 7% (Anant L et al,2020). The brick physical and mechanical 
properties were also improved for the different materials used.  
Morel et al summarized the mechanical behavior of unstabilised rammed earth 
produced blocks whose compressive strengths lie in a range of 1.5-3.0 MPa with 
densities from 1763 to 2160 kg/m3. He noticed that higher strengths could be reached 
using a hydraulic press to boost the brick typical compressive strengths hence 
compaction will also be done in our research. 
For dry building elements made of earth the compressive strength of 2-5 MPa should be 
used (Minke,2019) and also poor earth materials may have strength as low as 1 MPa and 
the optimums can go as high as 10 MPa. According to (Schroder,2017), numerous factors 
such as grain distribution, grain quality, clay mineral quality, quantity of clay minerals, 
binding strength of the materials, preparation and amount of water used in production 
work of the bricks all influence the dry compressive strength of the earth as a building 
material. 

18 
 
2.4    STRENGTHS OF UNFIRED EARTH BRICKS  
Nondried earth blocks are ecologically friendly; they are manufactured from readily 
available natural materials with a low carbon footprint and impact. These clay 
materials for earth blocks naturally insulate against heat and cold in the regulation and 
control of indoor temperatures. Unfired earth bricks regulate moisture because they 
can absorb moisture and release some, and this helps to maintain comfortable indoor 
humidity levels (Alkhatib S., 2023).  
According to (Ndyambaje P, 2019), the compressive strength and tensile strength of the 
modified earth bricks containing synthetic fibres improved over the unreinforced earth 
bricks, while the optimum modification effect was obtained at 8% by weight of the 
fibres to soil. This means that the addition of recycled fibres to the matrix of earth 
bricks positively influences the compressive and tensile strengths of the bricks. This is 
crucial as the maximum possible compressive and tensile strengths are the parameters 
that most significantly respectively define the mechanical characteristics of soil blocks. 
Therefore, it is suggested that the use of 8% steel fiber content by weight is made by 
the practitioners for improving strength properties in soil blocks.  
  Such earthen users for construction should go for very clayey soil as it makes earth 
bricks modified with fibers perform better in carrying as compared to other binders 
that do better with sandy soils. These modified soil bricks are just apt for use as a 
building material particularly for developing countries where a housing deficit 
continues because of the high costs of traditional building  materials. 

19 
 
2.5    WEAKNESSES OF UNFIRED EARTH BRICKS 
Unfired earth bricks generally have a Compressive Strength lower than fired bricks, 
making them less suitable for  high load-bearing structures in some applications .  They 
have, therefore, been further disqualified for use in high-load-bearing structures. Their 
susceptibility to fading and weathering is a cause for concern. It is not only the cases 
of excessive precipitation and prolonged moisture exposure that will cause damage, 
but also the case of the lack of proper sealant or even protection treatment (Kannan 
G, 2023).  
Limited Structural Applications: While extra-low low-strength bricks are in their 
application domain for small-load structures, strength requirements that they may fall 
short of for high-loading applications may call for supplementary reinforcement. 
Besides, unfired earth bricks may also require extensive maintenance to ensure 
longevity, particularly in climates with extreme weather conditions. Production by all 
means of unfired earth bricks is labor-intensive, where the process is very time-
consuming and labor-intensive when compared to the automated production of fired 
bricks (Sharma T, 2023). 
According to the series of inspections outlined above, they are an excellent candidate 
for an alternative green building material, especially in some climate and building 
typologies. The strengths in thermal performance and sustainability have to be offset 
against some weaknesses in structural capacity and weather resistance.

2.7   WHY USE STEEL FIBRES? 
When steel fibers are introduced into brick materials, they help in developing tensile 
and flexural strengths in bricks so that they endure stresses during operational times. 
These fibers could also have differences in flexibility from the regular brick material, 
which could result in better handling and performance on all surfaces (Paul S, 2022) . 
Since the soil is basically clayey-silty, the clay acts like cement in concrete, bonding 
the larger particles in the brick. Silt acts as a filtering agent for the soil and is really 

21 
 
aggregates which need binding forces. Steel fibres act as binding agents by bridging 
cracks in the soil matrix thus serves that need.  
Using salvaged steel fibres as additives in earth bricks decreased erosion rates from soil 
blocks sprayed with water. This shows that the modified earth bricks resist erosion 
better than unreinforced earth bricks. This resistance will assist construction workers 
in fighting the durability challenge in earth structure construction. 
Fibers are also very likely to prevent all those challenges which earth construction 
would have suffered like reduction of strength and durability.  
The type of soil from which soil blocks are manufactured is important because soil 
happens to be the major material which is present not less than 90% in any reinforced 
soil block. This indicates that clay soils perform quite well.  
Steel fibers can thus ensure very good adhesion with the clay matrix, improving the 
overall performance of bricks and reducing chances of disintegration. From the 
sustainability point of view, Steel fibers add a very little weight compared with the 
advantages derived from using them in bricks. Therefore, the idea should be practical 
when it comes to improving the performance of bricks without considerably increasing 
the mass of the bricks (Singh S, 2021). 
 Steel fibers can provide insulation to bricks made from clay matrix so that they can 
regulate the temperature well thereby making them energy efficient. 

22 
 
Steel fibers would improve the water resistance of bricks as they would create a denser 
material thereby reducing the porosity, thus improving the resistance to water 
absorption as seen in reinforced samples (Beddar, M, 2024). 
2.8  STEEL FIBRE COMPOSITION  
Tyres are a homogenous product with an average composition as follows; 
1. Carbon 70-75%,  
2. zinc oxide 1.2-2.0%,  
3. hydrogen 6-7%, 
4. sulphur 1.3-1.7%,  
5. iron 13-155 and additives 3.5-5%. 
2.9  PHYSICAL PROPERTIES 
Length and Diameter: Steel fibers are mostly fine and can vary in diameter (mainly 
around 0.1 mm to 1 mm) and lengths (from a few millimeters to several centimeters). 
Shapes: Steel fibres can be crimped or straight, which aids in improving bonding with 
the rubber matrix. In this case we used an isotropic arrangement where steel fibres 
were randomly mixed into the steel fibres to attain an isotropic end product. 

23

2.9.1  GENERAL EFFECTS OF APPLYING ASSORTED SYNTHETIC AND PLANT FIBRES 
ON BRICKS 
 Increased Flexural Strength: Fibers like steel, polypropylene, or even natural fibers 
can augment the flexural strength of bricks, therefore making them less likely to crack 
under stress. Another observed benefit is on impact resistance since the fibers present 
in bricks increase shock absorption and decrease the probability of breakage. (Ullah. S, 
2024)  
Beyond the critical fibre length,  increased fibre content induces strength reduction as 
the fibres begin to knot together (Ismail and Yaacob, 2011), thereby reducing cohesion 

24 
 
within the soil (Medjo Eko et al., 2012), and breaking up the soil matrix (Millogo et al., 
2014), resulting in reduction in strength of soil-fibre matrix.  
Studies examined the influence of recycled steel fibers on the mechanical properties 
of soil blocks. The addition of fibers in the soil blocks increased the density of the 
bricks, which could be attributed to the high density of the fiber. This consequently 
means that when used in the construction of houses, the weight of the entire house is 
going to be reduced. Earth bricks modified with steel fiber were observed to have a 
lower water absorption rate, which was attributed to the hydrophilic nature of these 
fibers; thus, higher steel fiber content within the earth bricks might absorb less water 
during the rainy season, resulting in positive impacts on some mechanical properties of 
the blocks.  
Higher Ductility: Fibers possess the ability to increase the ductility of bricks, enabling 
deformation without rupture in seismic regions and in applications involving torsional 
loads on the bricks. The addition of recycled steel fibers into the soil matrix improves 
the soil erosion resistance. Stated factors could explain the improved resistance of 
modified earth bricks because steel fibers prevent water from percolating through the 
soil particles, thus reducing the erosion effect on the bricks. This is a very useful 
property in high-rainfall areas where erosion of earth buildings is frequent (Danso et 
al.,2015).  
Steel fibers were used in earth to enhance significantly the deformation characteristics 
and load-deflection characteristics of unreinforced blocks. The blocks reinforced with 

25 
 
steel fibers also displayed ductile behavior after cracking. The ductility was attributed 
to the fibers bridging the cracks and holding the cracked portions together. Randomly 
mixing fibers into soil has been shown to increase the shear strength (Babu and 
Vasudevan et al.). Fibers enhance cohesion among soil particles while interaction 
among the fibers themselves, along with the flexibility of fibers, allows them to 
function like a structural mesh in keeping the soil together and improving its structural 
integrity. 
Most of the previously cited research by Morel et al. centered solely on the mechanical 
behavior of unreinforced rammed earth while compressed earth blocks were 
manufactured with a manual press. The compressive strengths of these unreinforced 
earth specimens ranged between 1.5-3 MPa, with corresponding densities varying 
between 1750-2150 Kg/m3. Reinforcement for this category allows achieving higher 
strengths and had compressive strengths most commonly lying at about 2-3 MPa-upper 
using hydraulic presses or some cement contents, Also presenting compressive strengths 
from 0.6-2.25 MPa for unreinforced earths as cited by Jimenez et al. 
Another important aspect of steel fibers in a system is their ability to bridge cracks such 
that, computed in a tensile sense, after cracking no longer means a fall to zero tensile 
strength, but where the strength stabilizes to a fairly constant value. In addition, fibers 
have contributed to concrete that improves its toughness. Toughness is the ability of a 
material to absorb energy and deform plastically before fracture. This is particularly 

26 
 
relevant to structural elements, which may be subjected to dynamic loading 
(Senesavath et al., 2022). 
2.9.2  THERMAL PERFORMANCE 
 The walls constructed with hypercompacted unfired hollow bricks show the best 
thermal performance, hence the steel fibres provide the compaction feature, and this 
is due to the presence of air pockets in the brick holes that significantly retard the heat 
flow between the outside and inside. In light of the above, thermal performances at 
the wall scale could be improved further with lightly compacted unfired hollow bricks 
containing synthetic fibers which combine a low material density, hence low thermal 
conductivity, with high thermal inertia due to pore water phase changes and extra 
thermal insulation provided by synthetic fibers and air pockets (Bruno et al., 2020). 
2.9.3  MODES OF ACTION OF STEEL FIBRE REINFORCEMENT IN BRICKS 
2.9.3.1  BRIDGING OF CRACKS 
When microcracks start forming in the brick due to shrinkage drying or through load 
application, steel fibres span across these cracks. The fibres tie through the gaps, 
keeping the crack faces together and preventing their widening. This delays brick 
failure. 
2.9.3.2  STRESS REDISTRIBUTION 

27 
 
This harnesses ductility and the brick’s ability to absorb and dissipate energy without 
britte failure. 
 
2.9.3.3  PULL-OUT RESISTANCE / MECHANICAL ANCHORAGE 
The fibres are hooked into the soil matrix. When stress is applied, they resist being 
pulled out. 
Hooked or crimped fibres increase this pull-out resistance via mechanical 
intertwining, providing better post-crack performance. 
The bond between the fibre and the soil-cement-clay mix is crucial. In unstabilized 
bricks, this bond is mostly mechanical (not chemical). 
2.9.3.4  POST-CRACKING LOAD CARRYING 
After the brick matrix cracks, the fibres continue to carry load  a concept known as 
residual strength. This increases toughness, meaning the brick can deform more 
without disintegrating. 
2.9.3.5  IMPROVED FLEXURAL AND IMPACT STRENGTH 
Earth bricks are naturally weak in tension and flexure. Fibres compensate for this 
weakness, especially under: Bending e.g., lintels, wall panels, Impact loading e.g., 
earthquakes, debris, Dynamic loads e.g., vibrations 

28 
 
2.9.4  PRODUCTION PROCESS 
 Mixing and Handling: Generally, the addition of fibers tends to alter the properties of 
mixing and handling of the brick material. Therefore, during mixing, care must be taken 
for the uniform distribution of fibers and the use of personal protective equipment.  
Material Costs: Although fibers enhance performance, they can equally contribute to 
production costs. The choice of fiber can greatly influence the costs involved.  
While fibers can offer improvements in mechanical properties, durability, and 
performance under diverse conditions in the brick-making process, their precise effects 
depend largely on the type and amount of fiber, together with the full composition of 
the bricks. 
2.9.5   ASPECT RATIO 
The aspect ratio of the fibers is another main factor in fiber-reinforced blocks. The 
term aspect ratio refers to the relationship between the length of the fibers and their 
diameter. Generally, high aspect ratios are known to enhance both the tensile and 
compressive strengths of the blocks which they reinforced. Generally, the use of 
synthetic and natural fibers in block reinforcement improves the ductility of the block 
so that in case of a disaster the block can still tolerate failure for some time giving 
some time for escape of occupants-thereby reducing casualties or injuries (Nazir M, 
2022). 

29 
 
2.9.6  BLENDING CONDITIONS 
The consistency of steel fibre-reinforced earth can be influenced by the time and 
temperature used during blending, thus delicate control is necessary to obtain 
optimal performance .(Li et al, 2006) investigated the impact of blending time on the 
permanent changes in synthetic fibres after mixing with earth. The findings showed 
that varying the blending time (45, 60 and 90 minutes) had no major effect on the 
properties of modified binders or reinforcements.

CHAPTER THREE: METHODOLOGY 
3.1   MATERIALS OF STUDY ACQUISITION 
3.1.1  STEEL FIBRES 
Steel fibres were acquired by extracting them from waste tyres by the process of 
shredding where steel fibres were pulled out of the tyre structure mechanically using a 
large hook called a bead extractor in a mechanized setting. 
After the steel fibres were extracted from the tyres, they were cut into varying lengths  
using a cutting disc and homogenously mixed with soil and water and the mixture 
applied in a Press mold with the soil to make the bricks. Peating was also done using a 
trowel to prevent exposure of brick fibre tips after production to combat any chance 
of rusting.
