ABSTRACT 
Lake Victoria, the world’s largest tropical freshwater lake, supports critical 
ecological, economic and social functions across East Africa. However, increasing 
industrial pollution, particularly in Walukuba Masese (Jinja district), poses a serious 
threat. The uncontrolled discharge of untreated effluent especially from the sunbelt 
textile industry has led to elevated phosphorous levels, causing eutrophication, 
harmful algal blooms and aquatic degradation. 
This study investigates the use of iron oxide and silica, as a sustainable method for 
phosphorous removal from industrial waste water. Laboratory experiments assessed 
adsorption efficiency based on parameters such as contact time, adsorbent dosage, 
Ph, and initial phosphorous concentration. The adsorption mechanism relies on Fe-
O-P bond formation, where phosphates ions interact with hydroxyl groups on iron 
oxide surfaces. Silica enhances this process by increasing surface area structural 
stability. 
Finding reveals that the iron oxide and silica combination offers a cost effective and 
environmentally sustainable alternative to conventional treatment methods. 
Significant reductions in phosphorous levels were observed, demonstrating the 
potential of this system to meet regulatory standards and protect Lake Victoria’s 
aquatic ecosystem. This research highlights the importance of adopting innovative, 
efficient wastewater treatment technologies for long term water resource 
sustainability.

CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION 
This chapter entails relevant information about the project, problem statement, 
objectives of the study, purpose of the study, justification and the scope of the 
study.  
1.1. BACKGROUND  
Lakes provide essential ecological, social and economic benefits. Lake Victoria, the 
largest tropical fresh water lake plays a key role in supporting industries, fishing, 
agriculture and recreation of East Africa region, contributing to the Gross National 
Product (GNP) of a nation (Ndugga, 2021). The area surrounding Lake Victoria, 
specifically the Walukuba Masese landing site in Jinja District, is highly 
industrialized and densely populated, with a high proportion of the population living 
alongside the lake (Hussein, 2023). The industries in the lake's catchment area 
include fish processing, food and beverage, pharmaceuticals, plastics, mattresses, 
metal fabricating industries and textile industries. Careless disposal of industrial 
effluents and other waste materials has led to significant water pollution, 
particularly increasing the concentration of nutrients in the lake’s waters, primarily 
from sunbelt textile industry.  
Industrial pollution in Uganda is rising, posing a significant environmental risk. 
Pollution emitted by industries is one of the key contributors to the deterioration of 
water quality in the country. The availability and quality of water are directly linked 
to the quality of life, with water quality often reflecting the state of economic 
development. Groundwater and surface water bodies can be contaminated by 
several sources. In urban areas, careless disposal of industrial effluents and other 
wastes significantly contributes to poor water quality (Tariq & Mushtaq, 2023). Most 

 
2 
 
of the water bodies in developing regions are polluted by untreated effluents 
discharged from industries (Chowdhary, Bhargava, Mishra, & Khan, 2020).  
 Parts of Lake Victoria along the areas of walukuba masese in jinja district receive 
untreated effluents from surrounding industries, which have significantly degraded 
the water quality. These industries discharge waste into the lake almost without any 
adequate treatment, resulting in high concentrations of nutrients like phosphorous. 
This poses severe threats to both aquatic life and human health, leading to problems 
such as eutrophication, harmful algal blooms, loss of biodiversity, groundwater 
contamination, and acidification of the water (Taako & Andama, 2024). This 
research aims to assess the use of iron oxide nano bio-adsorbent to remove nutrients 
from waste water.  
1.2. PROBLEM STATEMENT   
Pollution due to increased urban development has taken a toll on the fresh water 
ecosystems especially the proximal fresh water ecosystems, contributing to their 
deterioration, destruction and loss. Parts of Lake Victoria along the areas of 
walukuba masese in jinja district are affected by pollution from human activities 
like industrialization, sewage disposal among others (Marriott and Humphrey ,2023 
). Lake victoria  faces a significant challenge from the industrial effluents from 
the sunbelt industry, a leather tanning industry. These have high nutrient 
concentrations especially phosphorous in the water (Walakira and Okot-Okumu, 
2023). Recent studies have revealed that the phosphorous concentration in some 
parts of lake Victoria along the areas of walukuba masese landing sites exceed 
permissible levels with an average concentration of 35.67 mg/L which is way above 

 
3 
 
the concentration standards of NEMA which are set at 10mg/L (ministry of water and 
environment, 2023).  
 High phosphorous concentration in the effluent and subsequent catchment poses 
severe threats to both aquatic life and human health, in terms of eutrophication 
and harmful algal blooms. These impact the biodiversity, ground water 
contamination, acidification of the water, among others. The current situation 
calls for urgent attention to mitigate the adverse impacts of increased nutrient 
concentrations on the ecosystems and safeguard the health and wellbeing of the 
people in the mentioned catchment areas inclusive of those directly benefiting 
from the lake. This research aims at assessing the use of iron oxide and silica in 
industrial wastewater treatment.  
1.3. OBJECTIVES  
1.3.1. Main Objective  
To assess the use of iron oxide and silica in industrial wastewater treatment. 
1.3.2. Specific objectives  
1. To determine the Physicochemical parameters of the wastewater effluent  
2. Assessing the performance of iron oxide and silica in phosphorous removal from 
wastewater. 
3. To design a wastewater treatment system for the wastewater effluent using 
iron oxide and silica. 
1.4. RESEARCH QUESTIONS  
1. What are the Physicochemical parameters of the wastewater effluent?  
2. What is the performance of iron oxide and silica in phosphorous removal from 
wastewater.

3. How will the wastewater treatment system be designed? 
1.5. GEOGRAPHICAL SCOPE  
Sunbelt textile industries located along walukuba and masese landing sites in Jinja 
district.    
1.6. JUSTIFICATION   
The discharge of untreated industrial wastewater into aquatic ecosystems, such as 
lakes like Lake Victoria, poses significant health risks to communities that depend 
on these water sources. Elevated phosphorus levels in such effluents are a primary 
contributor to eutrophication, leading to detrimental effects like algal blooms, 
oxygen depletion, and degradation of water quality. Therefore, it is imperative to 
reduce phosphorus concentrations in wastewater to meet environmental discharge 
standards and protect aquatic ecosystems (Frankel,2022).   
Iron oxide-based bio-adsorbents have emerged as a promising solution for 
phosphorus removal from wastewater. Their high surface area and abundance of 
active sites facilitate effective adsorption of phosphate ions. The mechanism 
involves the formation of hydroxyl groups on the iron oxide surface in aqueous 
environments, which interact with phosphate ions through ligand exchange 
reactions. This process results in the displacement of surface hydroxyl groups by 
phosphate, forming stable Fe–O–P bonds, thereby effectively removing phosphorus 
from the water. 
To enhance the adsorption capacity of iron oxides, it is incorporated with bio-
adsorbents like silica. Silica increases the overall surface area and reactivity of the 
composite material, providing additional active sites for pollutant binding. This 

 
5 
 
synergistic effect leads to higher adsorption capacities, making the composite 
material more efficient in removing contaminants from wastewater. 
1.7. Adsorption Mechanism of Phosphorus  
Iron oxides (Fe₂O₃ or Fe₃O₄) are known to have a high affinity for phosphate ions 
due to their surface charge and the ability to undergo ligand exchange reactions. In 
the presence of water, iron oxide surfaces become hydroxylated, forming –OH groups 
that can interact with phosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in solution. The phosphate ions 
displace hydroxyl groups on the surface of the iron oxide particles, forming Fe–O–P 
bonds.  
Fe-OHs+ H₂PO₄⁻aq→ Fe-O-PO₄²⁻s+ H₂Ol 
 Phosphate ions bond with the iron oxide's hydroxyl groups, leading to the formation 
of inner-sphere complexes:  
Fe(OH)₃s+ PO₄³⁻aq → FePO₄s + 3OH⁻ aq 
This mechanism allows for strong binding of phosphorus onto the iron oxide surface, 
effectively reducing its concentration in wastewater. The silica component of iron 
oxide further enhances this adsorption due to its increased surface area and 
reactivity, leading to higher adsorption capacities.

CHAPTER TWO: LITERATURE REVIEW 
2.0 INTRODUCTION  
Water pollution due to excess nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen has become 
a major environmental concern worldwide. These nutrients, when present in 
excessive amounts, can lead to severe water quality degradation, eutrophication, 
harmful algal blooms, and oxygen depletion in aquatic ecosystems. Wastewater from 
industrial, agricultural, and urban activities is often loaded with these nutrients, 
requiring effective treatment methods. Among various strategies, adsorption using 
iron oxide nano bio-adsorbents has emerged as a promising solution for the removal 
of these nutrients, particularly phosphorus, from wastewater.  
2.1. Sources of Nutrient Contaminants in Textile Wastewater and Their Impact 
on Water Treatment 
Textile wastewater contains various pollutants, including dyes, heavy metals, 
surfactants, and organic and inorganic nutrients. The presence of nutrients, 
particularly nitrogen and phosphorus compounds, is a significant concern as it can 
contribute to water pollution and eutrophication if not properly treated. 
One major source of nutrients in textile wastewater is the use of synthetic dyes. 
Many dyes, including reactive, azo, and acid dyes which contain nitrogen-based 
functional groups. During the dyeing process, a considerable portion of these dyes 
remains unbounded to the fabric, and it is subsequently washed off, leading to 
increased nitrogen levels in the effluent. Furthermore, some dyes incorporate 
phosphorus compounds, further elevating the nutrient content in wastewater. 
Similarly, sizing agents and starch-based additives used in the pre-treatment phase 
introduce organic polymers such as starch, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), and 

 
7 
 
carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). When these substances degrade, they release 
ammonia, nitrates, and organic nitrogen into the wastewater, contributing to 
nutrient pollution. 
Detergents and surfactants used in textile processing play a role in introducing 
nutrients into wastewater. Most of the commercial detergents contain phosphate-
based compound that act as water softeners and cleaning enhancers. Since 
phosphates are highly soluble, they persist in wastewater and contribute to 
phosphorus pollution. If discharged without adequate treatment, these compounds 
promote excessive algal growth in water bodies, hence leading to eutrophication 
and oxygen depletion. Furthermore, biochemical reactions occurring within effluent 
holding tanks also elevate nutrient levels. As organic matter decomposes under 
microbial activity, nitrogenous compounds such as ammonia and nitrates are 
released, further increasing the nutrient concentration in wastewater, hence calling 
the need for treatment. 
The source of water used in textile industries can also influence nutrient levels in 
the final effluent. If the water is sourced from rivers, lakes, or groundwater already 
containing high concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus, these nutrients become 
part of the textile wastewater stream. Pre-treatment methods may not effectively 
remove all contaminants, resulting in an accumulation of nutrients in the discharged 
effluent. Furthermore, fabric softeners and finishing chemicals used in the final 
stages of textile production contain nitrogenous and phosphorus-based compounds, 
which dissolve into wastewater during washing and rinsing processes.

2.2. WASTEWATER 
Waste water is used water that has been affected by domestic, commercial and 
industrial use. Waste water is composed of 99.9% water and the remaining 0.1% 
contains organic matter, inorganic compounds and microorganisms (wang, 2021). 
Waste water effluents are released to a variety environment, like lakes, ponds, 
streams, rivers and estuaries.  
2.2.1. COMPOSITION OF WASTE WATER 
Wastewater is a complex mixture of various substances originating from households, 
industries, and commercial activities. It is primarily composed of water, including 
both freshwater and contaminated natural water sources. A significant portion of 
wastewater consists of organic matter such as food waste, human and animal waste, 
oils, fats, proteins, and plant materials, which serve as energy sources for 
microorganisms in treatment processes. Nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus, 
derived from detergents, human waste, and agricultural runoff, can lead to water 
pollution and eutrophication if untreated. Suspended solids, including sediments, 
soil, food particles, paper, and plastics, are also common in wastewater. 
Additionally, it may contain hazardous chemicals such as heavy metals, pesticides, 
solvents, pharmaceuticals, and industrial toxins, posing environmental and health 
risks. Pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and parasites from human and animal 
waste, further highlight the need for proper wastewater treatment. The pH and 
temperature of wastewater vary depending on its source and can influence the 
efficiency of treatment processes, with higher temperatures generally enhancing 
microbial activity. Effective treatment is crucial to prevent pollution, protect 
ecosystems, and ensure safe water reuse (wang, 2021).

2.2.2. SOURCES AND TYPES OF WASTEWATER 
Wastewater which also known as raw sewage originates from households, industries, 
commercial or institutional facilities. 
2.2.2.1. Domestic wastewater 
Domestic wastewater includes all water generated by home dwelling, public 
restrooms, public restrooms, schools and other health centers, apartments. They all 
produce high volumes of wastewater.

2.2.2.2. Industrial wastewater 
Industrial wastewater refers to liquid waste generated from industrial 
processes such as manufacturing, food processing, and other production 
activities. The composition and level of contamination in industrial 
wastewater vary depending on the type of industry and the chemicals 
involved in its operations. Industrial wastewater is generally classified based 
on 
its 
physical, 
chemical, 
and 
biological 
properties 
(Łukasz 
Wujcicki,2023). 
There are two main categories of industrial wastewater: 
1. Inorganic Industrial Wastewater – This type originates from 
industries such as steel production, electroplating plants, and coal 
processing facilities. It primarily contains inorganic pollutants, 
including heavy metals, acids, and other non-biodegradable 
substances. 
2. Organic Industrial Wastewater – This is generated from industries 
that heavily rely on organic compounds for their processes, such as 
textile 
manufacturing, 
tannery 
operations, 
and 
chemical 

 
11 
 
production. The wastewater from these industries contains organic 
pollutants, including dyes, solvents, and biodegradable chemicals 
2.2.2.3. Characteristics of constituents of wastewater. 
Constituents of Waste Water are characterized in terms of their physical, chemical, 
and biological composition. 
2.2.2.3.1. Physical characteristics 
Turbidity  
Turbidity is a measure of water clarity, typically caused by suspended particles such 
as organic matter and fine particles like clay. High turbidity in wastewater effluent 
can severely affect aquatic ecosystems by reducing light penetration, hindering 
aquatic plants from performing photosynthesis, and disrupting the natural balance 
of the water body (Walakira & OkotOkumu, 2023). Turbidity is quantified using a 
nephelometric method, which involves passing light through the water sample and 
measuring the light that is scattered by particles. The unit of measurement for 
turbidity is the Nephelometric Turbidity Unit (NTU). According to the National 
Environment Management Authority (NEMA), the acceptable discharge standard for 
wastewater effluent is 300 NTU. 
Total Suspended Solids (TSS)  
Total suspended solids (TSS) refer to particles that are not soluble in water and remain 
suspended due to their density being less than water. These particles can include 
organic and inorganic matter. A common source of TSS is untreated or improperly 
treated wastewater effluent. TSS is a critical parameter in wastewater quality 

 
12 
 
analysis as it impacts aquatic life by reducing oxygen levels and light penetration, 
creating poor water conditions. 
2.2.2.3.2. Chemical characteristics 
PH 
pH is the measure of the concentration hydrogen ions, indicating whether water is 
acidic (pH < 7), neutral (pH = 7), or alkaline (pH > 7). The pH is an important 
parameter as it affects other water treatment processes. Wastewater effluent 
having a pH value that is not within the NEMA discharge standards will have a 
negative impact on the receiving water bodies when discharged. Effluent with low 
pH levels can cause acidity in the receiving water bodies affecting fish in terms of 
growth and reproductive activities (Aghalari et al,2023). pH in wastewater affects 
the biological reactions and low levels inhibits growth of nitrifying bacteria which 
are essential for removing ammonia and nitrates from wastewater. 
Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)  
Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) is a measure of the amount of dissolved oxygen 
required by aerobic microorganisms to decompose organic matter present in 
wastewater. High BOD levels indicate a high concentration of organic pollutants, 
which can originate from agricultural runoff, industrial effluents, and sewage 
(Zayed, 2023). When wastewater with high BOD is discharged into surface water, it 
depletes the dissolved oxygen levels, threatening aquatic organisms, particularly 
fish, which rely on oxygen for respiration. BOD is measured over five days (BOD5), 
and results are expressed in milligrams per liter (mg/L). BOD testing is essential for 
evaluating the performance of wastewater treatment systems and determining 
effluent quality.  

 
13 
 
Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)  
Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) refers to the amount of oxygen required to 
chemically oxidize organic and inorganic compounds in water. It is a crucial 
parameter for assessing the organic load in wastewater and its impact on receiving 
water bodies (Mensah, 2022). High COD levels in wastewater indicate the presence 
of pollutants, and discharging such effluent can drastically reduce dissolved oxygen 
levels, further stressing aquatic life.  
COD analysis provides a rapid estimate of organic pollution in water samples.  
Total Phosphorus  
Total phosphorus refers to the sum of all phosphorus forms in wastewater, including 
soluble and insoluble forms. Ortho-phosphates are the most easily removed form of 
phosphorus during wastewater treatment. Phosphorus typically enters wastewater 
from domestic sources such as detergents, human waste, and food residues. High 
phosphorus levels in wastewater discharged into water bodies contribute to 
eutrophication, promoting excessive algal growth (Wang, 2021). This algal 
overgrowth leads to oxygen depletion in the water as algae die and decompose, 
resulting in the death of aquatic organisms due to insufficient oxygen levels.  
pH  
pH is a measure of the hydrogen ion concentration, indicating whether water is 
acidic (pH < 7), neutral (pH = 7), or alkaline (pH > 7). The pH of wastewater affects 
many chemical and biological processes, including treatment efficiency. Wastewater 
effluent that falls outside the NEMA discharge standard range for pH can disrupt the 
receiving water bodies. For example, low pH (acidic) wastewater can affect the 
reproductive and growth processes of fish and other aquatic life. pH is commonly 

 
14 
 
measured using a pH meter, making it an essential parameter for water quality 
assessment. 
2.3. Iron oxide bio-adsorbent 
2.3.1. Iron Oxide Bio-Adsorbents for Phosphorus Removal  
Iron oxide-based materials are particularly effective in removing phosphorus from 
wastewater due to their high affinity for phosphate ions. The silica material 
significantly increases their surface area, allowing for greater adsorption capacity. 
The interaction between iron oxide and phosphate ions typically occurs via 
chemisorption, where phosphate binds to the surface of iron oxide particles, forming 
strong Fe–O–P bonds.  
Adsorption Mechanism and Equations  
The removal of phosphorus using iron oxide nano bio-adsorbents follows a surface 
adsorption process that can be described by the chemical reaction below  
Fe-OH + H₂PO₄⁻→ Fe-O-PO₄²⁻+ H₂O  
This reaction represents the binding of phosphate ions to the surface of iron oxide 
(Fe₂O₃). The adsorptive capacity of iron oxide is influenced by factors such as pH, 
initial phosphorus concentration, and the presence of competing ions in the water. 
Phosphates typically form inner-sphere complexes with iron hydroxides.  
The high affinity of iron oxides for phosphate ions can be attributed to their ability 
to form stable complexes through surface hydroxyl groups. Various studies have 
demonstrated the efficacy of iron oxide in adsorbing phosphate ions from 

 
15 
 
wastewater, with significant removal efficiencies across a range of operating 
conditions .Fe(OH)₃ + PO₄³⁻ → FePO₄ + 3OH⁻  
Iron oxide bio-adsorbents are especially useful in tackling phosphorus pollution due 
to their rapid kinetics, high adsorption capacities, and the ability to regenerate and 
reuse the adsorbent. Nanoparticles are also more effective in reaching and 
interacting with target pollutants in complex water matrices, such as those found 
in industrial wastewater.  
2.3.2. Factors Affecting Phosphorus Adsorption pH Levels  
The adsorption of phosphorus is highly pH-dependent, with maximum removal 
typically observed in slightly acidic conditions (pH 4-6). At lower pH, the surface 
charge of iron oxides becomes more positive, enhancing the electrostatic attraction 
between the adsorbent and phosphate anions Presence of Competing Ions  
The presence of other anions, such as sulfates or nitrates, can compete with 
phosphate for adsorption sites, potentially reducing the efficiency of phosphorus 
removal.  
Temperature  
Higher temperatures can increase the adsorption rate but may also reduce the 
equilibrium capacity by affecting the adsorbent's structure and the interaction 
strength between the phosphate ions and iron oxides.  
Adsorbent Dosage  
The amount of nano bio-adsorbent used also plays a crucial role in determining the 
efficiency of phosphorus removal. Higher dosages provide more active sites for 

 
16 
 
phosphate binding but can lead to aggregation of nanoparticles, reducing surface 
area and effectiveness  
2.3.2.1. Recent Advances in Phosphorus Removal Technologies  
In recent years, there has been considerable progress in developing hybrid and 
composite materials for phosphorus adsorption. Iron oxide nanoparticles, when 
combined with natural polymers such as chitosan or cellulose, offer enhanced 
removal efficiency due to the synergistic effects of the metal oxide and the polymer 
matrix. These materials not only provide high adsorption capacities but also exhibit 
better stability in wastewater conditions.  
Additionally, advances in the synthesis of magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles allow 
for easy separation of the adsorbent from the treated water, making the process 
more efficient. This magnetic property enables the adsorbent to be recovered and 
reused, reducing operational costs in wastewater treatment plants (Łukasz 
Wujcicki,2023).  
2.3. Wastewater Treatment  
Introduction  
Wastewater treatment is a process designed to remove contaminants from 
wastewater before it is released into the environment. Municipal wastewater 
treatment plants play a critical role in protecting ecosystems by ensuring that 
treated effluent meets regulatory discharge standards before being returned to 
water bodies (Aghalari, 2020). Treatment processes vary but typically involve 
physical, chemical, and biological methods to eliminate organic, chemical, and 
physical pollutants.  

 
17 
 
Adsorption  
Adsorption is a wastewater treatment method in which molecules (adsorbates) 
adhere to the surface of a solid material (adsorbent). This process is widely used to 
remove pollutants from wastewater, particularly at low concentrations. Adsorption 
is favored due to its simplicity and effectiveness, especially in comparison to 
methods such as coagulation and flocculation, which tend to produce large amounts 
of sludge (Tran, 2023). Adsorbents with high affinity for target pollutants, such as 
iron oxide nano bio-adsorbents, can significantly improve the efficiency of 
wastewater treatment, especially in removing nutrients like phosphorus.  
2.3.1. Types of Bio-Adsorbents  
Various types of bio-adsorbents are being developed to enhance wastewater 
treatment, focusing on sustainable and biodegradable materials such as chitosan, 
cellulose, and iron oxide nanoparticles. These materials are advantageous due to 
their large surface area, mechanical strength, and environmental compatibility, 
making them effective in adsorbing contaminants.  
2.3.2. Factors Affecting Adsorption  
Adsorbent Dose  
 The amount of adsorbent used directly affects the adsorption process. An increase 
in adsorbent dosage increases the availability of active sites for pollutant capture, 
leading to higher removal efficiency.  
Contact Time  
 The duration of contact between the adsorbent and the wastewater influences the 
extent of adsorption. Longer contact times generally lead to greater adsorption as 

 
18 
 
more time allows for equilibrium to be reached between the adsorbent and the 
pollutant.  
pH  
The pH of the wastewater plays a critical role in adsorption efficiency, as it affects 
both the adsorbent surface charge and the ionization state of the pollutants. 
Optimal pH levels enhance adsorption by maximizing the interaction between the 
adsorbent and the pollutant.  
Temperature  
Temperature influences the chemical reactions involved in adsorption. Typically, an 
increase in temperature speeds up reaction rates but may also decrease adsorption 
capacity as the adsorbate may desorb from the adsorbent surface.  
2.4. LEGISLATION ON WASTEWATER MANAGEMENT 
Policy and regulatory frameworks are crucial in governing, guiding and maintaining 
wastewater treatment practices. They provide a regulatory framework for 
environmental protection, sustainability, and public health. Standards, protocols 
and guidelines have been set by international organizations such as World Health 
Organization. These standards set bench marks for wastewater treatment and 
discharge, they cover various characteristics including nutrient availability and 
effluent limits. These standards are important as they confirm compliance of 
wastewater treatment plants with environmental and public health standards.  
 

 
19 
 
2.4.1. The United Nations (UN) 
UN works with various member states to develop international guidelines and 
standards for wastewater management. 
• International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 
The International Organization for Standardization sets standards for wastewater 
management aiming at ensuring sustainable wastewater treatment and disposal. ISO 
provides a framework for wastewater management, including determination of the 
wastewater quality. Some of the standards set by ISO that are in line with 
wastewater management include; 
❖ ISO 14001:2015 – Environmental Management Systems – Requirements with 
Guidance for use. It provides the framework for management of 
environmental impacts, treatment and disposal of wastewater. 
❖ ISO 24511:2017 – water quality- this standard provides for determination of 
Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) in wastewater effluent and river water 
using the open reflux method. 
❖ ISO 25649-1:2017-Water quality- this standard provides for the determination 
of the Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) in wastewater effluent and river water 
using closed reflux method. 
2.4.2. African Union (AU) 
The African Union is a regional intergovernmental organization which aims at 
promoting development and cooperation among the various countries in Africa. The 
African Union promotes and supports waste-water management through several 
means which include; 
1. Promotion of regional cooperation 

 
20 
 
The African Union plays a crucial role in promoting regional cooperation on 
wastewater management. It does so by bringing together countries to share ideas, 
experiences and best practices on wastewater management. 
 
 
2. Provision of technical and financial support 
The African Union plays a role in providing both technical and financial support to 
the African countries, enhancing their wastewater management practices and 
infrastructure. Some of which include funding for wastewater treatment plants, new 
technological development for wastewater management among others. 
3. Rising awareness 
The African union promotes awareness about wastewater management practices, 
importance of managing wastewater among others. It does this by organizing 
workshops and conferences which promote best wastewater management practices. 
 
2.4.3. East African Standard 
The aim of the East African Standard is to indicate the quality of the effluent to be 
discharged on land or water bodies, among the several countries that make up the 
East African Community. This is done in order to promote a consistent approach 
towards the prevention of water pollution as per the regulation. Therefore, the 
wastewater to be discharged into the environment (land or water bodies) should be 
free from; 
a) Floating debris and other materials in amounts sufficient to be noticeable and 
that can lead to deterioration of the environment 

 
21 
 
b) Substances that will settle in receiving water bodies and which substances 
can adversely affect aquatic life. 
c) Nutrients such as Nitrogen and Phosphorous in concentrations that promote 
eutrophication of the receiving water bodies with its undesirable effects. 
The wastewater from all municipal and industrial establishments includes but are 
not limited to the ones listed below; 
1. The oil and gas industry from production and refining, including natural 
and petroleum gas 
2. The pulp and paper industry 
3. Pharmaceutical, agrochemical, mining, textile among others 
4. Wastewater that is derived from households, business buildings, 
institutions among others which may contain storm water, ground water 
or surface runoff 
Requirements For Wastewater Discharged on Land and Into Water Bodies 
The East African standard specifies requirements of wastewater discharged 
on land and into water bodies from municipal and industrial activities. 
However, it does not include requirements for hazardous effluents which are 
classified as restricted substances.  
Specific requirements

2.4.4. Uganda at National Level 
Management of waste water in Uganda is a very crucial to protect the environment 
from the adverse impacts that arise from poor management of waste-water. 
Wastewater management in Uganda is regulated by several laws and regulations. 
2.4.5. National Environment Act Cap 153. 
The National Environment Act provides a legal framework for sustainable 
environmental management, establishing an authority as a coordinating, monitoring 
and supervisory body for that purpose. This act establishes NEMA as the principal 

 
23 
 
agency for the management of the environment, providing a range of measures to 
promote effective wastewater management in the Country. 
• Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). This act ensures that all the 
projects, wastewater treatment projects for example, that may have 
significant impacts on the environment undergo an EIA before their approval. 
• Permits and licenses. According to this act, all the entities that discharge 
their effluent into the environment obtain a permit from National 
Environment Management Authority (NEMA). The permit sets various 
standards for effluent discharge and ensures that all the entities meet those 
standards before discharging their effluents into the environment. 
• Environmental Audits. According to this act, individuals and the entities must 
assess the impacts of their activities on the environment including waste-
water management. Therefore, the entities and individuals should always 
conduct environmental audits. 
• Public participation. The act ensures public participation as it requires the 
public to take part in the decision-making processes related to wastewater 
management and other issues of the environment. 
• Fines and penalties. The act imposes fines and penalties to the violators of 
the act, including the individuals or entities who do not improperly dispose of 
their wastewater.  
• Closure of facilities. The government is given power and authority by the act 
to close down facilities that do not adhere to the effluent discharge 
standards. All the facilities, including wastewater management facilities that 
pose a threat to the environment and public health will be closed. 

 
24 
 
2.5. Standards for wastewater discharge according to the water Act, Cap 152

CHAPTER THREE: METHODOLOGY SAMPLE COLLECTION 
3.1. SAMPLING (APHA 1060) 
We implemented the grab sampling method, where samples were collected at a 
single point in different time intervals from specific locations. This technique 
ensures that a snapshot of the water quality is obtained at that specific moment, 
reflecting the effluent’s condition at a given time. Samples were collected three 
times daily over three different days to ensure a representative and comprehensive 
dataset. And this was done in triplicates. It was done when the textile industry was 
still in operation. The first sample was picked at 8:30am, second sample was picked 
at 12:30pm and the third sample was picked at 4:30pm. Care was taken to label 
sampling containers properly and to avoid contamination by rinsing the containers 
with distilled water prior to collection. Preservation of the samples was done by 
storing them in a cooler box to maintain their chemical integrity and prevent 
alterations in concentration during transportation.

3.3. DETERMINATION OF THE PHYSICOCHEMICAL PARAMETERS OF THE 
WASTEWATER EFFLUENT  
3.3.1. Laboratory Analysis 
The laboratory analysis was conducted using the American Public Health 
Association Standard methods (APHA, 1995) and the corresponding equipment used 
for analyzing each parameter is as explained below 
Reagents were prepared such as potassium dichromate solution which is an oxidizing 
agent and silver sulphate solution which is a catalyst.  
The collected wastewater sample was placed in a digestion and the prepared 
reagents which are potassium dichromate solution and silver sulphate solution were 

 
27 
 
added. The vessel is sealed to prevent escape of volatile compounds during the 
reaction. The mixture was then heated at a temperature of about 150-170 degrees 
Celsius for two hours so as to oxidize the organic matter.  
The mixture was cooled to room temperature and excess potassium dichromate 
solution is titrated with ferrous ammonium sulfate which is a standard solution using 
an indicator. The COD of the wastewater sample was then be determined.  
Total phosphorous (APHA standard 4500)   
Reagents for phosphorous analysis were prepared, this included acid solution 
preparation for digestion. to convert all species of phosphorous into ortho-
phosphate.  
A measured volume of the sample was placed in clean test tubes and ammonium 
molybdade added to it. The mixture was mixed thoroughly and then allowed to react 
to form molybdenum blue complex.  
A reducing agent solution was added to form a blue coloration and absorbance of 
the solution at a specific wavelength was measured using a spectrophotometer. A 
calibration curve was then prepared using known concentrations of standard 
phosphate solutions to establish a relationship between absorbance and 
phosphorous concentration.  
The sample absorbance was compared with calibration curve to determine total 
phosphorous concentration. To ensure accuracy, blank samples were used.  pH 
(APHA Standard 4500-H)  
A Portable Hach Multimeter was used to measure the pH after calibrating the 
instrument using a buffer solution. The pH probe was rinsed with distilled water and 

 
28 
 
inserted into the wastewater sample to take readings. Accurate pH measurement is 
crucial for understanding the acidity or alkalinity of the wastewater, which 
influences treatment processes and effluent discharge quality.  
Turbidity (APHA standard 2130)  
Turbidity was measured using a turbidimeter. The sample was thoroughly mixed and 
transferred to a clean container before being placed in the device. The turbidimeter 
measured the amount of light scattered by the suspended particles in the sample, 
providing the turbidity in Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU). Calibration of the 
turbidimeter with standards ensured accuracy and consistency of readings.  
Total Suspended Solids (APHA standard 2540)  
The water sample was mixed thoroughly and then filtered through a weighed 
standard glass-fiber filter. The residue that is retained on the filter was then oven 
dried at a temperature of 103 -105 degrees Celsius to a constant weight.  
The increase in the weight of the filter paper is the total suspended solid and it was 
obtained by getting the difference between the weight of filter paper and the 
weight of filter paper plus the residue in mg/l.

3.3.2. ASSESSING THE PERFORMANCE OF IRON OXIDE AND SILICA IN 
PHOSPHOROUS REMOVAL FROM WASTEWATER. 
3.3.2.1. Material Acquisition and Preparation 
Iron-oxide bio adsorbent is a combination of iron-oxide and silica. The rice husk from 
which the silica will be extracted is obtained from a rice milling factory in Kayunga 
town, Mukono. 
3.3.2.2. Iron-Oxide Particles 
Steel waste was obtained from steel scrap, its crushed and grinded into fine particles 
using a grinder. The steel waste is washed with water or acid solutions to remove 
impurities such as oils, dirt. The steel waste is then treated with hydrochloric acid 

 
30 
 
to dissolve the iron into a solution which contains iron ions. The resulting product is 
iron chloride solution and the undissolved residues are filtered out. 
      Fe + 2HCl     
      FeCl2 + H2 
Ferrous chloride solution was oxidized by adding hydrogen peroxide to give ferric 
chloride solution.  
2FeCl2 + H2O2 + HCl    
  2FeCl3 + 2H2O 
Distinguishing between ferric chloride and ferrous chloride was done using aqueous 
ammonia, a pale green precipitate of ferrous hydroxide was formed and a reddish-
brown precipitate of ferric hydroxide was also formed. 
3.2.2.3. Preparation of Rice Husk 
The rice husk contains silica which is to be extracted and used. The rice husk was 
washed to remove impurities and then dried at a temperature of about 100oC until 
the moisture was completely removed. 
The dried rice husk was subjected to controlled burning in a furnace at a 
temperature of 500-700oC to obtain rice husk ash which is rich in silica. The rice 
husk ash was grinded when collected from the furnace and sieved through the 
0.075mm sieve to ensure uniformity in particle size. It was then collected and kept 
in a polythene bag which was free from damage. 
 The rice husk ash was treated with 1 mole of sodium hydroxide under stirring of 
80oC to produce sodium silicate. The solution was neutralized using HCl to 
precipitate silica which was then filtered, washed and dried. The X-ray Fluorescence 
technique was used to identify and quantify the different elements in the rice husk 
ash under an X-ray Fluorescence Spectrometer.  

 
31 
 
To obtain iron-oxide nano bio adsorbent, the extracted silica was combined with 
iron-oxide nano particles by placing both in water and stirring. The resulting mixture 
was heated in a muffle furnace at a temperature of 500oC to form iron-oxide nano 
bio adsorbent. 
3.2.2.4. Optimum Dose Rate 
Effluent samples were tested using various doses of the iron-oxide bio-adsorbent. In 
a jar test, increasing amounts of the adsorbent were added to separate samples, 
while one jar acted as a control. Samples underwent rapid and slow stirring, 
followed by a 30-minute settling period. The treated samples were analyzed for 
parameters such as turbidity, TSS, COD, and total phosphorus. The optimal dose rate 
was determined by assessing the percentage removal of nutrients. 
The values that were obtained after the use of iron-oxide bio-adsorbent were 
denoted, D2 and the initial values of the wastewater effluent were denoted D1. 
Therefore, the percentage removal of the iron-oxide nano bio adsorbent was 
obtained using the formula, 
Percentage removal = (D1 - D2)/ D1 x 100%  
Batch adsorption  
A batch adsorption test is a laboratory experiment which is used when evaluating 
the adsorption capacity of the material to be used for contaminant or pollutant 
removal. 
Procedure 
1. A known amount of the iron oxide bio-adsorbent was added to a known volume of 
the wastewater effluent and it was thoroughly mixed. 

 
32 
 
2. The mixture was then allowed to settle for a contact time of; 30, 60 and 120 mins 
3. At the end of each predetermined time, the concentration of the pollutant that 
remained in the solution after settling were determined using the APHA Standards. 
4. The removal efficiency of the iron oxide nano bio-adsorbent was done by subtracting 
the pollutant concentration in the remaining solution after settling from the initial 
pollutant concentration in the solution and then dividing by the initial pollutant 
concentration. 
5. The procedure was repeated for different amounts of iron oxide nano bio adsorbent 
to determine the optimum dosage. 
COLUMN EXPERIMENT 
Column experiment was performed by using a packed bed using a 300mm length of 
the plastic column having an internal diameter of 80mm and the iron oxide-silica 
composite was packed inside the column 
The column was layered with a support material, glass wool upon loading the 
adsorbent to prevent loss of the adsorbent during operation.  The bed height was 
varied to 60mm, 80,100 and 150mm 
PROTOTYPE DESIGN 
The prototype design is a multi-stage wastewater treatment system utilizing iron 
oxide for adsorption and silica for filtration. The process begins with raw water 
collection in the first bucket, where wastewater is held temporarily before 
treatment. A controlled valve regulates the flow of wastewater into the next stage, 
ensuring a steady and manageable treatment process. The second stage, the 
adsorption unit, consists of a second bucket containing iron oxide, which is 

 
33 
 
responsible for removing phosphates and organic pollutants, including chemical 
oxygen demand (COD). To enhance the adsorption efficiency, a motor stirs the 
mixture continuously for 60 minutes, allowing maximum interaction between the 
iron oxide and the contaminants. Once the adsorption process is complete, a valve 
releases the partially treated water into the next phase. 
The filtration unit is designed using a cut jerrican filled with silica to a depth of 50 
cm. This stage is crucial for removing suspended solids (Total Suspended Solids - TSS) 
and reducing turbidity, thereby improving the clarity and overall quality of the 
treated water. Silica acts as a physical filter, trapping fine particles and ensuring 
that the effluent is free from visible impurities. The final stage involves the 
collection of treated water in a separate container for testing and evaluation. This 
ensures that the treatment process has effectively reduced pollutants and improved 
water quality before potential reuse or safe discharge. Your prototype demonstrates 
a simple yet effective approach to wastewater treatment, integrating adsorption 
and filtration techniques for efficient pollutant removal. 
NB: BOTH THE CONTACT TIME AND OPTIMUM DOSE ARE OBTAINED FROM THE BATCH 
EXPERIMENTS.

The values above got from the laboratory tests done on the wastewater effluent of 
sunbelt textile industry show that the water is highly contaminated. This shows the 
presence of COD  because the average mean value is also large which is 233.11 mg/L 
with a standard deviation of ± 29.1. 
The chemical oxygen demand (COD) in the wastewater from the textile company 
exhibited a notable diurnal variation. COD, a measure of the amount of organic 
pollutants in water, averaged 236.7 ± 29.1 in the morning, increased to 273.3 ± 38.6 
in the afternoon, and then decreased to 189.3 ± 4.04 in the evening. This fluctuation 
likely reflects changes in the factory's operations and wastewater treatment 
processes throughout the day. Increased production activity during the afternoon 
could lead to a higher concentration of pollutants in the wastewater, thus elevating 
the COD levels. Conversely, reduced activity in the evening may result in lower COD. 
Additionally, the efficiency of the wastewater treatment plant might vary 
throughout the day, potentially struggling to handle peak loads in the afternoon or 
experiencing fluctuations in factors like temperature or chemical balance that 
impact treatment effectiveness. Variations in the composition of the influent 
wastewater, including the types and amounts of pollutants discharged, could also 
contribute to the observed COD changes. While less probable, minor inconsistencies 
in sampling or the influence of diurnal biological activity within the treatment 
system might also play a role.

The values above got from the laboratory tests done on the wastewater effluent of 
sunbelt textile industry show that the water is highly contaminated. This above 
results show the presence of total suspended solids because the average mean value 
is large which is 329.88 mg/L with a standard deviation of ± 98.33. 
The mean is 343.3 ±98.3 in the morning and it increased to 440 ±168.0 in the 
afternoon and reduced to 395.3 ±13.6 in the evening.

Figure 4 : total phosphates variation with time  
 
The values above got from the laboratory tests done on the wastewater effluent of 
sunbelt textile industry show that the water is highly contaminated. This shows the 
presence of total Phosphorous because the average mean value is also large which 
is 30.88mg/L with a standard deviation of ± 1.5. 
The mean is 30.06 ±1.52 in the morning and it increased to 35.67 ±3.5 in the 
afternoon and reduced to 26.9±1.3 in the evening.
