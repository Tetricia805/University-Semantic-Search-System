Direct Method
Using the similarities of triangles,
f(b) −f(a)
b −a
= f(c) −f(a)
c −a
f(b) −f(a) = (b −a)
(c −a)[f(c) −f(a)]
thus
f(b) = f(a) + (b −a)
(c −a) [f(c) −f(a)]

and
b = a +

1.) Find the distance traveled when t = 2.3 hrs.
Then a = 2, c = 3, & b = 2.3
f(a) = 39, f(c) = 67, & f(b)?
f(b) = f(a) + (b −a)
(c −a) [f(c) −f(a)] = 39 + (2.3 −2)
(3 −2) (67 −39) = 47.4
2.) The time taken when the distance traveled is 80 miles.
Then a = 3, c = 4, & b =?
f(a) = 67, f(c) = 100, & f(b) = 80
b = a +

(c −a) = 3 + (80 −67)
(100 −67)(4 −1) = 3.39394
Example 5.1.2
The bus stages along Kampala-Jinja are 10 km apart. An express bus trav-
eling between the two towns only stops at these stages except in case of an emergency when its
permitted to stop at a point between the two stages.
The fares (fee) between the first, second, third and fourth stages from Jinja are Sh 110, Sh 150, Sh 185
and Sh 200 respectively. On a certain day, a passenger paid to travel from Jinja in the bus
upto the fourth stage, but he fell sick and had to be left on a health center 33 km from Jinja.
1.) Given that he was refunded money for the distance he had not traveled, find the approximate
amount of money he received.

Then a = 30, c = 40, & b = 33
f(a) = 185, f(c) = 200, & f(b)?
f(b) = f(a) + (b −a)
(c −a) [f(c) −f(a)] = 185 + (200 −185)
(40 −30) (33 −30) = 189.5
The journey he had moved costed him Sh 189.5, thus he was refunded
200 −189.5 = 10.5 shillings
2.) Another person who had only Sh.165 was allowed to board a bus but would be left at a
point worth his money, how far from Jinja would he be left.
Then a = 20, c = 30, & b =?
f(a) = 150, f(c) = 185, & f(b) = 165

Application
Linear interpolation is often used to fill the gaps in a table. Suppose you have a table listing
the population of some country in 1970, 1980, 1990 and 2000, and that you want to estimate
the population in 1994. Linear interpolation gives you an easy way to do this.
The basic operation of linear interpolation between two values is so commonly used in computer
graphics that it is sometimes called a lerp in the jargon of computer graphics. The term can
be used as a verb or noun for the operation. e.g. ”Bresenham’s algorithm lerps incrementally
between the two endpoints of the line.”
Lerp operations are built into the hardware of all modern computer graphics processors. They
are often used as building blocks for more complex operations: for example, a bilinear interpo-
lation can be accomplished in three lerps. Because this operation is cheap, it’s also a good way
to implement accurate lookup tables with quick lookup for smooth functions without having
too many table entries.
5.1.2
History
Linear interpolation has been used since antiquity for filling the gaps in tables, often with
astronomical data. It is believed that it was used in the Seleucid Empire (last three centuries
BC) and by the Greek astronomer and mathematician Hipparchus (second century BC). A
description of linear interpolation can be found in the Almagest (second century AD) of Ptolemy.
5.1.3
Extensions
In demanding situations, linear interpolation is often not accurate enough (since not all points
can be approximated to be on a straight line). In that case, it can be replaced by polynomial
interpolation or spline interpolation.
Linear interpolation can also be extended to bilinear interpolation for interpolating functions
of two variables. Bilinear interpolation is often used as a crude anti-aliasing filter. Similarly,
trilinear interpolation is used to interpolate functions of three variables. Other extensions of
linear interpolation can be applied to other kinds of mesh such as triangular and tetrahedral
meshes.

5.2. LAGRANGE INTERPOLATION
5.2
Lagrange Interpolation
We may know the value of a function f at a set of points x1, x2, . . . , xN. How do we estimate
the value of the function at any point x∗; how do we compute f(x∗). In general this is done
by developing a smooth curve though the points (x1, f(x1)), (x2, f(x2)), ...(xN, f(xN)).
Lagrange interpolation is a way to pass a polynomial of degree N −1 through N points.
Lagrange polynomials are the interpolating polynomials that equal zero in all given points,
save one. Say, given points x1, x2, . . . , xN, Lagrange’s polynomial number k is the product
Pk(x) = (x −x1)
(xk −x1) · (x −x2)
(xk −x2) · · · (x −xk−1)
(xk −xk−1) · (x −xk+1)
(xk −xk+1) · · · (x −xN)
(xk −xN)
such that Pk(xk) = 1 and Pk(xj) = 0, for j different from k. In terms of Lagrange’s polynomials
the polynomial interpolation through the points (x1, y1), (x2, y2), . . . , (xN, yN) could be defined
simply as
P(x) = y1P1(x) + y2P2(x) + ... + yNPN(x)
Definition 5.2.1
Polynomial interpolation is a method of constructing a function and esti-
mating values at non-tabular points between x0 and xn.
5.2.0.1
Alternatively
Let f(x) be a continuous function on [a, b], such that
f(xk) = f(xk),
k = 0, 1, ..., n,
with xk ∈[a, b]. We call the set of points {xk} tabular points (or interpolating points), while
the set of values {f(xk)} are called the tabular values of f(x). We seek for a polynomial of
degree n, such that
Pn(xk) = f(xk), for k = 0, 1, 2, . . . n.
(5.3)
Such a polynomial is called Lagrange’s interpolation polynomial.
However, the process of
calculating f(x), x ∈[a, b], x ̸= xk ∀k from 0 to n, is called interpolation.
We now proceed to derive a formula for Pn(x). However, there is need to introduce some key
definitions.
Definition 5.2.2
Let {Dk : k = 0, 1, ..., n} be any set of numbers. We define the products;
n
Y
k=0
Dk = D0.D1...Dn
and
n
Y
j=0
j̸=k
Dk = D0.D1...Dj−1.Dj+1...Dn
.
This definition is important in the following defining equation for Lagrange’s interpolating
polynomial.

The Lagrange’s interpolation polynomial Pn(x) is given by,
Pn(x) =
n
X
k=0
Lk(x)f(xk)
(5.4)
with
Lk(x) =
n
Y
j=0
j̸=k
 x −xj
xk −xj

(5.5)
Proof: Because Pn(x) is of degree n, we may write
Lk(x) = αk
n
Y
j=0
j̸=k
,
αk constant.
For Pn(x) to satisfy equation (5.3) we must have,
Lk(xj) = δkj( Kroneker
delta)
with
δkj =



1,
j = k
0,
j ̸= k
(5.6)
With the condition (1.3) we have,
αk =

j=0
j̸=k
(xk −xj)
This completes the proof.

Linear Interpolating Polynomials
When n = 1, in equation (5.4) we have the polynomial as
P1(x) =
1
X
k=0
Lk(x)f(xk)

But Lk(x) =

j=0
j̸=k

therefore L0(x) =
 x −x1
x0 −x1

L1(x) =
 x −x0
x1 −x0

Thus,
P1(x) =
 x −x1
x0 −x1

f(x0) +
 x −x0
x1 −x0

f(x1)
(5.7)
Which is known as Lagrange’s interpolating polynomial of degree one, popularly known as
Linear interpolating polynomial.
Example 5.2.1
Construct a linear interpolation polynomial for the data,
x

f(x)

Hence interpolate f(0.5).

P1(x) =
 x −x1
x0 −x1

f(x0) +
 x −x0
x1 −x0

f(x1)

0 −1

f(0) +

1 −0

f(1)
= (1 −x)(1.0000) + (x)(2.7183)
= 1.0000 + 1.7183x
Hence
P1(0.5) = 1.0000 + (1.7183)(0.5)
= 1.0000 + 0.8592
= 1.8592
In fact the data in this particular example describes the graph of f(x) = ex on [0, 1].

then
L0(x) = (x −x1)(x −x2)

L1(x) = (x −x0)(x −x2)
(x1 −x0)(x1 −x2)
L2(x) = (x −x0)(x −x1)
(x2 −x0)(x2 −x1)
Thus, we have,
P2(x) = (x −x1)(x −x2)
(x0 −x1)(x0 −x2)f(x0) + (x −x0)(x −x2)
(x1 −x0)(x1 −x2)f(x1) + (x −x0)(x −x1)
(x2 −x0)(x2 −x1)f(x2)
Which is called a quadratic interpolating polynomial. Generally they are better interpolating
polynomials than the linear ones.
Example 5.2.4
You are given that, f(0) = −2, f(2) = 4, and f(3) = 10. Find a Lagrange
polynomial of degree 2 that fits the data.
Since x0 = 0,
x1 = 2 and x2 = 3 therefore f(x0) = −2,
f(x1) = 4,
f(x2) = 10.
But
P2(x) = L0f(x0) + L1f(x1) + L2f(x2)

5.2.5
Uniqueness of Lagrange Interpolating Polynomials
Theorem 5.2.2
Lagrange’s interpolation polynomial Pn(x) is unique.
Proof:
The proof proceeds by contradiction. Let Pn(x) and Qn(x) be two different
polynomials which interpolate f(x) over the set of points {xk : k = 0, 1, . . . , n} which
belong to the interval [a, b], then
Pn(xk) = Q(xk) = f(xk), for k = 0, 1, 2, . . . , n.
Lets define,
r(x) = P(x) −Q(x) ∀x ∈[a, b],
then r(x) has at most degree n. Since r(xk) = 0 for k = 0, 1, 2, . . . , n, it has n + 1
distinct zeros in [a, b]. This contradicts the fundamental law of algebra which states
that a non-zero polynomial of degree n cannot have more than n zeros and so Pn(x)
and Qn(x) are the same polynomials.
■
Note 5.2.1
The uniqueness means that you cannot find any other polynomial of the same
degree which can interpolate the data.

Error analysis in Lagrange’s interpolation
Truncation errors in Lagrange interpolation
We assume that f(xk) ≡f(xk),
k = 0, 1, 2, . . . , n are exact and we consider the truncation
error e(x) = f(x) −Pn(x) for x ∈[a, b] and Pn(x) the Lagrange polynomial of degree n as
defined in earlier.
Apart from the fact that e(xk) = 0, for k = 0, 1, 2, . . . , n with xk ∈[a, b], we can say nothing
more about e(x) for any x ̸= xk.
In addition we have that f(x) has at least n+1 continuous derivatives on [a, b], then it is possible
to express e(x) in terms of f n+1(x). We now state without proof two necessary Lemmas.
Lemma 5.2.1
Given
qn+1(x) =
n
Y
k=0
(x −xk),
x ∈[a, b]
of degree (n + 1),
q′
n+1(x) is of degree n such that
q′
n+1(xj) =
n
X
k=0
k̸=j
(xj −xk)
Lemma 5.2.2
Let a function g(x) be defined on [a, b]. Let {Sk : k = 0, 1, . . . , n} be a set of distinct points
each belonging to [a, b], with S0 < S1 < S2 < . . . < Sn. Suppose that:
(i) g(n)(x)(n ≥integer) is continuous on [S0, Sn].
(ii) g(Sk) = 0, k = 0, 1, . . . , n.
Then there is at least a number ξ ∈(S0, Sn) such that , g(n)(ξ) = 0
Lemma 5.2.3
The expression in the truncation error e(x) is given by:
e(x) =
n
Y
k=0
(x −xk)f (n+1)(ξ)
(n + 1)!
with ξ = ξ(x) and mink(x, xk) < ξ < maxk(x, xk)
Proof
For points x = xk,
k = 0, 1, 2, . . . , n, the theorem is trivially satisfied.
Suppose x ̸= xk, we define
q(t) =
n
Y
k=0
(t −xk)
and
g(t) = f(t) −Pn(t) −q(t)
q(x)(f(x) −Pn(x)) for t, x ∈[a, b].
Page 138 of 196
ssebuliba & ddumba
numerical analysis i

5.2. LAGRANGE INTERPOLATION
Now g(xk) = 0,
k = 0, 1, 2, . . . n Also g(x) = 0 (x ̸= xk). So for each fixed x ̸= xk, g(t) has
n + 2 distinct zeros.
Since g(t) satisfies all the conditions of Lemma 1.2, we deduce that there is a number ξ such
that g(n+1)(ξ) = 0 where
min
k (x, xk) < ξ < max
k (x, xk).
Now
g(n+1)(t) = f (n+1)(t) −P (n+1)
n
(t) −(f(x) −Pn)q(n+1)(t)
q(x)
= f (n+1)(t) −(n + 1)!(f(x) −Pn(x))
q(x)
Since
P n+1(t) = 0
and
qn+1(t) = (n + 1)!
The result of the theorem follows when t = ξ.
Example 5.2.9
Using two point linear interpolation of ex on [0, 1] therefore
ex = x(x −1)
2
eξ,
ξ ∈(0, 1).
But x(x −1) is maximum or minimum at x = 1
2 with maximum absolute value equal to 1. So
e(x) has a maximum value equal to e
8 = 0.3398 (4dp)
5.2.7
Rounding errors in Lagrange polynomials
Errors known as rounding errors are usually introduced in the functional evaluation of f(xk).
Suppose rounding errors Ek occur in the data f(xk) = f(xk),
k = 0, 1, 2, . . . , n respectively.
Let P(x) and P ⋆(x) denote, respectively, the interpolating polynomials using exact and inexact
data.
Thus,
Pn(x) =
n
X
k=0
(f(xk) + Ek)Lk(x)
P ⋆
n(x) =
n
X
k=0
f(xk)Lk(x)
so |Pn(x) −P ⋆
n(x)| ≤
n
X
k=0
|Ek||Lk(x)|
Which is the rounding error bound. If data was rounded to m decimal places, then the absolute
maximum error is |Ek| ≤1
2 × 10−m for each k = 0, 1, . . . , n.
Example 5.2.10
Find the rounding error bound in linear interpolation, of ex for x ∈[0, 1],
when data were rounded to four digits.

Solution
|P1(x) −P1 ∗(x)| ≤1
210−4(|L0(x)| + |L1(x)|)
Now,
L0(x) = 1 −x
and
L1(x) = x
and so on
[0, 1], |L0(x)| + |L1(x)| = 1 −x + x = 1.
Thus,
|P1(x) −P ⋆
1(x)| ≤1
210−4,
which says that the effect of rounding errors in the data, on P1(x) maintains the same maximum
magnitude.

(∗)
then
F(xi) = f(xi) −Pn(xi) = 0,
i = 0, 1, 2, . . . n
Further
F(x) = f(x) −Pn(x) −f(x) + Pn(x) = 0,
∀x ∈(a, b),
x ̸= xi,
necessarily and i = 0, 1, 2, . . . n.
Thus, F(t) vanishes in (a, b) at n + 2 distinct points. On applying Rolle’s theorem repeatedly
we conclude that there exists c ∈(a, b) such that, F (n+1)(c) = 0.
Differentiating equation (∗) (n + 1) times and putting t = c, gives,
f(x) = Pn(x) +

Describe a general procedure for finding a polynomial function of degree n that passes through

Note 5.2.5
Lagrange’s interpolation formula has the disadvantage that the degree of the
approximating polynomial must be chosen at the outset; an alternative approach is discussed in
the next Step. Thus, Lagrange’s formula is mainly of theoretical interest for us here; in passing,
we mention that there are some important applications of this formula beyond the scope of this
book - for example, the construction of basis functions to solve differential equations using a
spectral (discrete ordinate) method.

5.2. LAGRANGE INTERPOLATION
Note 5.2.8
The identity
n
X
k=0
Lk(x) = 1
(established by setting f(x) = 1) may be used as a check. Note also that with n = 1 we recover
the linear interpolation formula:
P1(x) = L0(x)f(x0) + L1(x)f(x1)
= (x −x1)
(x0 −x1)f(x0) + (x −x0)
(x1 −x0)f(x1)
= f(x0) + (x −x0)
(x1 −x0)[f(x1) −f(x0)]
Example 5.2.14
Use Lagrange’s interpolation formula to find the interpolating polynomial
P3(x) through the points (0, 3), (1, 2), (2, 7), and (4, 59) and then find the approximate value of
P3(3).

5.2. LAGRANGE INTERPOLATION
Consequently f(3) ≈P(3) = 33 −2(3) + 3 = 24, However, note that, if the explicit form of
the interpolating polynomial were not required, one would proceed to evaluate P3(x) for some
value of x directly from the factored forms of Lk(x). Thus, in order to evaluate P3(3), one has
L0(3) =
(x −x1)(x −x2)(x −x3)
(x0 −x1)(x0 −x2)(x0 −x3) = (3 −1)(3 −2)(3 −4)
(0 −1)(0 −2)(0 −4) = 1

Exercise 5.2.3
Given that f(−2) = 46, f(−1) = 4, f(1) = 4, f(3) = 156, and f(4) = 484,
use Lagrange’s interpolation formula to estimate the value of f(0).
