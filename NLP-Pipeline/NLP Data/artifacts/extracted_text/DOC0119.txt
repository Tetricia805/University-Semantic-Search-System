ABSTRACT 
This study was based on an analysis of the effect of service quality on customer 
retention in commercial banks. It focused on critically examining the following 
objectives; (1) To find out the factors that determine service quality in commercial 
banks; (ii) To find out ways of managing service quality in commercial banks; (iii) To 
determine the relationship between service quality and customer retention in 
commercial banks. 
 The study used a descriptive cross sectional survey design which included both 
qualitative and quantitative methods of data collection. The quantitative method was 
used to collect numerical data in form of numbers representing particular facts or 
measurement which helped the researcher to obtain information from respondents in 
depth. While the qualitative method explored a wide array of dimensions like the 
texture and leave of everyday life, the understanding and experiences of the research 
participants and the significance of the meaning they generate. 
 After conducting the study, findings revealed that service quality and customer 
retention both go hand in hand and this meant that Stanbic bank should improve on 
their service quality and implement more efficient management systems because the 
higher the service quality the higher the customer retention in the bank. And from 
the findings of the study and the conclusions drawn, the researcher came up with 
recommendations to ensure that management of service quality is emphasized and 
these as included; more training of workers in order to improve their knowledge about 
work and service delivery 1; Good customer care to maintain and expand the market 
reach; Physical facility extensions in order to create space for offering quality 
services to customers with no congestion among others.

CHAPTER ONE 
1.1 Introduction 
This chapter gives an over view of the research, background of commercial banking in 
general and Stanbic bank in particular, it also identifies the problem leading to the 
research and the resulting objectives, research significances and limitations. 
1.1 Background of the Study 
During the past two decades, structural and technological factors have significantly 
changed the banking environment throughout the world (Angur 1999). In the changing 
economy, Service quality as a critical measure of organizational performance 
continues to compel the attention of banking institution and remains at the fore front 
of service marketing literature and practice (Lasser 2000). According to Zethiaml & 
Bitner (2003),”service quality is a focused evaluation that reflects the customer’s 
perception of specific dimensions of service which are reliability, responsiveness, 
assurance, empathy, tangibles, and satisfaction on the other hand is more inclusive 
and influenced by perceptions of product quality and price as well as situational and 
personal factors. According to Dahaner (1997), the interest is largely driven by the 
realization that higher service quality results into customer’s satisfaction and loyalty, 
greater willingness to recommend someone else, reduction in complaints and 
improved customer retention rates. Undoubtedly owing to the belief that delivery of 
high service quality is a must for attaining customer satisfaction and the number of 
other desirable behavior out comes today, banks that offer good service quality 
create good client relationship In order to create it the organization strives to offer 
the best it can to its clients and which translates in high customer retention because 
of the exception care and concern the organization will have for its clients.(Cronin, & 
Taylor (1992)). This minimizes as much as possible the migration of its clients to its 
competitors in other words showing the impact service quality has on customer, 
retention in commercial banks. However, due to the inconsistencies in bank balances 
of customers, long lines in the banks in order to access their services have strongly 

2 
 
affected the quality of service offered by commercial banks (Aladwani). Therefore the 
researcher intends to investigate and find out the effect of service quality on 
customer retention in commercial banks putting into consideration Stanbic bank, 
Mukono branch. 
1.3  
Statement of the Problem 
Commercial banks offer a wide range of services to their customers and strive to close 
the gap between what the customers are offered and what they expect to be offered 
like money transfer services, introduction of ATMs in order to ease access to money at 
all times.  
However customers are dissatisfied with the services rendered as according to 
(www.stanbicbank.co.ug/news) indicates different customer complaints regarding 
inconsistencies on their bank balances, long lines. Upon this background the 
researcher intends to carry out a research on service quality and customer retention 
considering Stanbic bank, Mukono branch, as the case study 
1.4   Purpose of the Study

CHAPTER TWO 
LITERATURE REVIEW 
2.0 Introduction 
This chapter provides a critical review of the theoretical frame work, related 
literature on customer retention, service, quality, importance of service quality, the 
factors that determine service quality and literature summary. 
2.1 Theoretical Frame Work 
Servqual Model. 
Despite several models being identified in the literature for measuring service quality, 
SERVQUAL model — developed by Parasuraman et al., (1985),SERVQUAL is a multi-
item scale which stands for service quality, remains the most often used approach for 
measuring service quality. It is the instrument which is predominantly used to 
measure customers’ perception of service quality. The model is most acknowledged 
and applied in a variety of industries. Originally, the model provided a list of ten 
determinants of service quality: access, communication, competence, courtesy, 
credibility, reliability, responsiveness, security, understanding and tangibles. Later 
reviews merged correlated variables and reduced the determinants to five 
consolidated dimensions, namely tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, assurance and 
empathy as the instruments for measuring service quality (Parasuraman et a!., 1988; 
Zeithaml et al., 1990). The simplified model is simple and has been useful for 
quantitatively assessing customers experience in service. 
2.2 Customer Retention Explained 
Customer retention refers to the ability of a company to retain its existing customers 
and encourage repeat purchases or continued engagement over an extended period of 
time. In a competitive marketplace, customer retention is essential for long term 
profitability and sustainable growth. 

6 
 
Customer defection is a problem and customer retention an opportunity in both 
manufacturing and service industries and service quality begins and ends with the 
customer (Ross 1995). This entails that any company interested in retaining customers 
must focus on customers 
Customer retention as a concept draws strength from relationship marketing and 1s a 
separation from customer attraction, which is inclined towards transactional 
marketing. Customer retention is the act of keeping customers resulting from service 
quality and customer satisfaction (Ross 1995 
Kottler (2000) argues that customer retention is an important phenomenon because it 
has a bearing on costs and profitability over time. Sasser (1990) also supports this 
argument. Comparatively, customer acquisition requires substantial skills in lead 
generation, lead qualification, and account conversion. Consequently, it is not enough 
to attract new customers; the company must keep them. As a result he recommends 
four steps to reducing the defection rate (the rate at which the company loses 
customers):  
• The company must define and measure its retention rate. 
 • The company must distinguish the causes of customer attrition and identify those 
that can be managed better. 
 • The company needs to estimate how much profit it loses when it loses customers. 
 • The company needs to figure out how much it would cost to reduce the defection 
rate. 
2.3 Service 
 Kotler (2000) defines a service as any activity or benefit that one party can offer to 
another that is essentially intangible and doesn’t result in the ownership of anything. 
Payne (1998) asserts that production may or may not be tied to physical product. 
Service 
is 
characterized 
by 
intangibility, 
heterogeneity 
inseparability 
and 
perishability. In my view the services offered and the service providers who are the 

7 
 
banks are inseparable in the buyers mind and must meet individual customer needs 
for higher customer retention. 
 Cowell (1984) refers to a service as an activity separately identified that is not tied 
to a sale of a product or any other services but produces want or satisfaction. In other 
words, a service must be able to maintain the long term clients of the bank. 
According to Lexington (1990) service refers to the activity or a series of activities of 
more or less intangible nature that normally but not necessarily take place in 
interactions between customer and service employees and! or physical resources and! 
or systems of the service provider which are provided as solutions to customer 
problems 
2.4 Quality 
 Mahuda (2006) asserts that quality is the degree to which a product or service 
satisfies a customer’s requirements or expectations, Marcourse (2003) defines quality 
as satisfying customer expectation. This is in line with what Kotler (2000) asserted 
that quality is “freedom from defects” and that it begins with customer needs and 
ends with customer satisfaction. According to Balunywa, (1995) quality means 
attributes of a product or a service. 
 Quality can be graded in terms of good and poor quality. However according to the 
research done the services provided by commercial banks have to be of good quality 
to retain its loyal clients. 1-lorward (2005) defines quality as a predictability degree 
of uniformity and dependability at low cost and suited to the market. To the 
researcher’s understanding quality is an expectation of customers on what 
commercial banks should offer in terms of excellence and superiority. 
2.6 Service quality 
 According to Kotler (2014), service quality means understanding customer’s needs 
and identifying ways to meet and exceed them. It is orientation of all resources and 
all people in the organization towards customer satisfaction. Furthermore in the 
researcher’s view service quality has a direct impact on performance and hence 
customer satisfaction and retention in commercial banks. 

8 
 
 Payne (1998).States that perceived service quality is a measure of performance and 
that a quality of the service is categorized into major components, which include 
technical and functional quality of service. He highlights the nature of quality of 
assessment and influences the corporate image of banks in comparison with its 
competitors.  
Marsh (1980) emphasizes the fact that service quality is the platform of which retail 
banking builds its business thus politeness, professionalism, efficiency, general 
attitudes and even the way the staff is dressed, play a role in convincing the public 
that the bank provides quality service. In other words in the researcher’s view 
attracting new customers and retaining the old ones. 
2.6 What are the factors that influence service quality in commercial banks.  
Different factors or dimensions of service quality were identified by Valerie.& 
Zeithrnal (1998) studying various service categories such as retail banking, long 
distance telephone services, security brokerages and credit card institutions. These 
factors are explained below;  
2.6.1 Reliability  
The reliability and consistency of performance of service facilities, goods and staff is 
seen as important (Johnston, 1997). This includes punctual customer. According to 
Fitzsimmons and Fitzsimrnons (2001), reliability accurately with error free.  
2.6.2 Responsiveness 
 Johnston (1997) describes responsiveness as the speed and timeliness of service 
delivery. This includes the speed of through put and the ability of the waiting and 
queuing time; Fitzsimrnons and Fitzsimrnons (2001) argue that when the customer is 
kept waiting for no apparent reason creates unnecessary negative perception of 
quality. Conversely, the ability for the bank of recover quickly when service fails and 
exhibit professionalism will also create very positive perception of quality. 
 

9 
 
2.6.3 Empathy  
According to Chase et al. (2001), empathy is the provision caring, individualized 
attention to customers. Fitzsimmons and Fitzsimmons (2001) posit that empathy 
includes approach ability, sensitivity, and effort to understand the customer’s needs. 
Johnston 1997 describes empathy as the ability to make the customer feel welcome, 
particularly by the contact staff. 
2.6.4 Tangibles  
The tangibles encompass the appearance of the company representatives, facilities, 
materials, and equipment as well as communication materials. The condition of the 
physical surroundings is seen as tangible evidence of care and attention to detail 
exhibited by the service provider (Fitzsimrnons and Fitzsimmons, 2001). Davis et a! 
(2003) summarizes tangible as the physical evidence of the service 
2.7 Literature Summary  
This part of the study summarizes the information as researched by the past scholars 
by way of definitions. Service is defined as an intangible and tangible activity or 
benefit that one party can offer to another that essentially may not result in the 
ownership of anything however creating want or satisfaction. On the other hand 
quality is the degree of satisfaction of customers’ requirements or expectations.

CHAPTER THREE 
METHODOLOGY 
3.0 Introduction  
This chapter focuses on the methodology. It shows the whole process followed when 
processing and analyzing data. This includes research design, study population, 
sample size, data collection methods and instrument, procedures of data collection, 
data sources, validity and reliability of research tools, data processing and analysis, 
limitations of the study. 
3.1 Research Design 
 The researcher used a descriptive cross sectional survey design. A cross sectional 
survey deals with one part of the population at a time. It included both qualitative 
and quantitative methodology of data collection (Maicibi 2000). 
 Quantitative method was used to collect numerical data in form of numbers 
representing particular facts or measurement Wangusa (2007) which helped the 
researcher to obtain information from respondents in depth. 
 Mason (2002) indicated that qualitative research, the researcher is able to explore a 
wide array of dimensions like the texture and leave of everyday life, the 
understanding and experiences of the research participants and the significance of 
the meaning they generate. 
3.2 Study Population 
The target population was from four departments namely; accounting department, 
human resource management department, finance department and marketing 
department, the researcher used purposive sampling method 
 
 
 

11 
 
3.3 Sample size and sampling techniques  
The sample size constituted 40 respondents where the researcher employed 
proportionate sampling techniques that involved the use of random sampling in order 
to enable each respondent to have equal chances of being selected in the study. 
3.4 Data collection methods and instruments 
The researcher applied a questionnaire method while collecting data with a self-
administered questionnaire as an instrument because it offers a greater anonymity 
since there no face to face interaction between the respondent and the interviewer 
and this helped the researcher to be in position to collect right and accurate data 
especially on sensitive questions. 
 The researcher used interview method to collect data. The researcher applied an 
interview guide as an instrument to collect information from people involving person 
to person interactions. This enabled the researcher to obtain immediate response 
which eased the researcher study process. 
3.5 Procedures of data collection  
 A pilot study was carried out in Stanbic Bank, Mukono branch to test validity and 
reliability of the data collection instrument. 
3.6 Data collection 
The researcher used both primary and secondary sources of data. 
3.6.1 Primary Data 
 Primary data refers to data observed or collected from first-hand experience, original 
data collected at the source and compiled for the purposes of this study. This was 
collected from self-administered questionnaire. 
 
 

12 
 
3.6.2 Secondary data  
This is data that is extracted from existing literature for example the bank 
publications, journals, text books from the Hamu Mukasa Library. 
3.7 Validity 
 To ensure the validity of the instrument (questionnaire), the research supervisor 
helped as an expert to assess the validity of the research instrument. 
3.8 Data processing and Analysis 
 Data processing and analysis was guided by the objectives of the study and research 
questions. The collected data was arranged and categorized accordingly. The 
researcher edited and coded the data for accuracy and completeness of information 
obtained and responses were summarized using frequencies, percentages and 
presented in tables. Data from interviews was later interpreted and discussed 
alongside with that from the questionnaires. Conclusions and recommendations were 
made in relation to the study on the effect of service quality on customer retention in 
commercial banks. 
3.9 Limitations of the Study.  
The researcher anticipated to meet the following challenges in the course of the 
study  
• Shortage of funds limited the researcher since the study conducted was self-
sponsored.  
•  Time the researcher faced time constraints according to the time given to 
collect and compile data to finish the research while attending classes

CHAPTER FOUR 
RESEARCH FINDINGS AND ANALYSIS 
4.0 Introduction 
The chapter presents and discusses the findings of the study. The findings serve to 
reference the existing knowledge proven about the extent to which service quality 
affected customer retention in commercial banks.  
The chapter involves analysis, interpretation and presentation of the data. Data is 
analyzed, presented and discussed according to the research objectives and questions 
formulated in chapter one. Data was collected and analyzed in the form of tables 
basing on the responses got from respondents. 
4.1 Nature of Respondents 
This section highlights the nature of the respondent’s bio data which includes gender, 
Age, length of the period they stayed in the bank, the data on the respondent’s 
demographics as presented in the subsections below; 
4.1.1 Period spent with Bank 
The study investigated the length of period in years served by the respondents in the 
organization and the findings are presented in the table 4.1.1.

The table 4.1.1 shows that 2.5% of employees of Stanbic bank have stayed in the 
Organization for less than l year, both respondents of 1-2 and 2-4years who have 
stayed in Stanbic Bank have taken 10% and 25% respectively, finally 62.5% have stayed 
for more than 4 years. This implies that the biggest percentage of the respondents 
had worked with the bank for a recognizable period of time thus being knowledgeable 
enough to provide valid responses on the quality of service provided by the bank. 
4.1.2 Age of Respondents 
The study obtained details about the age groups of the respondents for purposes of 
understanding their age and possibly the experience they have in their respective 
positions. Details of the findings are shown in the table 4.1.2 below;

study. The majority of respondents indicated that Stanbic Bank considers customer 
retention to be one of the most important factors, and that element is service 
quality. The conclusions showed that the bank concentrates on upholding its standard 
operating standards in order to keep existing clients and draw in new ones. The 
results showed that the physical facilities were insufficient, causing consumers and 
employees to be congested, which has an impact on how well the company serves its 
clients. Since the majority of respondents indicated that the bank's services are 
available to its clients, this suggests that customer appreciate services offered to 
them thus retention.

but staff still needs additional training on how to interact with and take care of 
consumers.

result, Stanbic Bank should enhance their service quality and put in place more 
effective management systems since higher service quality correlates with greater 
customer retention in the bank.

quality is prioritized based on the findings in chapter four and the inferences made. 
These recommendations are as follows:  
➢ There is a need for more training of employees to improve their knowledge of 
work and service delivery, lessen stress, and motivate them to provide quality 
service to the customers. 
➢ Stressing good communication with clients is important. Customers must be 
treated like kings and with the utmost respect. 
➢ Physical facility expansions are required to make room for delivering consumers 
high-quality services without being backed up.  
➢ In order to be competitive in the face of growing new technologies, commercial 
banks need transition from conventional banking notions to modern banking 
principles. 
5.4 Areas of Further Study  
• The effect of service quality on the competitiveness of commercial banks 
• How customer retention affect the performance of commercial banks.
