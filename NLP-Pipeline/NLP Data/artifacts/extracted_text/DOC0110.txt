ABSTRACT 
Attaining self –satisfaction remains one of the most pressing challenges affecting global citizens. 
Although volunteering may provide one of the pathways to self-satisfaction, opportunities to 
volunteer are profoundly limited. The study explored the impact of volunteering in an agency and 
its impact on self-satisfaction in Bukhalu sub-county, Bulambuli District. Specifically, the study 
explored the different volunteering types that exist and the impact of volunteering in an agency on 
self-satisfaction in Bukhalu sub-county, Bulambuli District. The study also investigated factors 
that hinder volunteering in an agency in Bukhalu sub-county, Bulambuli District. The study used 
qualitative case study design to analyze data from the study area with the help of both qualitative 
and quantitative methods. The researcher collected data from 15 respondents in the study area who 
were selected using simple random and purpose sampling and questionnaires together with 
interview guide were used to collect data. The study discovered that volunteering in schools is one 
form of volunteering available. Others are corporate volunteering, community volunteer work and 
welfare volunteering is a form of volunteering. Findings show that volunteering is relevant for 
people of all ages as a source of social capital and goodwill and this helps to enhance self-
satisfaction it is an important pathway for enhancing youth employment and employability, 
particularly through impacting transferable soft skills that educational institutions often fail to 
address and volunteering is associated with better mental health in older adulthood. Findings 
further revealed that because volunteering could enlarge social network size, its effects would be 
more pronounced for people who have fewer social contacts. Additionally, findings show that 
factors that have been identified as hindering volunteering in formal organizations include a lack 
of time or interest and health problems and people don’t have information about where to 
volunteer, or if they do, the jobs are not meaningful or purposeful as well as absence of 
volunteering programmes for people hinder volunteering in an agency. Other findings show that 
potential volunteers can be discouraged by formal recruitment procedures such as completing a 
long registration form or attending interviews. The study recommended that government and 
stakeholders should put in place initiatives to bolster volunteering culture and government in 
conjunction with local leaders should implement labour-friendly legislation to attract and retain 
volunteers and agencies should provide information to the public regarding opportunities for 
volunteering

CHAPTER ONE 
INTRODUCTION 
1.0 Introduction 
This study sought to determine the impact of religion on cultural stereotypes in Bukhalu sub-
county, Bulambuli District. Religion, broadly defined, is a system of beliefs and practices 
concerning the relationship between humanity and the supernatural, often involving rituals, moral 
codes, and a sense of community. It provides meaning and purpose in life, explaining the origin 
and nature of the universe and human existence (Niels, 2028). Cultural stereotyping is the 
tendency to assign general characteristics, often inaccurate and oversimplified, to an entire group 
of people based on their ethnicity, religion, nationality, or other cultural affiliations. These are 
generalizations that treat all members of a group as identical, ignoring individual differences and 
diversity within the group.. Reeh perceives stereotypes as the product of basic human language 
production. Unfortunately, such linguistic constructions will, through frequent use, be perceived 
not just as connotations, but also as denotations. This process generates the most dangerous result 
of stereotype use: the constitution of in-groups and out-groups in a dialectic and often 
confrontational relationship. It is exactly this construction that may create the aforementioned 
discrimination and hostility. This chapter presents information about the background to the study, 
problem statement, objectives of the study, research questions, scope of the study, and significance 
of the study, limitations and delimitations to the research study. 
1.2 Background to the study 
1.2.1 The phenomenon of volunteering in global perspective 
Volunteering is a global phenomenon with significant impacts on communities and individuals, 
playing a vital role in addressing societal challenges and promoting sustainable 
development. While volunteerism is widespread, its forms and impact can vary across regions and 
demographic groups, with fluctuations observed during events like the COVID-19 pandemic. The 
United Nations Volunteers (UNV) report, "Building Equal and Inclusive Societies," highlights the 
crucial role of volunteerism in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and emphasizes the 
importance of partnerships between volunteers, state authorities, and other stakeholders.  

2 
 
Around the world, societies benefit from the countless number of people who volunteer their time 
to support communities and make a difference. Volunteers are a unique and powerful force in 
development cooperation, especially when they are well prepared and supported, and when they 
contribute to projects that are defined and designed in equitable collaboration with the local 
communities they serve. 
The origin of volunteering can be traced back to 12th century Britain, where there were more than 
500 hospitals operated by volunteers. But it still cannot be excluded that people were selflessly 
helping others even before then. In the beginning, volunteering was strongly connected to religion 
and religious institutions. Using of the word ‘volunteering’, taken from the French language, is 
first traceable to the 17th century, but started being used in the 18th century when people were 
willingly joining the military service. Today, the word is not so much connected with the military 
service, but with community service. The history of organized volunteering as we know it today 
starts with big battles and wars when young people, and especially women would organize to help 
wounded soldiers and to collect supplies. The officially organized volunteering started in the 19th 
century with its peak in the early 20th century, and some of the organizations being active even 
today. 
The International Forum for Volunteering in Development, commonly known as Forum, is the 
most significant global network of Volunteering for Development organisations. Forum exists to 
share information, develop good practice, and enhance cooperation across the volunteering for 
development sector. In 2016, Forum set out to create the first globally agreed standard for 
volunteer involving organisations. Forum’s overarching aim in creating the Global Volunteering 
Standard was to promote and support more impactful, more responsible volunteering. To achieve 
this, the work of volunteer involving organisations must be well-planned, transparent, and 
respectful; and based on genuine partnerships and measurable outcomes. If we can achieve this, 
we will ensure that volunteers make the greatest possible contribution to achieving the Sustainable 
Development Goals and improving the quality of life of all the people who are supported by their 
efforts.  
The Global Standard is the result of a collaborative global effort over three years. This project 
drew on the expertise and wisdom of several hundred people and organisations from 80 countries 
across the volunteering for development sector and beyond. They participated in research, surveys, 

3 
 
workshops and reference groups that drafted the Global Standard. In 2020, 18 organisations around 
the world piloted the Global Standard through the process of Self-Assessment, and their experience 
informed a review that led to the Global Standard that you are reading now. By actively engaging 
a wide range of stakeholders throughout the process of developing, piloting and reviewing the 
Global Standard, Forum has created a resource developed by the volunteering sector, for the 
volunteering sector. We are eternally grateful to everyone who contributed to this work, and to our 
colleagues on the Forum Standards Working Group for their leadership. 
During this time, America experienced the Great Awakening. People became aware of the 
disadvantaged and realized the cause for movement against slavery.[5] In 1851, the first YMCA in 
the United States was started, followed seven years later by the first YWCA. During the American 
Civil War, women volunteered their time to sew supplies for the soldiers and the "Angel of the 
Battlefield" Clara Barton and a team of volunteers began providing aid to servicemen. Barton 
founded the American Red Cross in 1881 and began mobilizing volunteers for disaster relief 
operations, including relief for victims of the Johnstown Flood in 1889. 
Volunteering is an elective and free-choice act of an individual or group freely giving time and 
labor, often for community service.[1][2] Many volunteers are specifically trained in the areas they 
work, such as medicine, education, or emergency rescue. Others serve on an as-needed basis, such 
as in response to a natural disaster. Volunteering, the act of giving one's time and skills to benefit 
others without expecting anything in return, has become increasingly popular on a global scale. It 
has not only captured the attention of individuals but also governments, non-profit organizations, 
and businesses.  
Around the world, more than 860 million people volunteer at least once a month, accounting for 
approximately 15% of the global population. From supplementing emergency services following natural 
disasters, to leading youth development activities, to supporting environmental conservation, volunteers 
play an essential role in addressing social, environmental, and economic challenges in their communities. 
Their engagement yields a substantial impact, contributing an estimated 1.9% to GDP in OECD countries. 
Despite their importance, volunteering rates have been steadily declining in the years leading up to COVID-
19, which further reinforced this trend. Although most recent data suggests that rates have rebounded to 
baseline levels since, several countries are still experiencing historic lows. These underscore the urgent need 
to reinvigorate and volunteering and enhance its contributions to local development.  

4 
 
Today, people are more informed than ever about the challenges faced by different communities, 
whether it be poverty, environmental degradation, education, or healthcare access. This heightened 
awareness drives individuals to seek opportunities abroad, recognizing that their skills, time, and 
resources can make a difference in communities across borders. Additionally, the globalization of 
social networks and the ease of digital communication have played a crucial role in promoting 
volunteering on a global scale. Social media platforms provide a platform for individuals to share 
their experiences, inspire others, and connect with like-minded individuals around the 
world. Governments and non-profit organizations have also recognized the power of volunteering 
as a catalyst for positive change and social development. Many countries have established 
initiatives, such as volunteer programs or grants, to encourage citizens to engage in volunteer work 
As part of the next State of the World’s Volunteerism Report, UNV commissioned a study based 
on original multi-country quantitative data to understand patterns of volunteer participation during 
the global COVID-19 pandemic, volunteer motivations and experiences, and what these might 
mean for people’s voluntary participation in the remainder of the Decade of Action. For this study, 
nationally representative surveys with more than 8,000 people were conducted in eight countries 
- Bolivia, India, Kenya, Lebanon, Senegal, Thailand, Turkey and Uzbekistan – between March 
and April 2021. 
However, volunteering levels were clearly affected by the pandemic, for example by lockdowns, 
individual circumstances, and different volunteering opportunities. In some countries, 
volunteering declined while in others it increased during the pandemic. There is no clear pattern 
across different countries and groups, although unemployed people were likely to volunteer less 
than in previous year, possibly because they struggled to meet their own basic needs. 
The situation of Volunteering in African 
Volunteering in African countries is a significant and growing phenomenon, with a large number 
of individuals engaging in both formal and informal volunteer activities. The continent is 
experiencing a re-emergence of volunteerism as a tool for addressing development, peace, and 
security challenges. While it's estimated that Africa has 12.1 million full-time equivalent 
volunteers, the actual number is likely higher due to the prevalence of informal volunteering 

5 
 
Africa has the youngest population in the world, with 70 per cent of Sub-Saharan Africa under the 
age of 30, according to UN estimates. By 2050, one out of three young people in the world will be 
living in Sub-Saharan Africa. The burgeoning youth population is both an opportunity and a 
challenge for the continent. To harness this demographic opportunity, there are hurdles for the 
continent to overcome. One of the most significant hurdles is that of youth unemployment. While 
the continent's significant natural resources are vital, the creativity, skills and innovation of its 
youthful population will be the most important factor in the continent's economic transformation. 
The African Development Bank reports that while 10 million to 12 million youth enter the 
workforce in Africa each year, only 3 million formal jobs are created annually. Consequently, one-
third of African youth are unemployed, another third are vulnerably employed, and only one in six 
are in wage employment, with informal employment accounting for more than 80 per cent of total 
employment in the region. Most youth therefore lack access to social safety nets and sustainable 
livelihoods. The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the situation further. The 
situation is also complex for young girls who often face a multitude of related challenges including 
limited access to reproductive health services and education. 
The frustration and hopelessness of an unemployed young African population can have severe 
consequences not only for the region, but across the world. Youth unemployment in Africa 
translates to poorer living conditions, fuels migration out of Africa, and contributes to conflicts 
and destabilization in the region. The good news is that Africa’s youth unemployment challenge 
is already being addressed by key African institutions and by African governments with great 
imagination, scale, and ambition. At the continental level, youth unemployment is at the heart 
of African Union’s Agenda 2063 that aims to realize an ‘integrated, prosperous and peaceful 
Africa, driven by its own citizens, representing a dynamic force in the international arena’. 
In line with this continental vision, several African governments have put in place ambitious 
strategies to address the challenge. But African governments cannot act alone. Development 
partners, private foundations, and foreign institutions resident in Africa have a responsibility to 
provide support. The severity of the challenge varies between the different sub-regions, between 
countries and within individual countries over time. We can therefore not have one-size-fits-all 
solutions. However, some challenges remain common across most of sub-Saharan Africa and 
lessons from different countries could be useful in others.

Volunteering in Uganda  
Volunteering in Uganda is a growing field with significant opportunities for impactful work, 
particularly in areas like education, health, and community development. Many organizations, 
including Go Volunteer Africa, Love Volunteers, and VSO, offer various programs centered in 
Kampala and other parts of Uganda. Volunteers can assist in orphanages, clinics, schools, and 
community development projects, contributing to education, healthcare, and social welfare.  
In Uganda there are opportunities in a variety of fields, each of which is certain to make a decisive 
difference to people’s lives in a country which has been blighted by problems for decades and 
where half of the population are under 18, many of them living on the streets. Volunteer projects 
in Uganda are centred in Kampala and include work in orphanages, clinics and hospitals, as well 
as primary and secondary schools. Volunteering overseas - particularly in a challenging 
environment - is an experience you will look back on with pride. It will bring a greater 
understanding of, and compassion for, humanity. With volunteers in Uganda coming from many 
walks of life and generations, it is often a way of forging new and lasting friendships. Volunteering 
in Uganda gives you the chance to live amongst a population urgently requiring help. 
Uganda is toward the east of Africa and borders the Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan, 
Tanzania, Kenya and Rwanda. The bulk of the country comprises a plateau, which is 4,000 feet 
above sea level. Lake Victoria occupies a large part of the south of the country. While 
predominantly Christian, Uganda has many cultures living within its borders, and several African 
languages are spoken. The programs that Love Volunteers is involved with have few resources 
and would find it difficult to operate without the valuable input and assistance from our volunteers 
in Uganda 
For many of Uganda’s young graduates, the transition from school to work is encumbered by 
various obstacles. One of these obstacles is the lack of hands-on skills required by the labour 
market which Universities and other educational institutions are not able to provide. To address 
this obstacle and enhance the young graduates’ employability, the United Nations Development 
Programme (UNDP) and United Nations Volunteers (UNV) have partnered with the Government 
of Uganda through the Ministry of Gender, Labour and Social Development (MoGLSD) on the 

7 
 
Uganda Graduate Volunteer Scheme (UGVS) – a project that is intended to provide a bridge for 
young Ugandan graduates as they transit from school to work. 
1.3 Problem statement 
Preliminary findings indicates that self-satisfaction, or the feeling of being content with oneself 
and one's life, offers numerous benefits, including improved mental and physical health, enhanced 
relationships, and greater overall well-being. It also fosters resilience to challenges and setbacks, 
increased motivation, and a greater sense of purpose and happiness. It also lead to Improved 
Mental and Physical Health, Reduced stress and anxiety, Stronger immune performance and 
Better cardiovascular functioning. Preliminary findings further reveal that less vulnerability to 
chronic stress, longer life, Improved mood and enhanced relationships (Mwiti et a al., 
2019). However, in Bukhalu sub-county show preliminary findings that there is lack of self-
satisfaction, particularly low self-esteem, can lead to various negative consequences, 
including mental health issues like depression and anxiety, as well as challenges in relationships 
and overall well-being. It can also impact decision-making, potentially leading to unhealthy 
behaviors or unhealthy relationship patterns (in Bukhalu sub-county situational analysis report, 
2024).  
Preliminary results further show that lack of self-satisfaction, relationships, or health. Low self-
esteem and a lack of confidence may have associations with mental health conditions such as 
anxiety and depression and it may be due to lack of volunteerism (Ojangole et al., 2023). Despite 
of interventions by government and development partners in improve self-satisfactions among the 
people through putting in place volunteerism programs, this intervention is not yielding targeted 
results and if the situation is not addressed, depression and anxiety, suicidal thoughts and 
Addiction  Even so-called positive stereotypes can be harmful. Preliminary results also reveal that 
there is there is no single comprehensive author survey regarding the impact of volunteering in an 
agency and its impact on self-satisfaction in Bukhalu sub-county, Bulambuli District and this has 
resulted into limitations and distortions in literature, a gap this study sought to address

Figure 1.1: Conceptual framework 
Source: Adapted from Mugenda and Muganda (2004):  Conceptual Frameworks 
The above conceptual framework shows the relationship between variables. Volunteering with 
parameters of volunteering in schools, corporate volunteering, community volunteer work and 
welfare volunteering. While dependent variable is Self-satisfaction measured in terms of Feeling 
good, Peace and stability, Accomplishment and Enjoying fruits of labor. The conceptual 
framework has been drawn on the assumption that if people are allowed to volunteer,, there will 
be increased levels of self-satisfaction and the reverse is undoubtedly true. Nevertheless, this may 
not be automatic as other factors may come into play. These may include community sensitization, 
government policies and labor laws reforms. These factors have been dully coined as intervening 
variables by the study and are being isolated to avoid making wrong conclusions.

1.11 Definition of key terms 
Volunteering: Is the act of willingly offering one's time, energy, and skills for the 
benefit of others or a cause, without expecting financial compensation. It's a way to give 
back to the community, make a positive impact, and gain valuable skills and experience 
(Glays et al., 2020) 
Self-satisfaction: The quality of being very pleased with yourself and accepting no criticism of 
yourself (ILO, 2019) 
1.12 Chapter summary 
The above chapter discussed the introductory part of this research and it has been observed that 
volunteer work experience was valued equally as paid work by hiring managers when evaluating 
candidates. Volunteering also illustrates to potential employers that an individual has demonstrated 
a willingness to work and is committed to their own professional development. A caveat is that 
not all volunteer opportunities will have an equal effect on increasing employability and a critical 
lens should be used in assessing volunteering options. 
1.13 Conclusion  
The introduction section has discussed the background to the study, problem statement, objectives 
and study scope well as significance of the findings and conceptual frame work. This section 
outlined the gaps and presented the rationale for the study. This led to the statement of the problem. 
The researcher identified existing studies to support the problem under investigation. The next 
chapter will discuss an array of past studies that are significantly related to the area under 
investigation. During the review, the research study will consider conceptual, contextual, theatrical 
and methodological genius of authors and endeavored to point out gaps in these studies that this 
study addressed

CHAPTER TWO 
LITERATURE REVIEW 
2.0 Introduction 
The study contained information about the impact of volunteering in an agency and its impact on 
self-satisfaction in Bukhalu sub-county, Bulambuli District. Specifically, the study explored the 
different volunteering types that exist and the impact of volunteering in an agency on self-
satisfaction in Bukhalu sub-county, Bulambuli District. The study also investigated factors that 
hinder volunteering in an agency in Bukhalu sub-county, Bulambuli District. According to 
Mugenda and Mugenda (2017) and Kumar (2019) interprets literature review as the systematic 
identification, location and analysis of documents containing information related to the research 
problem being investigated, which forms an integral part of the entire research process and makes 
a valuable contribution to almost every operational step in the research. This chapter shows the 
various sources literature related to the topic of the research. The sources include; review of 
scholarly journals, government documents, text books, Internet and Newspapers. This Literature 
review is done objective by objective. This chapter therefore shows and explains the review of 
past and actual literature studies which has been reviewed objective by objective. It included 
theoretical review, empirical literature review and summary of identified gaps. 
2.1 Types of Volunteering that Exist 
Volunteering in schools 
Adams (2019) found that resource poor schools around the world rely on government support 
or on efforts from volunteers and private donations, in order to run effectively. In some countries, 
whenever the economy is down, the need for volunteers and resources increases greatly. School 
systems offer many volunteer opportunities with minimal requirements. Whether one is a high 
school or TEFL (Teaching English as a Foreign Language) graduate or college student, most 
schools require just voluntary and selfless effort.  
Allen (2018) argued that much like the benefits of any type of volunteering there are great 
rewards for the volunteer, student, and school. In addition to intangible rewards, volunteers can 
add relevant experience to their resumes. Volunteers who travel to assist may learn foreign culture 

13 
 
and language. "Volunteering can give the students the sufficient experience in order to support and 
strengthen their CVs and resumes." Volunteering in schools can be an additional teaching guide 
for the students and help to fill the gap of local teachers. Cultural and language exchange during 
teaching and other school activities can be the most essential learning experience for both students 
and volunteers (Allen, 2018). 
Corporate volunteering 
Benefacto, a volunteering brokerage, describe corporate volunteering as "Companies giving their 
employees an allowance of paid time off annually, which they use to volunteer at a charity of their 
choice." A majority of the companies at the Fortune 500 allow their employees to volunteer during 
work hours (Babchuk & Booth, 2018). These formalized Employee Volunteering Programs 
(EVPs), also called Employer Supported Volunteering (ESV) are regarded as a part of the 
companies' sustainability efforts and their social responsibility activities. About 40% of Fortune 
500 companies provide monetary donations, also known as volunteer grants, to nonprofits as a 
way to recognize employees who dedicate significant amounts of time to volunteering in the 
community (Bowman, 2019).  
Relatedly, Bowman (2019) found that According to the information from Volunteer Match, a 
service that provides Employee Volunteering Program solutions, the key drivers for companies 
that produce and manage EVPs are building brand awareness and affinity, strengthening trust and 
loyalty among consumers, enhancing corporate image and reputation, improving employee 
retention, increasing employee productivity and loyalty, and providing an effective vehicle to 
reach strategic goals.  
Community volunteer work 
Community volunteering, in the US called "community service", refers globally to those who work 
to improve their local community. This activity commonly occurs through not for profit 
organizations, local governments and churches; but also encompasses ad-hoc or informal groups 
such as recreational sports teams (Bowman, 2019). 
 

14 
 
Welfare volunteering 
Adams (2019) opined that in some European countries government organisations and non-
government organisations provide auxiliary positions for a certain period in institutions like 
hospitals, schools, memorial sites and welfare institutions. The difference to other types of 
volunteering is that there are strict legal regulations, what organisation is allowed to engage 
volunteers and about the period a volunteer is allowed to work in a voluntary position. Due to that 
fact, the volunteer is getting a limited amount as a pocket money from the government. 
Organizations having the biggest manpower in Europe are the Voluntary social year  with more 
than 50.000 volunteers per year, and the Federal volunteers service with about 30.000 to 40.000 
volunteers per year (Bowman, 2019). 
Volunteering at major sporting events 
Babchuk & Booth (2018) argued that 1,000 volunteers worked at the 2014 Sochi Winter 
Olympics. They supported the organisers in more than 20 functional areas: meeting guests, 
assisting navigation, organising the opening and closing ceremonies, organising food outlets, etc. 
Volunteer applications were open to any nationals of Russia and other countries. The Sochi 2014 
Organising Committee received about 200,000 applications, 8 applicants per place. Volunteers 
received training over the course of more than a year at 26 volunteer centres in 17 cities across 
Russia. The majority of participants were between 17 and 22 years old. At the same time, 3000 
applications were submitted from people over 55 years old. Some of them worked as volunteers 
during the 1980 Olympics in Moscow. It was the first experience with such a large-scale volunteer 
program in the contemporary Russia (Bowman, 2019) 
Medical Volunteering 
A study by Allen (2018) found that volunteering in the context of delivering medical care is 
referred to as medical volunteering. In general, medical volunteering has been lauded as a "ethical 
responsibility to aid the needy. The activities are often offered by both for profit and not for profit 
associations. Medical volunteers typically participate in unpaid medical volunteer programs in 
hospitals, clinics, and underserved areas. Typically, these regions are in underdeveloped nations 
or nations battling natural disasters, sickness, or violence (Babchuk & Booth, 2018).). These 

15 
 
activities typically involve volunteer physicians and nurses. Dental volunteering is a part of 
medical volunteering which predominantly focused on dental care. 
2.2 The impact of volunteering in an agency on self-satisfaction 
Volunteerism is relevant for people of all ages as a source of social capital and goodwill and this 
helps to enhance elf-satisfaction. In the context of most African countries, volunteerism is 
particularly an important tool for promoting youth development. Research ILO (2020) shows that 
volunteerism is an important pathway for enhancing youth employment and employability, 
particularly through impacting transferable soft skills that educational institutions often fail to 
address. By volunteering, young professionals can sharpen their professional value propositions 
and problem-solving skills. 
Kronauer (2021) recognizes two aspects of social integration i.e., interdependence and 
participation. The first refers to the integration into the process of the labour division and social 
networks; while the second refers to the material, cultural or political participation as well as other 
forms of social engagement (e.g. volunteering). Being a volunteer (i.e., the involvement in unpaid 
activity to benefit other people) could play a key role in individual social integration, since it may 
be an additional source of social recognition (Omara ET AL., 2017). This especially for individuals 
with a chronic disability, who have to face numerous barriers when trying to enter the labour 
market and are often excluded. Active volunteering can offset the negative impact of other life 
conditions such as having long-term health problems or being unemployed 
Current economic literature on volunteering analyses the choices of people to participate in unpaid 
activities in the framework of a consumption model of an intangible good or an investment model 
in human capital (ILO, 2018). Both models are ascribed to the orthodox economic tradition 
according to which the agent is a ‘homo economicus’ driven in his choices only by a self-interest. 
The consumption model presents the individual choice to dedicate oneself to volunteering as the 
intention to use his/her free time in the consumption of ‘activities’ (goods) that increase his/her 
immediate well-being (intrinsic satisfaction). This choice is motivated by the search for private 
goods such as prestige, reputation or a feeling of warm-glow produced by the act of giving 
(Andreoni, 2020). Stebbins (2017) reports various rewards from taking part in volunteer work, 
such as personal enrichment (by helping others), self-actualisation (developing skills and 

16 
 
knowledge), self-expression, self-image and self-gratification. The sense of satisfaction partly 
results from these rewards (Stebbins, 2018). Andreoni (2017) has formally added the idea that 
giving produces a pleasant sensation, called ‘warm-glow’. This is formulated as the donor's 
preference for giving in itself, distinct from the benefit enjoyed by the recipient.  
In addition, empirical literature shows a positive effect of volunteer work on health outcomes, such 
as: self-rated health; improvement of physical and mental health; less likely to suffer from 
depression (Okiria et al., 2021) Guidi et al. (2020) show the positive correlation between 
volunteering and the enjoying of material and immaterial well-being in Italy. In the case of those 
with a chronic disability, current literature mainly focuses on the effects of volunteering as a 
passive measure rather than as an unpaid work performed actively by these individuals to benefit 
others. 
 
Volunteering is associated with better mental health in older adulthood (Baker et al., 2017). 
Helping behaviours generate better well‐being across culturally (Aknin et al., 2020). Previous 
studies have consistently found that volunteering benefits life satisfaction, mental health, and well‐
being in older adults. Socio-emotional selectivity theory has been used to explain this relationship. 
(Carstensen et al., 20219) proposes that people prioritise different goals throughout their lives. In 
particular, people shift their focus from knowledge goals (e.g., learning a new skill) to emotional 
goals (e.g., experiencing positive and meaningful emotions), as they view their future time horizon 
as increasingly shortened, such as in older adulthood. Initially, staying with close social partners 
(such as family members) and enjoying positive emotions were considered as “emotional goals” 
that older adults pursue. Scheibe and Carstensen (2018) further clarified that the emotional goals 
prioritised by older adults are goals that are emotionally meaningful. In other words, an emotional 
goal may be negative in some situations (Fung et al., 2016), and older adults may choose to stay 
with strangers if they find that such activity can facilitate the achievement of emotional goals.  
Because volunteering contributes to the needs and welfare of others, making it consistent with 
older adults' emotional goals (Thoits, 2018), emotional goals are achieved when older adults help 
others. Life satisfaction therefore increases after volunteering. In addition, volunteering is 
consistent with the stage emphasising “generativity” in Erikson's psychosocial theory (1950). 
Generativity refers to the willingness to take care of children and others. Volunteering is an activity 

17 
 
during which individuals offer care and supports to others. Therefore, volunteering may be 
particularly important for older adults to achieve the goal of generativity. 
Morrow‐Howell et al., (2017) argued that because volunteering could enlarge social network size, 
its effects would be more pronounced for people who have fewer social contacts than those who 
have a large social network. People who have more social contacts might obtain sufficient 
resources from their existing social connections, and thus, the effects of volunteering would be 
less pronounced (Bowman, 2019). Volunteering is an approachable activity that people can easily 
participate in; thus, volunteering can be an efficient way to achieve emotional goals. In addition, 
people with smaller social networks may have fewer social roles; therefore, the role of a volunteer 
may be more important to these individuals than to those who have larger social networks and 
more social roles (Adams, 2019). Therefore, the positive effects of volunteering may be more 
salient in people who have smaller social networks. 
Furthermore, Oman, Thoresen, and McMahon (2018) found that volunteering was more protective 
in people who perceived a greater level of social support. Other studies found that older adults who 
had more frequent contacts with friends and those who had close intimate relationships (Oman et 
al.,2020) had greater reductions in mortality risk after volunteering. In a younger adult sample, 
volunteering was associated with fewer problem behaviours in a larger magnitude in the 
adolescents who received more support and instructions on coping with life challenges (Philliber, 
Herrling, & Kuperminc, 2020) than those who had less support and instructions. Oman and 
Thoresen (2017) argued that older people could achieve the mutual goals of remaining active and 
generative by connecting with social partners. These goals were important for strengthening the 
positive effects of volunteering. Thus, people with more social connections or social support 
benefitted more. 
2.3 Factors hindering volunteering 
Bowman (2019) argued with regard to personality factors linked to volunteering, Binder and 
Freytag (2020) found a significant relationship between being open and extroverted and a greater 
predisposition towards doing volunteer work. In this case, 5000 British households were studied 
through 15,000 individual interviews, the sample consisting of people aged over 16.  

18 
 
Factors that have been identified as hindering volunteering in formal organizations include a lack 
of time or interest and health problems (Oktagi et al., 2021). Psychological distance, understood 
as the perception that formal organizations are overly bureaucratic and complicated, has also been 
found to be a hindering factor regardless of age. A bibliographical review carried out by Dávila de 
León and Díaz–Morales (2019) highlighted the following as factors that favor volunteering work 
among the older adults: a good economic level, a high level of education, good health, the belief 
that they will improve and expand their social relations, and the perception of receiving social 
support when performing this type of work. 
There are also a number of obstacles to older adults doing volunteer work. In the study conducted 
on a sample of 735 people aged over 65 by Medina–Tornero and Carbonell–Cutillas (2018) 71.5% 
of the volunteers surveyed and 73.8% of the non-volunteers expressed agreement with the 
statement “Older adults have time to volunteer, but there are almost no programmes or actions for 
them to participate in” (2019). The study presented here explored the factors that facilitate and 
hinder social-health volunteering from the perspective of the older adults themselves. A mixed 
methodology has been used, which to the best of our knowledge has not been done in other 
investigations. 
 
Morrow‐Howell et al., (2017) found that that volunteering is not an irrational act, and inquiry into 
the philosophical, sociological, and psychological bases for decisions to undertake such work is 
needed (Musick and Wilson, 2017). Work commitments are the most frequently cited reason for 
not volunteering in England (The National Archives, 2020). Other reasons include childcare 
commitments and looking after the home, doing other things, not knowing about volunteering 
opportunities, study commitments, looking after an elderly relative, disability, and age. Volunteer 
prevalence is not just an individual choice to volunteer or not but is also affected by what other 
people are thinking and doing  
Adams (2019) argued that potential volunteers can be discouraged by formal recruitment 
procedures such as completing a long registration form or attending an interview. These can be 
daunting for people with learning needs or English as a second language. HVC can assist 
volunteers with this to try and speed up the recruitment process. This can be discussed and tailor 

19 
 
made for each organisational need. If you want HVC to assist in this please contact for more 
details. Organisations sometimes forget to develop different recruitment procedures for volunteers 
and staff. If you do use registration forms, only request information which is necessary. For 
example, you might simply need to know that someone meets a minimum age limit for insurance 
purposes, rather than asking their exact date of birth. You might even decide not to use registration 
forms and note down the important details during an introductory chat with a new volunteer 
(Adams, 2019) 
Philliber, Herrling, & Kuperminc, (2020) found that there are lots of different barriers that people 
might face when looking for volunteering opportunities. The potential volunteer may have issues 
with transport (like unreliable bus services and other means of transport being very expensive). 
Some people are sensitive to certain temperatures and might feel unable to come to their voluntary 
work if it’s too hot or cold. Some need to take more time off than others so that they can keep 
appointments that are important for their well-being. People with certain disabilities may struggle 
in particular environments (but still want to work in that setting). People from different cultures 
might need to take time off for religious events (and might not feel comfortable to wear certain 
clothes if there’s a uniform involved) (Adams, 2019) 
  
In their other works, Philliber, Herrling, & Kuperminc, (2021) Some people may need to take 
breaks at certain times so that they can take medication that’s important for their well-being and 
some people may need a quiet space to relax for a bit (people who have Autism and experience 
sensory overload might need somewhere where they can chill out for a bit and “stim”). Some 
people who have Tourette’s may have tic attacks where they need to be on their own for a bit (these 
can be exhausting). People who have epilepsy may need someone to stay with them after a seizure 
and if able to be moved once they have come out of it, then it might be good to have a quiet place 
for them to relax. People who have mental health issues may need somewhere to chill if things get 
too much for them and they need a break.   
  
People who have physical disabilities or health conditions may need adjustments made so that they 
can work comfortably (with things at their level if they need to sit down) or easy to reach if they 
have to reach up and are able to do so. Some people (no matter what their disability or background) 

20 
 
may want or need someone to support them until they feel comfortable in their voluntary role (like 
a mentor).   
Bowman (2019) found that nother very common reason is that people don’t have information about 
where to volunteer, or if they do, the jobs are not meaningful or purposeful. While motivation to 
volunteer can vary by age, with younger volunteers more motivated by future preparation (such as 
increasing skills, knowledge, and advancing careers) and older volunteers more likely to cite 
generativity as a reason for volunteering, most people are motivated to volunteer by personal 
gratification and having a meaningful experience. A solution would be for organizations who 
utilize volunteers to make sure they are matching the skills and experience of their volunteers to 
the roles they have available. Making copies and coffee are certainly not meaningful to most. Some 
organizations have a short interview process where they discuss the background of the potential 
volunteer to closely match it to the needs they have. 
2.4 Research gaps  
Past studies on volunteering have faced challenges like a lack of focus on specific groups, 
inconsistent measurement of volunteer performance, and a focus on organizational benefits rather 
than individual experiences. Additionally, some research has struggled to adequately address the 
complexities of volunteer motivations and the impact of different types of volunteer opportunities.  
Elaboration: 
Much of the research on volunteering has been broad, failing to delve deeply into specific 
demographics, types of volunteer activities, or the nuances of volunteer experiences. For 
example, studies may not adequately address the unique challenges faced by community health 
volunteers in diverse settings, or the impact of volunteering on individuals with specific needs 
or backgrounds.  
 
Performance Measurement Issues: 
Many studies have struggled to develop reliable and valid measures of volunteer 
performance. While some studies have focused on indicators like volunteer satisfaction, 

21 
 
retention, or productivity, others have lacked comprehensive assessment tools that capture the 
full range of volunteer contributions and the impact on service organizations.  
 
Limited Focus on Individual Experiences: 
While some research has explored the benefits of volunteering for individuals, it often focuses 
on the broader societal or organizational impact, potentially overlooking the unique perspectives 
and experiences of volunteers themselves. This can lead to a lack of understanding about the 
challenges volunteers face, the factors that influence their motivation, and the impact of 
volunteering on their well-being.  
 
Incomplete Understanding of Volunteer Motivation: 
Studies have often relied on simplistic models of volunteer motivation, failing to capture the 
complex interplay of factors that drive individuals to volunteer. For example, research may not 
adequately address the influence of social norms, personal values, or the impact of previous 
experiences on volunteer behavior. This study will therefore impact of volunteering in an agency 
and its impact on self-satisfaction in Bukhalu sub-county, Bulambuli District

CHAPTER THREE 
RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 
3.1 Introduction 
The study explored the impact of volunteering in an agency and its impact on self-satisfaction in 
Bukhalu sub-county, Bulambuli District. Specifically, the study explored the different 
volunteering types that exist and the impact of volunteering in an agency on self-satisfaction in 
Bukhalu sub-county, Bulambuli District. The study also investigated factors that hinder 
volunteering in an agency in Bukhalu sub-county, Bulambuli District. In order to achieve the 
desired outcomes of a non-biased study report, this chapter presents the methods that the researcher 
employed while conducting the study.  It show the research design, study population, sample size 
and selection, sampling techniques and procedures, data collection methods and techniques, 
validity and reliability of instruments, procedure of data collection, data analysis, variable 
definition and measurement and ethical considerations.  
3.2 Research Design 
A case study is a qualitative research design best suited for gaining an in-depth understanding of 
a social phenomenon within its cultural context without imposing pre-existing expectations 
(Denzin & Lincoln, 2012). Gall et al. (2017) agree with this definition as they define a case study 
as an indepth study of instances of a phenomenon in its natural context and from the perspectives 
of the participants involved in the phenomenon and in educational research. Best and Kahn (2006) 
also define a case study as a way of organizing social data for the purpose of viewing social reality. 
It examines a social unit as a whole. The social unit may be a person, a family, a social group or a 
community (Best & Kahn, 2016). Gall et al. (2017) propound that in a case study, a significant 
amount of data are collected about the specific case selected to represent the phenomenon. The 
justification for the choice of a case study is that it was restrict the researcher to a small, 
manageable group, where rigorous and thorough explorations were made to examine the 
phenomenon of raising children on urban streets (Best & Kahn, 2016). The case study also 
provided in-depth, comprehensive and vivid data in this study, as well as a thick description 
thereof. It also enabled the researcher to gain an in-depth understanding of the impact of 
volunteering in an agency and its impact on self-satisfaction 

23 
 
1.3 Area of study  
The study was carried out in Bukhalu sub-county, Bulambuli district  
3.4 Sources of information 
3.4.1 Primary data 
This involved collecting data directly from each ward using probability sampling method from 
local people, local leaders and division staffs. New information in this case will be collected. 
3.4.2 Secondary sources 
These are sources which are already gathered, processed and stored for the purpose. These sources 
provided more knowledge to the researcher under the area of investigation. They include 
information from text books, records and respondents, information. 
3.5 Population and sampling techniques 
The population of study means all items of inquiry which constitute a universe or population which 
describes the sample size that was used to collect data to support the study (Kothari 2005). The 
population of study comprised of 10 local leaders, 10 local people and 10 NGO staffs venders. 
Local people are chosen to participate in this study because they understand the impact of 
volunteering in an agency and its impact on self-satisfaction while local leaders are selected 
because their effort at formulating and implementation of labor policies. Additionally, NGO staffs 
were chosen because they have relevant information regarding their involvement in addressing 
unemployment. The study population was drawn from Bukhalu sub-county, Bulambuli district  
The total number of study participants (N) was 25 people and therefore the sample of 15  
participated in the study, that is to say; 05 local leaders, 05 local people and 05 NGO staffs using 
Krejcie and Morgan (1970) methods of determining sample size from the population (Sarmah & 
Hazanka, 2012).

Sampling Technique 
3.7.1 Purposive sampling 
The researcher used purposive sampling to select 5 local leaders, 5 local people and 5 NGO staffs. 
These study participants was selected because they possess the required information. Purposive 
sampling enabled the researcher to get in-depth information that helped to answer the research 
questions. 
3.8 Procedure for data collection 
The researcher got a letter from the department of social sciences which was presented to 
authorities in Bukhalu sub-county, Bulambuli district  to allow for data collection. Thereafter, the 
researcher sent consent letters to the responders requesting for them to participate in the study. 
Raw data was then be compared and coded before data analysis is done. During editing, points of 
views of the participants that seemed unclear were clarified so as to make certain of the meaning 
of the seemingly ambiguous replies. Thereafter, the researcher wrote a report that was submitted 
to the department for examination. 
3.9 Data Collection Instruments 
The researcher used interview and observation methods for data collection.   

25 
 
3.9.1 Interview 
Data collection method is the process of assembling and measuring information on targeted 
variables in an established systematic style which enables one to answer research questions and 
evaluate outcomes (Lescroëlet al. 2017). This study collected primary information through 
conducting structured interviews. According to Amin (2005), an interview is a structured and 
unstructured set of questions administered to interviewee(s). It is an oral administration of a 
questionnaire and therefore it was a face-to-face encounter. The researcher used interview schedule 
to collect data from participants. Interview method was used because it helped to provide in-depth 
data which is not possible to get using a questionnaire.  
1.9.2 Documentary Review 
The researcher undertook Documentary reviews in research serve to analyze and interpret existing 
documents to gain insights, understand a phenomenon, or develop a narrative. This process 
involves examining various types of documents, such as historical records, official reports, or 
personal accounts, to uncover patterns, themes, and contextual information. Documentary research 
is particularly valuable for social scientists, educators, and historian (Gall et al., 2007). Documents 
can provide valuable insights into past events, social movements, and cultural trends, helping 
researchers understand the present in relation to the pas (Best & Kahn, 2006:264). Purpose of 
documentary research is to gather verifiable evidence, that can help researchers understand clearly 
events that occurred in the past/present and also uncover new knowledge by analyzing existing 
documents and materials (Thorndike & Hagen, 2000). In this study, the researcher review 
documents such as arrival books, recruitment minutes,, voluntary staff lists and application 
forms/letters 
3.10 Quality control 
3.10.1 Validity 
The validity of an instrument is defined as the ability of an instrument to measure what it is 
intended to measure. Validity considers how correctly the research tools measure what the 
researcher wants to measure. Thus, validity is about the research tool being credible or trustworthy 
or being accurate or correct (Etyang, 2018).After formulating the questionnaire, the supervisors 
and other experts reviewed the items and checked the language clarity, content 

26 
 
comprehensiveness, and relevancy and how long the questionnaire is. To establish the validity of 
the instruments, the researcher used expert judgement as recommended by Gay (1997) as the best 
method for ensuring validity. Thus the researcher ensured that the instrument is clear, relevant, 
specific and logically arranged. The validity of the interview guide was tested using the content 
validity test (CVI). To arrive at the relevancy of the questionnaire, the researcher designed the 
instrument that yielded content –valid data by first specifying the domain of indictors that are 
relevant to the concept being measured. A content-valid data measure contained all possible items 
that measure the impact of volunteering in an agency and its impact on self-satisfaction 
3.10.2 Reliability 
A tool’s reliability shows the extent to which it is free of errors and for that makes sure that there 
is continuous valuation across time and also across the various items in the instrument. This 
therefore means that a tool’s reliability shows how stably and consistently the tool evaluates the 
idea thereby helping to measure the worthiness of a measure (Sekaran & Bougie, 2019). The 
researcher employed the test-retest reliability. According to Sekaran and Bougie(2019), the 
reliability of the instrument is tested using the test re-test method of reliability and Cron-bach alpha 
tests to determine the reliability index with the help of SPSS. Data was collected from 10 people 
not among those in the sample. The principle of reliability as far as research instruments are 
concerned, is clearly put forward by Amin (2019), an instrument is reliable if it produces the same 
results wherever it is repeatedly used to measure a trait or a concept from the same population and 
under similar circumstances.  
3.11 Data Processing and Analysis 
Data analysis is the process of methodically applying logical techniques to describe and illustrate, 
summarize and recap, and evaluate data (Shamoo & Resnik, 2003). The task is to make sense of 
massive amounts of data, reduce the volume of information, identify significant patterns and 
construct an outline communicating the essence of what the data reveal (Best & Kahn, 2006).  
3.14 Ethical considerations  
The following ethical considerations were looked at by the researcher during the research.  

27 
 
3.14.1 Informed consent and voluntary participation: The researcher sought consent from the 
respondents to involve in the research not just forcing them to participate. Informed consent is the 
basis of ethical research (Denzin & Lincoln, 2019). The people participating in the study were 
made aware of what the study is about, it’s purpose, usage of the data, and any consequences that 
could arise from it (Fleming, 2018). The researcher furnished the respondents with information on 
the reason for the research and the procedure of collecting data. The participants were allowed 
enough time to ask questions and have any concerns addressed.  The respondents exercised free 
will in deciding whether to participate in research activity or not. All people to be involved in the 
research was given consent form to express their acceptance to participate in the study. 
3.14.2 Confidentiality: Confidentiality is looked at by Walford(2018) to mean information that is 
private andis not to be divulged to others. Whatever has been said in confidence must remain 
confidential. The researcher assured participants that information offered by the respondent was 
not to be passed on to another party (third party) without consent of the respondent. Their identity 
and response were made confidential and anonymized through the use of numbers or through 
pseudonyms. 
3.14.3 Anonymity: Anonymity, termed more appropriately as pseudonymity, is defined by Wiles 
(2013) as a major meansused by the researcher to safeguard the confidentiality of responders by 
using pseudonyms.Anonymisation is one of the kinds of confidentiality, comprising of identity 
concealment of research responders (Saunders, Kitzinger, & Kitzinger, 2015). The researcher 
ensured that all respondents are anonymous implying that their identities are not known and not 
salient in the study. Withholding the identity of respondents is a guarantees that their statements 
are authentic (Taylor, 2015). 
3.14.4 Plagiarism: The researcher ensured that all written work was original and without any 
borrowed and manipulated texts, results or even expressions. The researcher made sure that, all 
words and publications of the author are given their due acknowledgement (Mugenda & Mugenda, 
2019).  The researcher subjected the written works to the turn it in software and make sure it is 
15% or less compliant of plagiarism material.

3.12 
Methodological constraints 
The study may be affected by non-response rate. This may be due to the fact that some respondents 
may be hesitant to give information. However, this was solved through having a dialogue with 
respondents and explaining clearly the purpose of the study. 
The problem of limited time, many respondents had no enough time to respond adequately to the 
questions while attending to their busy schedules. 
In adequate finances, the researcher had little funds to move to and fro the field and more so buying 
the necessary requirements used in the study. However, friends and relatives were requested to 
contribute to solve the situation. 
2.5 Conclusion  
This chapter has presented the research methodology that ere employed. Qualitative research 
design to present data that was collected from 15 participants identified through simple random 
sampling. Validity and reliability was used to ascertain the credibility of research tools and a 
number of ethical issues such as confidentiality, Anonymity, and plagiarism was adhered to during 
data collected. This methodology was crucial in fulfilling the study objectives. 
2.6 Chapter Summary  
This study used a qualitative research approach in exploring the impact of volunteering in an 
agency and its impact on self-satisfaction in Bukhalu sub-county, Bulambuli District. This 
qualitative approach entailed presenting and analyzing data collected through interviews through 
logical techniques to describe and illustrate, summarize and recap, and evaluate data. The aim of 
this mythology is to enable the attainment of non-biased findings of the study and this enabled the 
replication of research findings.

Age of participants 
The general and demographic information indicate that participants belonged to different age 
groups. The difference in the age was an important component of selecting respondents for the 
study, which helped in obtaining different information and also shows maturity in the collected 
information. In this regard, the selected and interviewed participants were from 18-25, 26-33 and 
34 above. Here, the purpose was to find out the average age of participants in the study and it was 
discovered that majority of the participants (10) were in the age bracket of 34 and above. The 

31 
 
above view indicated that participant’s added value to the responses given that mature participants 
are more trustable as they take time to think about a particular aspect of life before giving reliable 
responses.  
Gender of participants 
According to the findings of the findings of the study, Nine (09) participants were males and 
females were Six (6). This implies that the male participants were the majority hence most of the 
data was collected from male participants. 
Educational level of participants 
Data showed that majority of the participants (09) had acquired secondary education. This meant 
that they easily understood questions in the interview guide and their views were well informed. 
Uma (2017) asserted that it is important in social investigation research to involve people that have 
attained an acceptable level of literacy and numeracy in order to be in position to understand and 
interpret contents of the interviews. 
For purposes of anonymity, the following codes were used: 
LL   =   local leader 1-5 
LP  =  local people 1-5 
NGO staffs = Staffs from NGO 1-5

CHAPTER FIVE 
DISCUSSION OF STUDY FINDINGS 
5.1 Introduction 
The study explored the impact of volunteering in an agency and its impact on self-satisfaction in 
Bukhalu sub-county, Bulambuli District. Specifically, the study explored the different 
volunteering types that exist and the impact of volunteering in an agency on self-satisfaction in 
Bukhalu sub-county, Bulambuli District. The study also investigated factors that hinder 
volunteering in an agency in Bukhalu sub-county, Bulambuli District. 
The study discovered that several types of volunteering exist and these include volunteering in 
schools, corporate volunteering, community volunteer work and welfare volunteering. Findings 
also revealed that Volunteerism in an agency can have several impacts on self-satisfaction in 
several ways such as it is relevant for people of all ages as a source of social capital and goodwill 
and this helps to enhance self-satisfaction, volunteerism is an important pathway for enhancing youth 
employment and employability, particularly through impacting transferable soft skills that 
educational institutions often fail to address, Volunteering is associated with better mental health 
in older adulthood and because volunteering could enlarge social network size, its effects would 
be more pronounced for people who have fewer social contacts. 
 
Additionally, findings revealed that several factors hinder volunteering in an agency such as a lack 
of time or interest and health problems, people don’t have information about where to volunteer, 
or if they do, the jobs are not meaningful or purposeful, absence of volunteering programmes for 
people and potential volunteers can be discouraged by formal recruitment procedures such as 
completing a long registration form or attending an interview 
 
These findings are in line with a range of past studies (see chapter Two) where authors presented 
an extended exposition of historical antecedents of the present situation regarding teenage 

41 
 
pregnancies and its relationship to girl’s education. Although some authors (eg., Ojangole et al., 
2022 and Davis, 2021) failed to address the issue in an increasingly exploited range, the findings 
of this study matches the subtlety and rigor of the subject matter (the role of family support in the 
rehabilitation of persons with alcohol addiction).  
This chapter presents the discussions of the study findings in line with the study findings identified 
earlier in chapter four and the discussions have been done in line with the three specific objectives 
of the study. The purpose of this chapter is to present the findings of data analysis in a systematic 
way and to give all evidence related to research objectives and questions as seen below: 
5.2 Discussion 
The discussion of the findings is presented as below: 
 
Types of Volunteering that Exist 
Study participants were asked to mention the various types of volunteering that exist and their 
responses were: Volunteering in schools, corporate volunteering, community volunteer work and 
welfare volunteering 
 
The finding of the study shows that volunteering in schools is one form of volunteering available. 
This is line with the findings of World Bank (2021) where it was reported that volunteering in 
schools is one form of volunteering available. 
The findings of the study also show that corporate volunteering is existing form of volunteering. 
This finding is in line with the findings of the study by Mwiria et al., (2019) who also argued that 
corporate volunteering is existing form of volunteering 
Findings also revealed that community volunteer work is also a common form of volunteering. 
Esearch by Kisan et al., (2017) supports these findings where was discovered that community 
volunteer work is also a common form of volunteering 
Additionally, welfare volunteering is a form of volunteering. Even ILO (2020) found that welfare 
volunteering is a form of volunteering.
