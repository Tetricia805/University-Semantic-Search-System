ABSTRACT 
This study Assesses the Impact of the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act) 2022 on the 
practice of digital journalism a case study of Uganda Christian University. This study seeks 
to establish the loopholes within the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act) 2022 which are 
liable for exploitation by narrow interest groups, it further addresses how these loopholes 
have hindered the advancement of digital journalism and how the loopholes found can be 
bridged. The study employs qualitative methods, including questionnaires, and content 
analysis, to assess the impact of the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act) 2022 on digital 
journalism practices. This study contributes to the existing literature on digital journalism by 
establishing their channels or mode of operation in the digital world, it further elaborates in-
depth on the origins and provisions of the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act) 2022. Using a 
theoretical framework based on Authoritative theory, the study assesses how the Act is a tool 
for the suppression of digital press freedom in their quest to collect, gather, produce, and 
share content online. It also highlights the significance of media freedom in a bid for nation-
building, accountability, and having an informed society.

                                                        CHAPTER ONE 
                                                       INTRODUCTION 
1.0 Background 
Digital journalism practices in Uganda have been facing immense pressure from government 
regulations, policies, and laws. The existence of widespread misinformation, disinformation, 
fake news, and propaganda has led to limitations on digital journalism through internet 
restrictions and policies (Florence, 2021). However, these policies were first introduced by 
the colonial masters (Britain) in 1954, when the media industry was introduced in Uganda. 
The Uganda Broadcasting Cooperation (UBC), which was a state-owned BBC, undertook an 
authoritarian theory of mass media that censored freedom of journalism practices, limiting it 
to the promotion of British propaganda at the expense of ordinary Ugandans who demanded a 
libertarian theory that anticipates equality and freedom in journalism practices. In addition, 
the British used it to suppress the activities of Pan-Africanists such as I.K Musaazi, who were 
outspoken about the British state of governance by demanding policy reviews and political 
inclusion (Bob, 2012). With the evolution of the internet or the digital era, accessibility, and 
dissemination of information have increased, giving birth to digital journalism practices 
among student journalists, professionals, and citizen journalists within Uganda Christian 
University, Mukono. This involves sharing media content through the internet as opposed to 
print or broadcast. However, online sharing of content has been associated with falsification, 
distortion, disinformation, misinformation, and propaganda, attracting numerous policies in a 
bid to curb, discourage, and limit their distribution. These policies include the Computer 
Misuse (Amendment Act), which has in turn crippled digital journalism practices in regard to 
unlawful exposure and sharing of information or data from fraud, embezzlement of funds, 
corruption, misuse of public offices, human rights violations, and other activities that render 
any journalism practice a public watchdog and accountable to the society (Carl-Magnus 
Höglund & Johan Karlsson Schaffer, 2021).  
In this study, I intend to examine the limitations that the amended Computer Misuse Act of 
2022 presents to digital journalism practices, the loopholes that may exist within the 
provisions of the policy, and the framework within which media practitioners or journalists 
can still operate despite the sabotaging implications of the policy. 
 

2 
 
1.1 Problem Statement 
The Computer Misuse (Amendment Act) has imposed restrictions on digital journalism 
practices in Uganda, making it difficult for journalists to create, upload, disseminate, and 
distribute content online. Journalists in Kampala and other neighboring districts have faced 
various penalties as a result of this law, including house and office searches, seizure of 
computer-related properties, threats, and arrests. For instance, Pidson Kakaire, the managing 
editor of Drone Media, was charged with criminal libel and offensive communication under 
this law. Dr. Stella Nyanzi, a human rights activist, was also arrested and charged with cyber 
harassment and offensive communication (Michael, Anke F. and Kerem, 2016). The 
Computer Misuse (Amendment Act) prohibits the unauthorized sharing of information or 
data electronically, the sending and sharing of malicious or unsolicited information, and the 
misuse of social media activities. These provisions pose a significant threat to digital 
journalism, including public watchdog function, accountability function, and dissemination of 
information. It makes it illegal to access information or data without authorization, which can 
lead to penalties. The study also navigates how these loopholes influence journalism 
practices. 
According to Mr. Asuman Odaka, the Secretary-General of the National Economic 
Empowerment Dialogue Party (NEEDP), the Computer Misuse Act of 2022 puts the practice 
of journalism on the brink of collapse in Uganda. Therefore, this study aims to identify the 
loopholes within the framework of this law that can end up crippling the progress of Digital 
journalism and that can be exploited by different parties with narrow interest. The study will 
help establish the limitations brought about by the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act) and 
its impact on digital journalism practices in Uganda. 
1.2 General Purpose 
The main objective of this study is to analyze the limitations imposed by the amended 
Computer Misuse Act of 2022 on Digital journalism in Uganda Christian University. The 
study aims to identify any potential loopholes within the law that could allow digital 
journalism practices to continue legally and to evaluate the existence of a framework for 
journalists to operate within the law. The research also seeks to explore the legal implications 
of the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act) on the practice of journalism in Uganda Christian 
University. 
 

3 
 
1.3 Objectives of the Study 
• To assess the extent to which digital journalism practices have been limited by 
the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act) within Uganda Christian University, 
Mukono. 
• To find out how digital journalists can practice within the parameters of the 
Computer Misuse (Amendment Act) at Uganda Christian University, Mukono. 
• To examine loopholes within the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act) regarding 
digital journalism practices at Uganda Christian University, Mukono. 
1.4 Research Questions 
RQ1: What are the loopholes within the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act), 2022 that are 
liable to exploitation by narrow interest parties? 
 
RQ2: How can these loopholes hinder the advancement of Digital journalism practices? 
RQ3: How can these loopholes be bridged? 
1.5 The Scope of the Study 
This study intends to examine the impact of the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act) on the 
Journalism practice at Uganda Christian University, Mukono. In addition, it seeks to identify 
the existing framework within which Digital journalism practices can operate despite efforts 
to sabotage its activities and to assess loopholes or unconstitutionality existing within the law. 
The study targets Digital journalists who have been directly limited by the Computer Misuse 
(Amendment Act); it also seeks to understand how Digital journalists can operate within the 
framework of the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act). 
1.5.1 Geographical Scope 
This study intends to cover the Uganda Christian University, Mukono district. This is in order 
to investigate the extent to at the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act) has limited Digital 
journalism practices within the institution especially among student journalists, and 
professional journalists operating within the University. In addition, analyze possible 
similarities and differences in those limitations. It is also intended to examine and establish a 
framework within which Digital journalists in these districts can work within the framework 
of the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act) and to conclusively identify loopholes within the 
Computer Misuse (Amendment Act) 

4 
 
1.5.2 Content Scope 
This study intends to assess Digital journalists including professional journalists, student 
journalists, and Citizen journalists who have practically participated in pre-production, 
production, post-production, and distribution of online content through platforms such as 
Facebook, Twitter(X), YouTube, Instagram, and Websites. This is aimed at examining their 
experiences while distributing online content within the provisions of the Computer Misuse 
(Amendment Act) and the limitations faced in the process. The study also aims to examine 
legal experts on allegations that the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act) possesses Acts that 
are unconstitutional (loopholes) with the sole purpose of discouraging online activism and 
scrutinization of government apparatus. In conclusion, the content scope of the study is 
desired to establish a framework within which Digital journalists can disseminate news 
content online without contradicting the law in mention. 
1.5.3 Time Scope 
The study intends to cover a time period of four (4) months, this is based on the analogy that 
news-worthy events and happenings transpire on a daily basis, and with Digital journalism 
practices at hand, the speed at which content production and distribution is relatively high 
due to the accessibility ease that online platforms such as Twitter(X), Facebook, Instagram, 
YouTube, and Websites provide to the respective audiences. Therefore, a period of four 
months offers ample time to examine the limitations faced in the process of content 
production and dissemination by Digital journalists. In addition, it should also be able to 
establish a framework within which Digital journalists can still produce content and distribute 
without contradicting the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act) and finally to assess legal 
experts on the unconstitutionality through loopholes that are within the provisions of the 
Computer Misuse (Amendment Act). 
1.6 Justification of the Study 
This study is imperative on the following counts; 
• It will identify, assess, and define various limitations initiated on Digital journalism 
practices by the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act). In addition, it focuses on 
examining the existence of unconstitutional provisions within the Computer Misuse 
(Amendment Act) also termed as loopholes, especially in regard to Digital journalism 
roles and purposes of serving public interests through scrutinization and demanding 

5 
 
accountability of government apparatus by exposing corruption scandals, bribery, 
fraud, embezzlement of public funds and abuse of public offices among others. 
• It will establish an existing framework within which Digital journalism practices can 
still operate consistently within the constraints of the Computer Misuse (Amendment 
Act), this is purposely to avoid contradictions that may unfold while producing and 
distributing online content and also to minimize the criminalization of the production 
of online content that serves public interest. 
1.7 Significance of the Study 
This study is relatively significant on the following fronts; 
• This study will establish the extent to which the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act) 
has limited Digital journalism practices within online spaces in Mukono. In addition, 
it will clearly show how these limitations on Digital journalism practices have led to 
widespread unaccountability and reduced follow-up on issues of public interest for 
example corruption scandals, abuse of public offices, and embezzlement of public 
funds because of hindrances brought by provisions such as accessing unauthorized, 
malicious and unsolicited information. 
•  This study will establish a framework within which Digital journalists including 
professionals, students, and citizen journalists within Mukono can still practice within 
the constraints of the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act). This is aimed at 
maintaining the coherence of the practice due to the accessibility and favorable 
conditions offered by digital platforms such as Websites, Search engines, Facebook, 
Twitter(X), Instagram, and YouTube. 
• The research findings of this study will not only benefit Digital or online journalists 
by 
outlining 
the 
limitations, 
and 
existing 
framework 
and 
establishing 
unconstitutionality that requires reforms but also civic organizations and societies 
who share influential content and ideologies online will get to continue with their 
practices through the aid of the research findings of this study. 
1.8 Theoretical Framework 
The theoretical framework of this study is based on the approaches of the critical, libertarian, 
normative, and authoritarian theories of media because they are largely associated with 
authorities and press freedoms as seen below; 

6 
 
Andrew Feeberg (2008) stated that the dynamics of the critical theory in the communication 
technological era have changed, this is because it provides a primary preposition to societal 
issues of public interest. In addition, it further indicates that the internet provides innovational 
structures that collectively unify respective audiences. 
The study conveys the approaches of the Libertarian theory of media with an interest in the 
evolution of media through digitalization, which states that people are rational beings who are 
capable of distinguishing right and wrong, Kimumwe (2020) further states that man should be 
accorded equal rights and opportunities to express oneself. In regards to digital journalism 
practices, professionals, students, and citizen journalists should conceptualize, produce, and 
distribute online content that is of public interest and impactful to society without limitations 
brought by the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act). 
This study further navigates that for new policies such as the Computer Misuse (Amendment 
Act) to prevail, the normative theory of media is put into consideration since it states an ideal 
framework through which media systems are operated by the state, authority, and 
governments. In addition, it stresses media relations with political administrations rather than 
media and public interests such as scrutiny and accountability. 
This study also hints at the authoritarian theory of media which states that man is weak 
insinuating that he is overshadowed by the powers and authority of the state and 
governments. In addition, it highlights that the media is meant to serve the functionalities and 
interests of the state which includes propaganda manifestations and brutalization of 
democratic processes and participation such as elections in a bid to favor them (Anne, 2019) 
In the next chapter, Literature Review, the study aims to define Digital journalism, Digital 
journalists, and Computer Misuse (Amendment Act), and how they have affected each other 
in the same sphere.

                                                      LITERATURE REVIEW 
2.0 Introduction 
This chapter aims at defining the concept of Digital journalism, the Computer Misuse 
(Amendment Act), and establishing how the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act) has 
affected Digital journalism since its enactment (Mackenzie, 2023). It also strives to further 
investigate how researchers and scholars have assessed the limitations brought about by the 
Computer Misuse (Amendment Act) on the practice of Digital journalism, its impact on the 
practice after limitations, and existing unconstitutionalities or loopholes within the law.  
2.1 Understanding Digital Journalism 
This section explores the definition of Digital journalism using different approaches as seen 
below; 
Digital journalism is the production and distribution of news resources on digital spaces such 
as Websites and Social Media platforms such as Twitter(X), Facebook, Instagram, and 
YouTube among others (Deuze & Witschege, 2018). In addition, Digital journalism is a 
networking that incorporates the production and dissemination of news and informational 
resources (Silvio, 2019) Many scholars have hardly desegregated both digital and traditional 
journalism in the aspect of consistency and news sourcing, but the tools employed in the 
process of collecting information distinguishes them (Ferucci, 2017) 
Hermida (2010) defines journalism in the digital era as moving journalism or journalism in 
motion. The process of filtering relevant issues is the new phenomenon governing journalism 
practices in the online or digital space (Franklin, 2013, p. 1). Under digitization, journalists 
are availed with more chances which presents new bounds in the line of Analytics, audience, 
and algorithms. Under digitization, the most notable changes are between content consumers 
and producers, the agenda setting in media has changed since it has incorporated the public or 
audiences as well. In the online or digital era, the consumers of news resources have turned 
into news producers due to easy accessibility to online platforms such as Websites and social 
media platforms. Therefore, this gives rise to digital journalists who may not necessarily be 
professionals in the field. (Loosen, 2014) 

8 
 
It should be noted that Digital journalism practices have become instrumental in the field of 
policymaking, this is due to new challenges and concerns brought by the new technologies 
pertaining to privacy and information security especially the unsolicited, unauthorized, and 
malicious messages that are aimed at blackmailing, spreading propaganda and issues of 
public interest. Apparently, these concerns about digitization have paved the way for policies 
like the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act) with provisions such as abuse of social media, 
and unsolicited and unauthorized information among others with heavy fines and prison 
sentences accorded in violation. 
The following explanations establish the 5Ws and H of Digital journalism as seen below; 
• Who 
Digital journalism does not limit its definition to certified professionals in the field, 
but with the technological advancements, whoever has access to the internet and can 
supply news resources and commentaries into the online or digital domain qualifies to 
be a digital journalist. (Lewis & Westlund, 2015) 
Journalistic identity has undergone recession, this digitization has given birth to new 
journalism dynamics including citizen journalism hence infiltrating the environment 
once dominated by professional journalists (Knight, Geuze, and Gerlis 2008; Singer 
2003) 
• What 
The content arrays of digital journalism include articles, blogs on a website, YouTube 
videos, audio, news headlines, editorials, and art reviews. In addition, has also led to 
the evolution of new content such as podcasts, reviews, fake news, rumors, and 
misinformation among others. 
• Where they operate, 
Digital journalism is not affected or limited geographically. This is because content 
can be uploaded and disseminated through websites, social media platforms, and 
search engines with high speed and accessibility courtesy of connections through Wi-
Fi or internet data. 
• When 
Digital journalism knows no time, this is attributed to its speed where content is 
distributed, redistributed, posted, and re-posted within a short time via wireless 
channels and networks. These wireless channels and networks are due to the 

9 
 
advancement in technology or digitization which is achieved through the 
electromagnetic spectrum which comprises wavelength and frequencies. 
• Why 
Digital journalism is in place for various reasons ranging from content creation for 
advertisement, income generation through sponsorships and endorsements, the 
scrutinization of government apparatus, informing, educating, and entertaining 
through content, it further acts as an influential tool on the public, to create awareness. 
• How 
Digital journalism encompasses a free accessibility environment with no defined rules 
especially in terms of procedure and ethical grounds while creating and publishing 
content online. In addition, it lacks specific ways in which content should be availed 
to the public. 
2.2 Understanding the Computer Misuse (Amendment) Act 
This section defines the provisions of the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act) regarding 
Digital journalism practices; 
The Computer Misuse (Amendment Act) was signed into law by the President of Uganda 
H.E Yoweri Museveni in 2022. This policy was moved on the floor of parliament by 
Kampala Central Member of Parliament Hon. Muhammad Nsereko to reform the Computer 
Misuse Act 2011 which was considered outdated. This move was backed by the idea that 
technological advancements had introduced new issues, threats, and concerns that needed 
urgent addressing. 
Goitom (2023) further asserts that the government of Uganda signed the Computer Misuse 
(Amendment Act) into law on the basis that transformations had taken place in the 
technological sphere without clear reforms or changes in the policies and laws governing 
them. In addition, the digitization era introduced new types of content for example fake news, 
misinformation which posed a threat to privacy and information security thus prompting the 
government to sign into law the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act) which introduces new 
provisions criminalizing some practices within Digital journalism including Abuse of social 
media, Unauthorized Access, Unsolicited Information and Malicious Information among 
others.  
 

10 
 
The following are some of the provisions of the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act) that 
limit Digital journalism practices according to Goitom (2023); 
• Unauthorized Access to Information, 
This provision states that anybody who gains access to another person’s information 
or program, records video or audio of another: or disseminates information about or 
that seems related to another, commits an offence. In addition, it places heavy 
penalties of fines of up to 15 million shillings or a prison sentence below ten (10) 
years or both. 
• Unsolicited Information, 
This provision states that Digital journalists should only disseminate information 
concerning somebody else for example government officials only when they are in the 
public interest, this is cited on the basis that unsolicited information may be without a 
person’s consent and hence can lead to reputational damage. 
This provision not only distorts the agenda-setting theory of media but also minimizes 
media relevance in the internet era where anybody with digital accessibility can easily 
set the topic of discussion. 
Upon violation of this policy and conviction, one can serve up to seven (7) years of 
incarceration and a fine of fifteen (15) million shillings or both. 
• Social Media Abuse, 
This provision criminalizes the distribution of informational content in contradictions 
with the domestic laws of Uganda under concealed identity or disguising with 
informational resources belonging to others. This provision limits Digital journalism 
practices, especially in cases where content has to be held undercover to avoid 
unnecessary leakages that can cause public outcry or image distortion. 
It carries a fine of about 15 million shillings, a jail term of less than 5 years, or both 
upon conviction. 
2.3 Digital Journalism Vs Computer Misuse (Amendment) Act 
This sub-section explores how the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act) and Digital 
journalism practices have affected each other; 
Many scholars agree that the Computer Misuse Amendment Act (2022) was proposed, 
enacted, and signed into law with the sole aim of restricting Digital journalism practices. This 
is because they scrutinize government bodies, demand accountability, and perform the public

watchdog role using platforms like Twitter(X), YouTube, and Instagram among others. In 
addition, they also use sophisticated computer programs to monitor media activities online. 
Upon examining online restrictions through laws like the Computer Misuse Amendment Act 
(2022), different scholars, authors, and schools of thought agree that these policies undermine 
international human rights standards; they further state that these policies lack a framework 
of validity, legitimateness, rightness, and necessity. Through observation, researchers have 
conclusively assessed that domestic cyber laws in Uganda are often unverified and executed 
with minimal monitoring (Florence, 2021) 
The initial target of the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act) was to primarily litigate and 
intimidate free online sharing of information by Digital Journalists from accessing and 
disseminating unauthorized information of public interest for example corruption scandals, 
fraud, bribery, embezzlement of public funds and incompetence among government officials. 
It has in turn been used to truncate the activities of these online journalists who offer forums 
that scrutinize, reduce inadequacies, and hold the government accountable for all business 
done in public offices from health structures, education systems, and public service delivery 
among others (Matsiko and Kersting, 2023). It should be noted that the media industry 
underwent numerous transitional changes under the Museveni regime, especially regarding 
regulations and policies, this is evident through the Computer Misuse Act of 2011 (amended 
2022) among others. Dr. Emily Maractho alludes that for the administration and evolution of 
media in Uganda to be probed, the legal structures and policies have to be thoroughly 
conveyed (Maractho, 2015) 
It should be noted that in countries like Uganda, exercising political rights is limited to 
elections which are often characterized by violence, abductions, rigging, and tribal 
affiliations. Therefore, online platforms or Computer-mediated communication tools avail 
new measures in political participation which includes awareness from Digital journalists and 
activists through tools such as Twitter(X), Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube to rally for 
infrastructural, administrational, and policy improvements in the line of health, education and 
service delivery (Matsiko and Kersting, 2023). Therefore, this suggests that limiting the 
activities of Digital journalists with the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act) not only 
undermines freedom of expression but also hinders efforts to fight for the restoration of 
credibility, consistency, and accountability of the state apparatus. 

12 
 
Different scholars allude that the existence of the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act) has 
not only sabotaged Digital journalism practices but also the public or masses who are denied 
opportunities to participate and advocate for free and fair governance systems through 
activism (McIntyre and Meghan, 2021). For Digital journalism practices to be free, the public 
or masses must determine what they expect from that particular media apparatus (public 
agenda setting) (Michael Meyen et al., 2016) 
Digital Journalists in Uganda consider themselves as mediators, or interposition themselves 
as part of the public hence making them cover stories on issues affecting or happening within 
their particular spheres of influence. However, some Digital journalists affiliate more with the 
state functions than their role as the fourth estate or watchdog which asserts the Normative 
theory of mass media (McIntyre & Meghan, 2021). This also constitutes why Digital 
journalism practices are faced with less solidarity moves by internet service providers who 
often comply with government policies to protect their entities instead of customers or users 
for example MTN which supports all government positions in line with image and brand 
protection (Florence, 2021) 
Mackenzie (2023) asserts that regulating online or Digital journalism practices specifically 
targets both the Users of online platforms for example Websites, Facebook, Twitter(X), 
Instagram, YouTube, and the platforms themselves. This also instigates that regulations are 
intended to discourage interactivity and engagement of users online specifically on political 
topics, and matters of public interest, and also to persuade the digital platforms mentioned 
above to synchronize content shared on their spaces, therefore calling for these platforms to 
be wary of emerging domestic policies to maintain accessibility from wider geographical 
scopes.

CHAPTER THREE 
METHODOLOGY 
3.0 Introduction 
This module explores the methodological approach and research design of this study. It relies 
entirely on navigating concepts, experiences, and opinions of digital journalists, scholars, and 
legal experts to guide the ideological approach. It assesses the qualitative approach used in 
this study. It further addresses the data collection methods including questionnaires, 
interviews, and focus group discussions. This module also dispenses analytical processes and 
data interpretation techniques including reliability and validity. In conclusion, this module 
defines the ethical considerations and limitations of this study.  
3.1 The Research Design 
Lelissa (2018) describes research design as the process of gathering, analyzing, and 
interpreting research content or data. This intends to link the problem statement concerns 
with the experiences, opinions, and concepts of digital journalism scholars and practitioners. 
This states that the research design establishes the process of needed content or data, the 
methodology applicable to find out the data, and how analysis will be done in a manner that 
responds to the research questions which include: the limitations facing digital journalism 
under the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act), the existing framework within which digital 
journalism can be practiced and the unconstitutionalities or loopholes existing within the 
Computer Misuse (Amendment Act) in regards to digital journalism practices. 
This study uses descriptive and explanatory approaches that offer ground reality to the 
limitations faced by digital journalism while practicing their craft under this law, what and 
why there could be unconstitutionalities within the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act) in 
regards to digital journalism practices and how digital journalism practices can prevail 
without contradicting with the provisions of the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act). These 
approaches seek to establish factors that lead to happenings for example reason and cause. In 
addition, they offer backup evidence of their existence since they compare constraints and 
relationships between various aspects relating to the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act) and 
digital journalism practices (Lelissa, 2018). 
 

14 
 
The main goal of this study is to examine the impact of the Computer Misuse (Amendment 
Act) on digital journalism practices in Mukono. Therefore, different scholarly concepts, 
opinions, and experiences of digital journalism practitioners have to be assessed using 
methods such as interviews, questionnaires, and focus group discussions to establish the 
qualitative study design. 
3.2 The Case Study Design 
The case study design focuses on the qualitative research approach which offers various 
means of internalizing happenings or events for example through reviewing concepts and 
interacting with digital journalism practitioners to get opinions and experiences. Therefore, 
the qualitative approach generalizes in unraveling how the Computer Misuse (Amendment 
Act) and digital journalism practices have influenced one another within the Mukono setting. 
This further states that the qualitative approach of research puts much emphasis on 
establishing how phenomena transpire in case they co-exist in the same sphere or whenever 
one is meant to regulate the other for example the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act) as a 
policy was set to regulate the activities of computer-mediated forms of communication which 
includes digital journalism practices. 
3.2.0 Justification  
Qualitative research approaches will investigate and produce in-depth accounts of the 
concepts, perspectives, and experiences of the participants involved for example in this case 
the digital journalism practitioners, media scholars, and legal experts within Uganda 
Christian University. (Creswell, & Plano Clark, 2011; Munhall, 2012; Wuest, 2012; 
Holloway & Galvin, 2016). Qualitative research will navigate how digital journalism 
practices can continue within the existing framework of the Computer Misuse (Amendment 
Act), it also establishes the loopholes within the provisions of the Computer Misuse 
(Amendment Act) and some of the limitations brought by the Computer Misuse (Amendment 
Act) on the practice of digital journalism, these are all through subjecting participants such as 
digital journalism practitioners, media scholars and legal experts to the descriptive natures of 
the research questions that can lead to responses that inform the existing situation(Curry et 
al., 2009; Yin, 2015). The qualitative approach enables the researcher to possess and have 
consistency in straightforwardness and responsibility throughout the research process hence 
enabling the readers to identify critical analytical decisions made by the researcher. 

15 
 
However, the qualitative approach of research does not convert symbols used verbally while 
expressing oneself into mathematical numbers or digits (Hogan et al., 2009; Sarantakos, 
2013; Holloway & Galvin, 2016). 
3.3 Sampling 
This study seeks to identify and locate digital journalism practitioners within Uganda 
Christian University, Mukono. This is because the institution is home to the School of 
Journalism, media, and Communication which comprises Media scholars, digital journalism 
practitioners, and student journalists who have practiced before or still practicing the art. 
Therefore, sampling will enable the collection of rich information and data regarding the 
impact of Digital Journalism on Computer Misuse (Amendment Act) from Uganda Christian 
University as a sampling base (Paton, 1990; Marshall & Rossman, 2014). 
3.4 Research Techniques 
This study will explore several techniques in a bid to gather data and information on the 
impact of the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act) on digital journalism practices in Mukono. 
These techniques include interviews and focus group discussions. 
3.4.1 Interviews 
Under this study, different participants including Digital journalism practitioners, media 
scholars, and legal experts from Uganda Christian University, Mukono will be subjected to 
interview-based evaluations which will include question-asking and answer-responses. This 
is intended to produce comprehensive information or data about the impact of the Computer 
Misuse (Amendment Act) on Digital journalism practices in Mukono. This information will 
be extracted from the experiences, concepts, and perspectives of these contributors. To gather 
rigorous information about the limitations brought by the Computer Misuse (Amendment 
Act) on digital journalism practices, the framework within which digital journalism practices 
can be practiced without contradicting the provisions of the Computer Misuse (Amendment 
Act), and finally the loopholes or unconstitutionalities existing within the provisions of the 
Computer Misuse (Amendment Act). In conclusion, the results obtained from the interview 
sessions are supposed to inform and justify the qualitative approach (Grey, 2014). 
These interview sessions will incorporate shaped questions to source the needed information 
calculatedly, they will further aid in availing explanations and ensuring connectivity with the 

16 
 
topic; Impacts of the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act) on Digital Journalism Practices in 
Mukono (Gill et al., 2010). 
3.4.2 Focus Group Discussion 
This study intends to use focus group discussions to obtain or gather comprehensive 
information from the group discussions. These group discussions will involve designated 
groups of Digital journalism practitioners including student journalists at Uganda Christian 
University with previous experiences in practicing Digital journalism before and after the 
Computer Misuse (Amendment Act). This is intended to investigate their concepts, 
experiences, and perspectives about the impact of the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act) on 
Digital journalism practices (Morgan, 1996). In addition, the study further explores 
incorporating respondent moderator focus group form of discussion. This will involve a few 
selected Digital journalism practitioners participating in the discussion to take up roles such 
as provisional group coordinators (Kamberelis & Dimitriadis, 2005). This is intended to 
reverberate the rest of the participants to give or exhibit independent responses, this idea was 
put into consideration to enable the participants freedom to discuss their concepts, 
experiences, and perspectives. In addition, the autonomy of answers shared in the discussion 
increases the depth and variety of concepts, experiences, and perspectives without mere 
repetitions. In conclusion, the focus group discussions of data collection give room for 
straightforward and frank answers which are needed to cultivate the gaps identified by this 
study. 
3.5 Data Collection 
This study will explore the use of interviews and focus group discussions in collecting data or 
information on the impacts of the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act) for example the 
research question: What are some of the limitations brought by the Computer Misuse 
(Amendment Act) on digital journalism practices will be addressed using both interviews and 
focus group discussion to widen the resulting scope, the research question on how digital 
journalism practices can work within the framework of the Computer Misuse (Amendment 
Act) will be subjected to focus group discussions to verify what the majority think or regard 
as appropriate. The research question regarding the unconstitutionality will be subjected to 
both interviews and focus group discussion to create a critical analysis of the concept. Most 
of the research questions will incorporate all the data collection techniques because the 

17 
 
presence of the researcher is vital regarding the degree of transparency. In addition, it adds 
validity to the result or outcome of the research process (Holloway, 2005; Creswell, 2007) 
3.6 Data Analysis 
Under this stage, different analytical approaches will be explored to review and preview the 
experiences, perspectives, and concepts of the participants. This is intended to determine the 
outcomes of the research study on the impact of Computer Misuse (Amendment Act) on 
Digital journalism practices in Mukono. These approaches include thematic analysis, content 
review analysis, and Narrative analysis. 
• Thematic Approach 
This approach incorporates identifying repeated views or perspectives in a collection 
of data or information. In this study, this approach will be used to address responses 
to research questions such as; What are some of the limitations brought by the 
Computer Misuse (Amendment Act) on Digital journalism practices in all the data 
collection methods including interviews and focus group discussions. This is intended 
to enable the identification of any repeated views or ideas from the participants 
(Leonard & David, 2016). 
• Content Review 
Under this approach, reviews will be done on previous texts and declarations that 
have been produced in line with the impact of the Computer Misuse (Amendment 
Act) on the practice of Digital journalism through examining texts, key highlights, 
and various concepts of media scholars or Digital journalism practitioners to analyze 
the existence, interpretations, and similarities of those texts, highlights and conceptual 
analogies from the focus group discussions and interviews(A.J, Kheinheksel, et.al,). 
• Narrative Approaches 
This explores Digital journalism practitioners as examples and concentrates on 
establishing their narration of data and seeks to build knowledge based on the 
experiences of Digital journalism practitioners while creating content before and after 
the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act). This is through identifying coordinating 
sequences within the narrations of Digital journalism practitioners as they discuss 
their experiences before and after the signing of the Computer Misuse (Amendment 
Act). This approach also seeks to examine what digital journalism practitioners think 
about the possible unconstitutionalities within the provisions of the law (Josselson, R., 

18 
 
& Hammack P.L., 2021). This approach can contextualize and energize the 
perspectives of digital journalism practitioners affected by the Computer Misuse 
(Amendment Act). 
3.7 Quality Control 
This study intends to undertake the reliability and validity procedure in maintaining the levels 
of information or data and the data collection methods such as interviews and focus group 
discussions. These quality control approaches will provide the readers with reliable and 
validated research outcomes which aims at furthering more research information in the field 
of Digital journalism and the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act). 
3.7.1 Reliability 
This study will determine reliability by creating provisions for an in-depth description of the 
procedures and mechanisms which will offer other researchers a basis to gather their data or 
information with the same criteria (Firmin, 2008). It will also allow new researchers to carry 
on work, especially those with matching research questions (Saumure & Given, 2008) 
3.7.2 Validity 
This segment of quality control will cultivate internal validity to determine the extent to 
which data collected from interviews or focus group discussions represents ground reality or 
ground examples. It will further navigate the methods of research and the contributors in this 
case who include Digital journalism practitioners about the expression and presumptions of 
the researcher (McMillan & Schumacher, 2006). To attain validity, this study will carefully 
define the data in-depth, clearly indicating unfavorable and contentious issues using other 
researchers to assess the outcomes articulately, fact-checking and analysis, 
3.8 Ethical Considerations 
This study intends to minimize threats aimed at reducing the integral aspect of Digital 
journalism practitioners (Polit & Beck, 2010; Neuman, 2011, Munhall, 2012). This further 
insinuates that the participants will include entirely Digital journalism practitioners who 
comprise professional journalists, citizen journalists, and student journalists. They will 
further be subjected to the optimum ethical procedures regarding their independence, forceful 
participation, secrecy, and privacy (Neuman, 2011; Scott, 2013). In addition, clarity and 
responsibility will be presented regarding the procedure and conduct of the research by 
clearly establishing how the participants' consent was assessed, illustrating how 

19 
 
confidentiality was protected. The readers shall be made aware of the inclusion process of the 
participants, who in this case are Digital journalism practitioners. 
3.9 Limitations to the Study 
This study is limited to data collection methods that require the presence of the researcher 
including interviews and focus group discussions. Methods like questionnaires and surveys 
which are more cost-friendly may not be applicable due to honesty concerns and the desire 
for the researchers to get involved face-to-face with the research participants who are Digital 
journalism practitioners to understand their reactions as they explain or narrate their ordeals 
while practicing Digital journalism under the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act). 
This study also faces limitations on researched studies specifically on Digital journalism and 
Computer Misuse (Amendment Act) with questions such as; What are the limitations facing 
Digital journalism practices under the provisions of the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act), 
How can Digital journalism practitioners practice within the parameters of the Computer 
Misuse (Amendment Act).

CHAPTER FOUR 
DATA INTERPRETATION & PRESENTATION OF RESULTS 
4.0 Introduction 
The data collected for this research is based on the guidance of research questions including:  
1. What are the loopholes within the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act), 2022 that are 
liable to exploitation by narrow interest parties? 
2. How can these loopholes hinder the advancement of Digital journalism practices? 
3. How can these loopholes be bridged? 
The following objectives guide these research questions; 
• To assess the extent to which digital journalism practices have been limited by 
the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act) within Uganda Christian University, 
Mukono. 
• To find out how digital journalists can practice within the parameters of the 
Computer Misuse (Amendment Act) at Uganda Christian University, Mukono. 
• To examine loopholes within the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act) regarding 
digital journalism practices at Uganda Christian University, Mukono. 
Data interpretation is a crucial stage in the research process, as it enables researchers to make 
sense of their findings, identify patterns, and draw meaningful conclusions (Bryman, 2016). 
The purpose of data interpretation is to: 
1. Identify patterns and relationships:  
(i) 
Patterns 
The goal of data interpretation is to uncover patterns and relationships in the data that can 
help answer the research question (Creswell, 2014, p. 245). Meanwhile, a trend is a consistent 
change in the data over time or across categories (Creswell, 2014, p. 240). A correlation 
indicates a relationship between two or more variables (Bryman, 2016, p. 338). Clusters can 
be described as groups of cases that share similar characteristics (Merriam, 2009, p. 213). 
Outliers are data points that deviate significantly from the pattern (Saunders et al., 2016, p. 
542). 
 

21 
 
(ii) 
Relationships 
 
A causal relationship suggests that one variable affects another or they are inversely 
proportional to each other (Eisenhardt, 1989, p. 544). An associative relationship indicates a 
connection between variables without implying causality (Creswell, 2014, p. 241). 
Contextual relationships consider the broader context in which the data was collected, this is 
because it calls for depth in its approach rather than just basics (Bryman, 2016, p. 340). 
Temporal relationships examine how variables change over time and it also considers that 
change is a constant factor that minimizes its permanence (Merriam, 2009, p. 214). 
(i) 
Final Conclusions:  
This is a conclusion that is definitive and based on comprehensive analysis or analysis 
that deals in intricate details or thorough investigation (Saunders et al., 2016, p. 545 
Data interpretation involves drawing conclusions from the data, based on the research 
question and objectives (Saunders et al., 2016, p. 543). 
2. Support Arguments: 
This provides evidence to support arguments and claims made in the dissertation. In other 
words, it is a basement for narratives or theories that have been established (Merriam, 2009, 
p. 212). Supporting arguments can enhance data interpretation in the following ways; 
(i) 
Contextualization: 
This provides context to the data, making it more meaningful and relevant. This can also 
suggest that it gives a broader picture of the data collected hence making it more value-
oriented (Creswell, 2014, p. 245)  
(ii) 
Validation:  
This provides a basis that strengthens the credibility of findings through logical reasoning and 
evidence. It is important to note that evidence is crucial in examining the credibility of a 
given narrative; therefore, validation assists in providing a background basis that enables the 
data interpretation process to flow successfully" (Bryman, 2016, p. 342). Inform decision-
making:  
 

22 
 
(iii) 
Clarification:  
This involves explaining complex data insights, making them more accessible and 
understandable (Merriam, 2009, p. 215). Clarification also involves breaking down details 
that may be hard to digest by the audiences. This move helps to make data more 
understandable and also eases the interpretation process. It is important to note that when 
data is broken down, it simplifies the identification of gaps and missing links which helps 
to inform the theory further. 
(iv) 
Generalizability:  
This considers how findings can be applied to wider contexts or populations (Saunders et al., 
2016, p. 545). It is based on the scope of the data collected, anticipating that the data should 
encompass a broader range to ensure that it is not limited to only a specific phenomenon.  
(v) 
Theoretical connections:  
The process of connecting data insights with established theories or frameworks serves to 
enrich our understanding (Eisenhardt, 1989, p. 548). It's noteworthy that data trends 
frequently mirror existing theories or narratives. For instance, the mass society theory, 
which suggests that individuals have a preference for belonging to larger societal groups, 
is often utilized to analyze various behavioral patterns, particularly in times of change. 
3. Inform-decision making 
The process of informing decision-making through data interpretation is essential as it allows 
stakeholders to make well-informed decisions based on valuable insights derived from data 
analysis. This approach not only guides decision-making but also plays a significant role in 
shaping theories and practices, as highlighted by Eisenhardt (1989, p. 548). Here’s how 
informing decision-making helps in data interpretation; 
(i) 
Identifying key findings:  
Data interpretation is an essential process in research as it involves analyzing and making 
sense of data to uncover valuable insights. These insights are crucial for informing 
decision-making processes. According to Creswell (2014, p. 245), data interpretation aids 
in the identification of critical insights that play a pivotal role in projecting key issues. 
These insights contribute to a detailed narrative that informs the research study findings. 

23 
 
Key findings extracted from data interpretation form a critical component of the overall 
conclusions drawn from the research study. 
(ii) 
Evaluating options:  
Interpreted data enables stakeholders to evaluate different options and choose the best 
course of action (Bryman, 2016, p. 342). These help the research findings to possess the 
most relevant arguments which helps in providing a comprehensively concluded report 
that informs the research study accordingly. Evaluating options helps to provide basis to 
select the most vital tips within the data so as to inform the research study. 
4. Identify limitations:  
Data interpretation should also consider the limitations of the study, including 
potential biases and errors (Creswell, 2014, p. 248). This argues that potential biases 
and errors may appear in the provisional findings therefore identifying those 
limitations assists in filtering or verifying unwanted data traits within the findings. 
The following are the different ways through which limitations are identified within 
the data; 
(i) 
Exposing assumptions:  
Data interpretation reveals underlying assumptions made during data collection or 
analysis (Bryman, 2016, p. 343). Bryman argues that while collecting data, it is 
possible for a researcher to make certain assumptions or assertions in a bid to gather 
data according to their narrative. These assumptions may sometimes have elements of 
propaganda or bias whose identification is vital during the data interpretation process. 
It is important to analyze data that is free from assumptions but genuine facts gathered 
from the field. 
(ii) 
Highlighting gaps:  
Interpreting data identifies gaps in data coverage, sampling, or instrumentation 
(Merriam, 2009, p. 217). When data is interpreted, gaps within the content gathered, 
and methods used can be identified, these gaps help to expose unwanted loopholes 
within the data structure which helps to minimize irregularities within the findings. It 
is important to note that existing gaps within the research study provide ground for 
conducting further research studies. 

24 
 
(iii) 
Detecting errors:  
 Data interpretation helps detect errors in data entry, coding, or analysis (Saunders et 
al., 2016, p. 547). Deleting errors helps to reduce or do away with unwanted traits 
within the data. This also helps to provide clean data for coding or analysis, having 
clean data without errors is important in analysis and conclusion as it provides ground 
for informative and relevant conclusions. 
(iv) 
Uncovering inconsistencies:  
Interpreting data involves a detailed examination of patterns, trends, and relationships 
within the dataset (Eisenhardt, 1989, p. 549). This meticulous process enables the 
identification of inconsistencies or irregularities before the commencement of data 
analysis. Uncovering these discrepancies within the data structure allows for 
corrective action to be taken, ensuring that the subsequent analysis is based on reliable 
and precise data, thereby minimizing the risk of drawing incorrect conclusions. 
(v) 
Assessing reliability and validity: 
 When interpreting data, it's important to consider the broader context in which the 
study was conducted, as mentioned by Bryman in 2016 (p. 342). Using theoretical 
frameworks to guide the analysis, as suggested by Eisenhardt in 1989 (p. 545), can 
enhance data interpretation. Additionally, researchers should explore alternative 
explanations for their findings during data interpretation, as emphasized by Merriam 
in 2009 (p. 215). It's also crucial to document the process of data interpretation to 
ensure transparency and replication of the results. 
5. Contextualize findings:  
Contextual findings play a crucial role in data interpretation by providing a deeper 
understanding of the research phenomenon. Contextualization involves considering 
the social, cultural, historical, and environmental factors that influence the data 
(Creswell, 2014, p. 245). Interpreting data requires considering the broader context in 
which the study was conducted (Bryman, 2016, p. 342). Contextual findings help in 
data interpretation through the following ways; 
Identify patterns and relationships that may not be immediately apparent (Bryman, 
2016, p. 342). It develops a more nuanced understanding of the data, reducing the risk 

25 
 
of misinterpretation (Merriam, 2009, p. 215). It also enhances the validity and 
reliability of findings by considering alternative explanations (Saunders et al., 2016, 
p. 545). It also increases the generalizability of findings by understanding how 
contextual factors influence the phenomenon (Eisenhardt, 1989, p. 548). Additionally, 
identify biases and assumptions that may have influenced data collection or analysis 
(Creswell, 2014, p. 246). It develops more effective interventions or solutions by 
understanding the contextual factors that influence the phenomenon (Bryman, 2016, 
p. 343) 
6. Use theoretical frameworks: 
A theoretical framework plays a crucial role in data interpretation by providing a 
conceptual lens through which to examine and understand the data (Creswell, 2014, p. 
245). It enables researchers to:  
Identify patterns and relationships in the data that align with or challenge existing 
theories (Bryman, 2016, p. 342). It develops a deeper understanding of the research 
phenomenon by situating it within a broader theoretical context (Merriam, 2009, p. 
215). It enhances the validity and reliability of findings by ensuring that they are 
grounded in established theoretical concepts (Saunders et al., 2016, p. 545). Increase 
the generalizability of findings by demonstrating how they contribute to or challenge 
existing theoretical knowledge (Eisenhardt, 1989, p. 548). Data interpretation can be 
enhanced by using theoretical frameworks to guide the analysis (Eisenhardt, 1989, p. 
545). It can develop a clear research question and objectives that are aligned with the 
theoretical framework (Creswell, 2014, p. 246). It is used to select appropriate data 
collection and analysis methods that are consistent with the theoretical framework 
(Bryman, 2016, p. 343). They are also used to identify potential biases and 
assumptions that may have influenced data collection or analysis (Merriam, 2009, p. 
217).  
Conclusively, a theoretical framework is essential for data interpretation as it provides 
a conceptual structure for understanding the data and situating it within a broader 
theoretical context. By using a theoretical framework, researchers can develop more 
accurate, valid, and reliable findings that contribute to the advancement of knowledge 
in their field

Data Description 
The data description part of a dissertation provides an overview of the data used in the 
study, including its source, collection methods, and characteristics. 
(i) 
Data source:  
Description of where the data came from, including any relevant details about the 
population or sample. 
The data for this research dissertation originated from digital journalism practitioners 
including students and staff from Uganda Christian University which is the case study 
area. As the research aims to assess the impact of the Computer Misuse Amendment Act 
(2022) on the practice of digital journalism, many scholars from the school of journalism, 
media, and communication have already felt the impacts exerted by the provisions of the 
Computer Misuse Amendment Act (2022) including social media abuse, access to 
unauthorized information, access to unsolicited information and malicious information 
among other key provisions that limit Digital Journalism practices  
(ii) 
Data collection methods:  
This provides explanation of how the data was collected, including any instruments, 
tools, or procedures used. For this research, data was collected using a questionnaire 
method and sent to about 10 participants with a 60% response rate. This questionnaire 
method was comprised of three key research questions:  
1. What are the loopholes within the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act), 2022 that are 
liable to exploitation by narrow interest parties?  
2. How can these loopholes hinder the advancement of Digital journalism practices?  
3. How can these loopholes be bridged? These questions were packaged in the form of an 
online survey which was then sent to the participants through email and WhatsApp.

Data characteristics:  
This is the description of the data's key features, such as level of measurement, data type, 
sample size, and population size. 

27 
 
The data type is Qualitative since it comprises of in-depth discussions or responses from 
the participants. The data was collected from a sample space of 10 participants with a 
60% response rate. It is also important to note that Qualitative data seeks to understand 
the meaning and context of the data, rather than just its numerical value. Qualitative data 
is often subjective and open to interpretation, requiring the researcher to analyze and 
make sense of the data. The data was cleaned and checked for outliers. Conclusively, the 
data description section of a research study provides essential information about the data 
used to investigate the research question or hypothesis. By including details about the 
data source, collection methods, characteristics, quality, and limitations, researchers can 
ensure transparency, replicability, and validity of their findings. 
Results 
The following were the results from the research conducted to assess the impact of the 
Computer Misuse Amendment Act (2022) on the practice of Digital Journalism a case 
study of Uganda Christian University. The responses from the research participants have 
been set as pseudonyms A, B, C, D, E, and F, this is because they requested privacy with 
their names 
1. What are the loopholes within the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act) 2022 that are liable to 
exploitation by narrow interest parties? 
             Respondent A - If enforcement of the law is subject to discretion or influenced by political or other  
            considerations, narrow-interest parties may attempt to use their connections or influence to avoid prosecution 
             or receive preferential treatment. 
           Respondent B - Some of the provisions for the act, for example, provision 2, talk about regulating the 
            sharing and access to malicious information in favor of these parties in such a way that they hope to use 
            this to get away with their dirty acts because this limits the gatekeepers, that is, journalists, from playing 
            their watchdog roles.  
            Respondent C - Hate speech 
          Respondent D - It threatens freedom of expression online with all rights of receive and impart and it  

28 
 
           targets critics of the government and this will end up preventing people from speaking their minds thus 
           curtailing people's rights. Additionally, this law claims to prohibit hate speech yet their other laws that control  
             hate speech and defamation in this country  
           Respondent E – It is simply a weak law 
 
         Respondent F - It targets the youth in Uganda who depend on social media. Infact social media is a  
         tool for people to express themselves in third world countries because Leaders from those countries put  
         strict laws that are in there favour. To add on, you can't tell me that you want to prohibit hate speech,  
          when am I to ask what hate speech is, and how is it measured? This can be influenced by the  
         Government to prohibit freedom of expression because may fail to say anything because they 
          might be fear of the Act 
 
 
2. How can these loopholes hinder the advancement of digital journalism practices? 
          Respondent A - selective enforcement of provisions may create an effect on freedom of expression 
         among journalists. Fear of violating the law or facing consequences could lead to self-censorship, causing 
         journalists to refrain from covering certain topics or expressing controversial opinions. Narrow interest  
         parties may exploit loopholes to hinder investigative journalism efforts by limiting access to information  
        or intimidating journalists who seek to uncover  wrongdoing.  
      Respondent B - These loopholes have removed the digital freedom journalism had,  
       which affects the practice. Journalists will start sugarcoating things instead of coming 
       out as journalists to be the voices of the people. 
       Respondent C - Digital journalism plays a crucial role in the modern media landscape allowing  
           for more timely, interactive, and multimedia reporting. Legal frameworks must be involved to 
          support and enable these practices while also addressing legitimate concerns around cyber security, privacy,  
          and the spread of misinformation. 

29 
 
             Respondent D - The above loopholes will lead to curtailing of freedom of expression and once this is done, 
           digital journalism practices will be no more also people are prevented from speaking their minds because  
            you never know what will be taken as hate speech or not thus hindering digital journalism  
           Respondent E - In the case of copyright, the victim has no protection from the act 
 
 
                Respondent F - Content creation especially in the political environment will be reduced because no 
              one will be hosted and talk freely about an issue because they fear capturing the theme of hate speech.  
             Freedom for Journalists will be reduced in the country because some journalists resorted to digital journalism 
              and put their feelings that they serve the common man, now when they talk about issues like corruption in  
                 Parliament, someone can take them to court for not respecting the Act 
           3. How can these loopholes be bridged? 
 
 
         Respondent A - Allocate sufficient resources to enforcement agencies responsible for implementing the Act, 
          including training for law enforcement personnel on identifying and prosecuting violations related to digital  
            journalism practices. Ensure judicial independence and impartiality in interpreting and applying the law. 
         Respondent B - As much as the government wants to regulate computer misuse, the loopholes should be  
         looked into and regulated. The leaders should be closely monitored so that they are not the ones misusing  
          this act for personal gain. 
       Respondent C - Ongoing review and amendment process; laws and regulations need to be regularly reviewed and 
          updated to ensure they remain fit- for purpose and as technology and societal needs evolve.  
         This requires an open collaborative process involving lawmakers, legal experts, industry, representatives, civil  
          society groups, and other affected stakeholders.  
          Respondent D - The Government should work together with all stakeholders like Journalists, lawyers, etc 
       to make a better version of the law that doesn't limit anyone's freedoms  

30 
 
           Respondent E - Implement laws 
          Respondent F - The Government should revise this law again and should consult stakeholders in the industry 
         like lawyers, journalists, the Church etc  
 
 
The following are the key findings from the results of the research study on the impact 
of the Computer Misuse Amendment Act (2022) on Digital Journalism practices. The 
first research question presented the following key findings. 
1. What are the loopholes within the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act) 2022 that 
are liable to exploitation by narrow interest parties? 
Respondent B - Some of the provisions for the act, for example, provision 2, talk about

CHAPTER FIVE 
DISCUSSION OF RESULTS 
5.0 Interpretation of Results 
This section is where results are discussed in relationship with the research questions, 
literature review and theoretical framework to provide a clear context of the findings of the 
research study; 
5.1 Research Questions Vs Findings 
The following were the research questions used in the research study above in relation to 
their key findings; 
1. What are the loopholes within the Computer Misuse Amendment Act 2022 that are 
liable to exploitation by narrow interest parties? 
Respondent B – Argues that the provision of the law that talks about regulating the sharing 
and access to malicious information which is in favour of these parties in such a way that 
they hope to use this to get away with their dirty acts because this limits the gatekeepers that 
is, journalists from playing their watchdog roles. 
This respondent argued that some of the provisions of the Computer Misuse Amendment Act 
2022 including the prohibition of access and sharing of malicious information can act as a 
vantage point for narrow interest parties, who may get away with the law simply because it 
shields Digital journalists from accessing those malicious activities or it renders it unlawful 
for Digital journalists to access such information. This therefore implies that the provision of 
the Computer Misuse Amendment Act (2022) is a loophole that is liable for exploitation by 
narrow interest parties. 
Respondent D: It threatens freedom of expression online with all rights to receive and 
impart, and it targets critics of the government hence this will end up preventing people from 
speaking their minds thus curtailing people’s rights. Additionally, this law claims to prohibit 
hate speech yet there are other laws that control hate speech and defamation in this country. 
 

34 
 
This respondent argued that the Computer Misuse Amendment Act (2022) limits freedom of 
expression online by Digital Journalists especially when targeted to government which will 
limit expression. This also implies that independent digital media houses such as Daily 
Monitor, who play an important role in exposing fraud, corruption and abuse of office by 
government officials might limited because the law in one way or the other render them as 
haters. Therefore, the respondent argues that the Computer Misuse Amendment Act (2022) 
itself is a loophole that is liable for exploitation by these narrow interest parties. 
Respondent F – It targets the youth in Uganda, who depend on social media. Infact social 
media is a tool for people to express themselves in third world countries because leaders from 
those countries put strict laws that are in their favour. To add on, you can’t tell me that you 
want to prohibit hate speech, when am to ask what hate speech is and how is it measured? 
This can be influenced by the Government to prohibit freedom of expression because people 
might fail to say anything because they might be in fear of the Computer Misuse Amendment 
Act (2022) 
This respondent argues that laws such as the Computer Misuse Amendment Act (2022) are 
used by leaders in third world countries in their favour for example limiting the youth from 
expressing themselves using social media. They also argued that there is no specific 
measurement for hate speech which may render narrow interest parties to use this law in their 
favour. He demonstrates that the provision of the law to prohibit hate speech is a loophole 
which liable for exploitation by narrow interest parties. 
2. How can these loopholes hinder the advancement of digital Journalism practices? 
Respondent A – The Selective enforcement of the provisions may create an effect on 
freedom of expression among journalists. Fear of violating the law or facing 
consequences could lead to self-censorship, causing Digital journalists to refrain from 
covering certain topics or expressing controversial opinions. Narrow interest parties 
may exploit loopholes to hinder investigative journalism efforts by limiting access to 
information or intimidating journalists, who seek to uncover wrongdoings. 
The respondent argues that selective enforcement of the provisions which affects freedom of 
expression among journalists can hinder the advancement of digital journalism practices 
because they will fear violating the law or facing consequences surrounding the law, this is 
because of self-censorship through refraining from covering certain topics or expressing 

35 
 
controversial opinions. The respondent further argued that investigative journalism practices 
in the digital era might be hindered due to the provisions that limit access to information 
when trying to uncover wrongdoings 
Respondent B – These loopholes have removed the digital freedom journalism had which 
affects the practice. Journalists will start sugarcoating things instead of coming out with as a 
journalist to be the voice of the people. 
This respondent argues that the loopholes within the Computer Misuse Amendment Act 
(2022) have removed the digital freedom journalism had and he adds that this will hinder the 
advancement of Digital Journalism since these Journalists will start sugarcoating facts instead 
of presenting them the way they are as their obligation to expose the truth. 
Respondent D – The above loopholes will lead to curtailing of freedom of expression and 
once this is done, digital journalism practices will be no more. Also, people are prevented 
from speaking their minds because you never know what will be taken as hate speech or not 
thus hindering digital journalism practices. 
This respondent argues that the loopholes within the Computer Misuse Amendment Act 
(2022) will hinder the advancement of Digital Journalism practices through its attempt to 
curtail freedom of expression. In addition, Digital Journalists will be prevented from speaking 
their minds through writing opinion articles because they aren’t sure of what will be taken as 
hate speech. 
Respondent F – Content creation especially in the political environment will be reduced 
because no one will be hosted and talk freely about an issue because they fear capturing the 
them for hate speech. Freedom for journalists will be reduced in the country because some 
journalists resorted to digital journalism and put their feelings that they serve the common 
man, now when they talk about issues like corruption in parliament, someone can take them 
to court for not respecting the Computer Misuse Amendment Act (2022). 
This respondent argued that the loopholes will hinder the advancement of Digital Journalism 
practices by reducing content creation in the political environment for example people will 
fear to be hosted and talk freely about issues of national concern like corruption, fraud and 
abuse of public offices due to fear that hate speech will catch up with them. He also added 

36 
 
that the loopholes within the Computer Misuse Amendment Act (2022) will hinder 
advancement of Digital Journalism since freedom for journalists will be reduced  
3. How can these loopholes be bridged? 
Respondent B – As much as the government wants to implement the Computer 
Misuse Amendment Act (2022), the loopholes should be looked into and regulated. 
The leaders should be closely monitored so that they are not the ones misusing this 
Act for personal gains 
The respondent suggests that the loopholes within the Computer Misuse Amendment Act 
(2022) can be bridged through looking into the law and regulating it to minimize leaders from 
misusing the Act for their personal gains. 
Respondent C – Ongoing review and Amendment process; laws and regulations need to be 
regularly reviewed and updated to ensure they remain fit-for-purpose and as technology and 
societal needs evolve. This requires an open collaborative process involving lawmakers, legal 
experts, industry, representatives, civil society groups, and other affected stakeholders. 
This respondent explains that the loopholes within the Computer Misuse Amendment Act 
(2022) can be bridged through undertaking review and amendment processes indicating that 
laws and regulations need to be regularly reviewed and updated to ensure they remain fit-for-
purpose as technology and societal needs evolve. They further suggested that engaging 
collaborative processes involving lawmakers, legal experts, industry, representatives, civil 
society groups, and other affected stakeholders is key in a bid to bridge the loopholes within 
the Computer Misuse Amendment Act (2022) 
Respondent D – The government should work together with all stakeholders like journalists, 
lawyers etc to make a better version of the law that does not limit anyone’s freedoms.  
This respondent suggested that in a bid to bridge loopholes within the Computer Misuse 
Amendment Act (2022), the government should work together with all stakeholders like 
journalists, lawyers to make a better version of the law that does not limit anyone’s freedoms. 
Respondent F – The government should revise this law again and should consult 
stakeholders in the industry like lawyers, journalists and the church 
 

37 
 
This respondent also suggested that in an attempt to bridge the loopholes, government should 
revise this law again and should consult stake holders in the industry like lawyers, journalists 
and the church 
5.2 Findings Vs Literature Review 
The following sub-section will discuss the relationship between the Findings of this research 
and the Literature review 
As previously discussed in the Literature review many scholars agree that the Computer 
Misuse Amendment Act (2022) was proposed, enacted, and signed into law with the sole aim 
of restricting Digital journalism practices since they scrutinize government bodies, demand 
accountability, and perform the public watchdog role using platforms like Twitter(X), 
YouTube, and Instagram among others according to my research findings based on the 
question. In addition, the initial target of the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act) was to 
primarily litigate and intimidate free online sharing of information by Digital Journalists from 
accessing and disseminating unauthorized information of public interest for example 
corruption scandals, fraud, bribery, embezzlement of public funds and incompetence among 
government officials “How can these loopholes hinder the advancement of Digital Journalism 
practices?” the respondents presented similar results as follows; 
Respondent A  
This respondent argued that selective enforcement of the provisions of the Computer Misuse 
Amendment Act (2022) might create an effect on freedom of expression among Journalists. 
The respondent further explained that fear of violating the law or facing consequences could 
lead to self-censorship, causing journalists to refrain from covering certain topics or 
expressing controversial opinions. Since the law restricts Digital Journalism practices, the 
respondent asserted that narrow interest parties may exploit loopholes to hinder investigative 
journalism efforts since it limits access to information or intimidates journalists who seek to 
uncover wrongdoings. 
Respondent B 
This particular respondent asserts that the loopholes within the Computer Misuse 
Amendment Act (2022) have removed the digital freedom journalism had which affects the 
practice, since they have been restricted, journalists will start sugarcoating things instead of 
coming out as the voice to the voiceless. 

38 
 
Respondent D 
This respondent discussed that the loopholes within the Computer Misuse Amendment ACT 
(2022) will lead to curtailing of freedom of expression and once this is done, digital 
journalism practices will be no more since people are prevented from speaking their minds 
because you never know what will be taken as hate speech or not thus hindering digital 
journalism. 
Respondent F  
Respondent F explained that content creation especially in the political environment will be 
reduced because no one will be hosted and they talk freely about issues because they fear 
being captured because of hate speech. They further revealed that freedom for journalists will 
be reduced in the country because some journalists will not discuss issues like corruption due 
to fear of being taken to court for not respecting the Act. 
As earlier discussed in the Literature review upon examining online restrictions through laws 
like the Computer Misuse Amendment Act (2022), different scholars, authors, and schools of 
thought agree that these policies undermine international human rights standards; They 
further state that these policies lack a framework of validity, legitimateness, rightness, and 
necessity. Through research question “What are the loopholes within the Computer Misuse 
Amendment Act (2022) that are liable to exploitation by narrow interest parties? The 
following findings relate to the Literature review; 
Respondent F 
This respondent argued that the Computer Misuse Amendment Act (2022) targets the youth 
in Uganda who depend on social media. They further added that social media is a tool for 
people to express themselves in third world countries where leaders from those countries put 
strict laws that are in their favor. In addition, respondent F “narrates that you can’t tell me 
that you want to prohibit hate speech when they are to ask what hate speech is and how it is 
measured?”. They further added that the Computer Misuse Amendment Act (2022) can be 
influenced by the government to prohibit freedom of expression because people may fail to 
say anything because they might be in fear of the Act. 
 
 

39 
 
Respondent B 
This respondent asserted that the provision of the law that talks about regulating the sharing 
and access to malicious information is in favor of these interest parties who may use this to 
get away with their dirty acts because the Computer Misuse Amendment Act (2022) limits 
the gatekeepers who are digital journalists from playing their watchdog roles. 
Respondent D 
This respondent asserts that the Computer Misuse Amendment Act threatens freedom of 
expression online with all rights to receive and impart. It targets critics of the government and 
this will end up preventing people from speaking their minds thus curtailing people’s rights. 
Additionally, this law claims to prohibit hate speech yet there are other laws that control hate 
speech and defamation in this country. 
5.3 Theoretical Framework Vs Findings 
This sub-section addresses the relationship between the theoretical framework and the 
findings of the research study 
As previously discussed in the theoretical framework, Andrew Feeberg (2008) stated that the 
dynamics of the critical theory in the communication technological era have changed, this is 
because it provides a primary preposition to societal issues of public interest. In addition, it 
further indicates that the internet provides innovational structures that collectively unify 
respective audiences. Therefore, the research findings of this study through the research 
question “How can the loopholes in the Computer Misuse Amendment Act (2022) be 
bridged?” draws relationship with some of the responses from the participants as seen below; 
Respondent C 
The ongoing review and Amendment process; rules and regulations need to be regularly 
reviewed and updated to ensure they remain fit and as technology and societal needs evolve. 
This requires an open collaborative process involving lawmakers, legal experts, industry, 
representatives, civil society groups and other affected stakeholders. 
Respondent D 
The government should work together with all the stakeholders like Journalists, Lawyers etc 
to make a better version of the law that doesn’t limit anyone’s freedoms. 

40 
 
Respondent F 
The government should revise this law again and should consult stakeholders in the industry 
like lawyers, journalists, and the church. 
As previously discussed in the theoretical framework, this study also hints at the authoritarian 
theory of media which states that man is weak insinuating that he is overshadowed by the 
powers and authority of the state and governments. In addition, it highlights that the media is 
meant to serve the functionalities and interests of the state which includes propaganda 
manifestations and brutalization of democratic processes and participation such as elections 
in a bid to favor them (Anne, 2019). However, if this narrative is related to the findings 
through the research question “How can the loopholes within the Computer Misuse 
Amendment Act (2022) hinder the advancement of Digital Journalism practices?” the 
following responses by participants render the Computer Misuse Amendment Act (2022) 
authoritative and meant to serve the functionalities and interests of the state as seen below; 
Respondent B 
These loopholes have removed the digital freedom journalism had which affects the practice. 
Journalists will start sugarcoating things instead of coming out as journalists to be the voices 
of the people. 
Respondent D 
The loopholes within the Computer Misuse Amendment Act (2022) will lead to curtailing of 
freedom of expression and once this is done, digital journalism practices will be no more also 
people are prevented from speaking their minds because you never know what will be taken 
as hate speech or not thus hindering digital journalism 
Respondent F 
Content Creation especially in the political environment will be reduced because no one will 
be hosted and talk freely about an issue because they will fear being captured for hate speech. 
Freedom for journalists will be reduced in the country because some digital journalism 
practitioners who put their feelings that they serve the common man will abscond from 
talking about issues like corruption in parliament since someone can take them to court for 
not respecting the provisions of the Act.

5.3 Ethical Considerations 
The findings of the research study above are represented by the pseudonyms A, B, C, D, E, 
and F to protect their identity as all the subjects requested to be anonymous based on the 
subject matter of the study which is assessing the impact of the Computer Misuse 
(Amendment Act) 2022 on digital journalism practices. Additionally, the research findings of 
the study are truthfully presented as retrieved from the survey tool used to carry out the study. 
It is important to note that this research survey was not ambushed onto the participants but 
rather their consent was sought first before any questions were shared with them. Therefore, 
the participants responded at their will, freedom, and laxity. 
5.4 Limitations of Findings 
The findings of this study were limited by a lack of responses from some of the sampled 
participants. It is important to note the responses were 60% which narrowed the scope of the 
findings. In addition, the questionnaire method of research was envisioned to allow the 
participants to express themselves freely while responding to the questions at their own pace 
but it turned out that some participants forgot or lost interest in the cause hence this limited 
our scope of findings. It should also be noted that some participants did not provide detailed 
explanations to the questions despite it being open-ended as qualitative research demands. 
This therefore limited our analysis of their responses since we could not understand which 
school of thought inspired their responses and hence could not make assumptions on their 
behalf. 
5.5 Unexpected results 
The following are some of the unexpected results registered from the research study 
conducted to assess the impact of the Computer Misuse Amendment Act (2022) on Digital 
Journalism practices: A Case study of Uganda Christian University. Three research questions 
were formulated and sent inform of a questionnaire survey. The questions included; 
1) What are the loopholes within the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act) 2022 that are 
liable to exploitation by narrow interest parties? 
2) How can these loopholes hinder the advancement of digital journalism practices? 
3) How can these loopholes be bridged? 
The following were some unexpected results from the research questions as seen below;
