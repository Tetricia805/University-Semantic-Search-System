CHAPTER ONE:
1.0.Introduction
The combination of drip irrigation with drip bottles is used to produce tomatoes. This
chapter also consists of the background, problem statement, study objective, questions
that the study will endeavor to answer, scope of the study, together with the conceptual
framework of the study. This study set out to explore the efficacy and the efficacy of
drip irrigation systems incorporating drip bottles to produce tomatoes. With increasing
alarm at the scarcity of water and the imperative of sustainable agriculture, the study
establishes the manner in which the new system of irrigation will increase agricultural
production with minimal usage of water.
2.0.Background of the study
Drip irrigation has attracted great international attention as a highly efficient means of
water application in agriculture, especially against the backdrop of water scarcity
complications. Fadul et al. (2018) confirm that the type of irrigation allows the delivery
of water directly at the plant root zones, thus reducing evaporation- and runoff-
associated losses. It has been perceived as a sustainable option for increasing
agricultural production against the background of climate change and restricted water
availability (Kadam et al., 2019). Economically viable small-scale drip irrigation systems,
such as the utilization of drip bottles, have more recently been recommended as
sustainable options against the background of economically challenged territories,
which constitute the predominant area of discerning farmers. FAO (2020) calls attention
to the need to popularize low-cost irrigation technologies to enhance food security,
especially against the background of the economically challenged countries of the
world.
The study conducted by Singh et al. (2021) shows that the adoption of drip irrigation,
particularly of vegetables such as tomato, enhances the use of water more efficiently
and reduces the pressure on labor and energy compared to traditional methods. It is
one of the observations that illustrates the global trend of adopting low-cost, highly

2
effective agricultural technologies that aim at sustainable utilization of agricultural
practices.
In the case of Africa, one of the main challenges facing agricultural productivity is the
limited accessibility of water resources, which has spurred the wide-scale adoption of
drip irrigation systems as one of the effective solutions to manage the problem. As
cited by Mekonnen et al. (2020), many smallholder farmers throughout sub-Saharan
Africa have been turning more to drip irrigation technologies to improve the utilization
of water and boost crop production, especially where the regions will be hit the hardest
by the lack of rainfall.
The high cost of traditional drip irrigation systems has led to the search for more
affordable solutions like drip bottles. The use of drip bottles as an irrigation resource,
especially on the smaller scale of vegetable production—such as that of tomato
farming—has been identified as an effective, sustainable practice in many countries of
Africa, like Tanzania, Ethiopia, and Kenya. A study by Mugambi et al. (2021) has it that
Kenyan smallholder farmers have enjoyed increased tomato production due to more
effective water usage after the use of drip bottle irrigation. It makes one have less
dependence on the high-cost infrastructure and shows versatility when it comes to
various conditions on the farm. The use of affordable technologies is one needed
remedy that Africa has to adopt if it has to boost farm productivity amidst the ever-
growing climate-related issues.
In Uganda, the agricultural sector is still one of the contributors to the national economy
due to the fact that tomatoes are one of the commonly produced vegetables. However,
various farmers have been experiencing challenges related to access to water
resources, as well as the efficacy of the irrigation systems during dry periods. As
uncovered by Ahimbisibwe et al. (2022), the utilization of drip irrigation technologies
has evolved since the previous years. However, the high costs of the traditional drip
systems have often disqualified the system as an option of use by smallholder
producers. As such, the need to explore cheap options such as the use of drip bottles
has become necessary of late. Current research by Kyomugisha et al. (2023) has shown

3
that the utilization of drip bottle irrigation has been gaining popularity in Uganda,
particularly in places such Wakiso and Mukono, where various farmers have been
embracing the practice on a small scale to obtain vegetable produce such as tomatoes.
The practice has great promise in the acceleration of more effective utilization of water
and selection of crops within the more impoverished members of the farming
community. Located on the southwestern flank of the country, the Cabale District has
undulating relief that has high farming potential. Tomatoes have become the primary
source of livelihood for various families within the area of interest. However,
intermittent poor rainfall and water scarcity have been harmful to the production of
agriculture for the last few years. As such, the need to have high-grade methods of
water utilization has been driving the use of drip bottle irrigation as an affordable and
effective practice by small-scale farmers.
1.1
Type of Irrigation (Drip Irrigation)
Drip irrigation is a water-saving practice of watering in which the water is delivered
directly to the plant root zone via slow and minimal application. It greatly reduces water
loss, suppresses the formation of runoff on the surface, and ensures that the plants
have a stable level of moisture. In the case of the use of "drip bottles," it is a low-cost
and simplified improvement of the standard drip irrigation by placing the bottles near
the plant roots, thereby achieving slow release of the water. It is particularly valuable
where one has a small farm enterprise or where the resources to access high-end
irrigation technologies are extremely constrained.
Drip bottles are made of specially crafted plastic containers that allow the progressive
release of water on the soil via a small opening or a plastic tube. This technological
development presents a cheap and easy-to-use means of implementing drip irrigation
systems.
The "drip bottles" will be the independent variables of the current study. Researchers will
manipulate the number, size, or length of water released by the drip bottles as the
purpose to investigate the effects these modifications will have on tomato plant
development. With the drip bottles, the researchers will replicate the scientific process
of watering plants. The independent variable will enable the study to test the various

4
watering configurations—such as the number of drip bottles utilized or the water flow
rate—having various effects on the dependent variable, such as plant development and
fruit production.
The vertical height of the tomato plant, i.e., plant height, is the length of the plant from
bottom to top and can be expressed in centimeters or inches. During our experiment,
the dependent variable reflects the overall state of development and vitality of the
plants. Plant height can be influenced by the efficacy of the drip irrigation system that
has been employed. This experiment will determine the influence of the modifications
made on the plant height of the tomato plants on the structure of the drip bottle
arrangement that has been labeled as the independent variable. This experiment will
illustrate the response of the plants to modifications made to the water supply and
nutrient availability.
Leaf number is the number of leaves on the tomato plant and is an indication of plant
health plus the crop. We established that leaf number has a connection with the plant's
health, potential for photosynthesis, and vigor. In this lab, the plants will have their leaf
number counted as part of how growth and development are affected by the different
watering methods, for instance, by the drip bottle. Larger numbers of leaves are typically
an indication of a healthier plant with higher absorption of nutrients.
Fruit growth examines the physical properties of the tomatoes, such as shape, size, and
weight. These are crucial for determining the quality of the tomato crop. With the fruit in
the experiment, the fruit will be measured for its size, shape, and weight as dependent
variables to determine how the different irrigation techniques, such as the use of drip
bottles, impact the quality and quantity of the fruit.
Soil type, nutrient content, and environmental conditions act as mediator variables.
These can have the ability to intervene between the independent variables (drip bottles)
and the dependent variables (e.g., plant height, number of leaves, and fruit formation).
Soil type is the grouping of soil according to the physical properties of the soil, including
texture and structure, as well as the soil's chemical properties, including soil pH and

5
nutrient status. Different soil types (e.g., sandy, loamy, and clay) will have different
effects on the effectiveness of water absorption and retention, and therefore plant
development. This study will take into account the influence of various soil textures on
the effectiveness of drip irrigation.
The type of soil, composition of nutrients, and the surroundings are mediational
variables. These variables have the potential to mediate the association between the
independent variables (drip bottles) and the dependent variables (e.g., the plant height,
number of leaves, and fruit development). Soil type is the characterization of soil using
its physical properties, for example, texture, structure, also its chemical properties, for
instance, the pH and nutrients. Different soil types (e.g., sandy, loamy, clay) will
influence how well water is absorbed and retained, affecting plant growth. The study will
account for how varying soil textures impact the effectiveness of drip irrigation.
Soil Nutrients. This refers to the essential elements and compounds that are present in
the soil and necessary for plant growth, including macronutrients (e.g., nitrogen,
phosphorus, potassium) and micronutrients (e.g., iron, zinc, boron).
The availability of nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in the soil will
influence plant development. The study will need to consider how nutrient levels interact
with the irrigation method.
Environmental Conditions. Environmental conditions refer to the external factors that
affect the growth and development of tomato plants, including temperature, humidity,
light, wind, and precipitation.
Temperature, humidity, rainfall, and light levels all play a role in plant growth and fruit
development. The study will need to consider how these factors will influence the
results, as external conditions can either complement or hinder the effects of drip
irrigation.

1.2. Problem statement
In Uganda, agriculture is the backbone of the economy, contributing 24% of the
country’s GDP (UBOS, 2022). However, over 90% of Ugandan farmers rely on rain-fed
agriculture, making them vulnerable to droughts and erratic rainfall patterns. Water

6
scarcity during the dry season leads to substantial losses in tomato production, one of
the country’s key horticultural crops. According to Ahimbisibwe et al. (2022), Ugandan
tomato farmers reported yield reductions of up to 40% due to inadequate water
management practices, highlighting the urgent need for more efficient irrigation
solutions. The primary problem is the inefficient use of water resources in tomato
cultivation, which leads to water wastage, poor crop yield, and environmental
degradation. Traditional irrigation methods often lead to uneven water distribution, soil
erosion, and a higher risk of diseases. Agriculture uses about 70% of global freshwater.
In some areas, water scarcity is a serious problem. Drip irrigation can cut water use by
30-50% compared to traditional methods. Many farmers are not aware of the benefits of
drip irrigation systems, especially simple techniques like drip bottles. A common lack of
technical knowledge on the proper configuration and maintenance of these systems
can result in suboptimal performance or entire system failure. High upfront investment
needed to support advanced drip irrigation systems may discourage smallholder
farmers, thus limiting their access to high-efficiency irrigation technologies. The
problem is rampant where water resources are scarce or where the area is facing
drought conditions, particularly in the developing world. Local agricultural practices may
also exacerbate the problem, especially where old-school methods of irrigation have
been the status quo. Addressing these has been the notable contribution of the study to
the improvement of irrigation practices in tomato production, achieving enhanced
resource utilization and greater agricultural productivity.
As a result, this study aimed to cover these gaps by investigating the use of drip bottle
irrigation, including investigating the effectiveness of the system over conventional
methods of irrigation and discussing its promise of sustainability and affordability as a
production mode of small-scale tomato production.

tomato yields, especially for smallholder farmers.
Given that agriculture accounts for a significant portion of global water consumption,
the study will demonstrate how drip irrigation can lead to more efficient water use.
For smallholder farmers with limited resources, the cost of traditional drip irrigation
systems is often prohibitive. This study will highlight the affordability and accessibility

8
of drip bottle irrigation as a low-cost alternative.
The findings from this study will be useful for policymakers, non-governmental
organizations (NGOs), and agricultural extension services in developing and promoting
affordable irrigation technologies.

1.2.6 1.9 Justifications of the study
Addressing water scarcity in agriculture, water scarcity is a critical issue globally,
particularly in regions where rain-fed agriculture is the norm. In many areas, erratic
rainfall and droughts pose significant threats to crop production, especially for water-
intensive crops like tomatoes. It is justified for this study to look into the use of drip
irrigation using drip bottles, for it provides an original yet inexpensive method for
efficiently managing water resources in tomato crops. Utilization of drip irrigation
systems facilitates watering of the crop with minimal water loss and a sure supply of
water. It addresses efficiently, to a considerable level, the main concerns that were

10
revolving around the utilization of the agricultural water resources.
Tomato is a valuable crop for most smallholders where they obtain the crop as a source
of both income and foodstuff.
However, poor irrigation methods often yield reduced outputs, particularly during dry
periods. This study analyzes the effectiveness of drip bottle irrigation as an ecofriendly
approach to increasing tomato yields. Yield increase is crucial towards food sufficiency
as well as the supply of stable income for the farmer, especially for regions like Kabale
District where agriculture remains the backbone of the economy.
Drip irrigation with these bottles can raise tomato production by directing water right to
the roots. This decreases evaporation and runoff. It conserves water, eases water
stress, and helps plants grow better, resulting in higher yields. By using recycled plastic
bottles, farmers can adopt an affordable and sustainable irrigation method.
In addition, drip irrigation enhances soil health, minimizes the use of chemicals, and
avoids pollution by using plastic bottles that would otherwise cause environmental
hazard. This method ensures water supply throughout, even in dry conditions, thus
preventing water scarcity and maintaining the supply of tomatoes. Through water
conservation and reduced costs, the use of bottles in drip irrigation may help the farmer
add value to the crops he grows while providing for the assured supply of food. With the
right design and maintenance, such a strategy will act as an effective and assured
means of enhancing tomato growing, especially for the small-scale growers who have
dry spells.

1.2.8 CHAPTER TWO:
1.2.9 LITERATURE REVIEW
1.2.10 2.1 Introduction
Drip irrigation is an effective agricultural technology for water conservation,
increasingly gathering steam among sustainable agricultural practitioners,
particularly where sources of water are limited. A distinct improvement within the
system is the use of drip bottles, which is a simple, cheap option for smallholder
farmers. This literature review considers the determinants of tomato producers'
choices of using drip irrigation, the challenges they encounter in the use of drip
bottles, and the profitability of the practice over the use of other established
forms of irrigation.
1.2.11
1.1 Factors Influencing the Adoption of Drip Irrigation Among
Tomato Farmers
The adoption of drip irrigation technology, for example, drip bottles, depends on the
established set of socio-economic, technical, and environmental conditions. Studies by
Kassie and others (2020) point out that the availability of information and knowledge on
the advantage of the use of drip irrigation when making the choice is crucial. Vegetable
growers also perceive the advantage of drip irrigation, such as the conservation of
water, as determinants of their decision. Furthermore, Okoro and others (2021) confirm
that the availability of credit facilities and government assistance would facilitate the
adoption of superior irrigation technologies, such as drip bottles, by making the start of
adoption easier.
Babalola et al. (2019) observed that insufficient resources and inadequate technical
skills prevent the utilization of superior irrigation technology, particularly by small
farmers who cannot easily access modern irrigation devices. This therefore means that
if more utilization of drip bottle irrigation will be experienced, it has to be affordable by

13
the farmer, user-friendly, and facilitated for the user.
Gebrehiwot and van der Veen (2019) state that cultural and social forces exert a great
influence on the utilization of drip irrigation technologies. In the majority of agricultural
communities, traditional irrigation systems are an integral part of the culture, and
resistance to change could suppress the acceptance of modern technologies, including
drip bottles. Moreover, the impact of social networks and the demonstration
effect—where the achievements showcased by farming peers inspire growers to adopt
new practices on seeing the achievements of their farming counterparts—plays an
imperative role in shaping attitudes concerning drip irrigation.
Recent studies have explored the politics of gender roles. Adebayo et al. (2021)
identified that women farmers often face more challenges than their men on issues of
accessing vital resources like credit, land, and training. Since women dominate tomato
production in many places, correcting these gender inequities is central to supporting
drip irrigation adoption.
Economic incentives like subsidies and price support can spur the diffusion of new
technologies
rapidly.
Njoroge
et
al.
(2018),
for
example,
cited
that
research
demonstrated that government initiatives that placed partial subsidies on drip irrigation
systems raised acceptance of the technology by smallholder tomato producers. Partial
subsidies render the system more financially viable to producers who otherwise cannot
avail it by making it cheaper upfront.
The knowledge dissemination channels play a vital role in enhancing the utilization of
technology. Extension services, the farmer field schools, and demonstration plots avail
experiential learning platforms. Chibwana et al. (2021) state that farmers who engage in
practical training on the utilization of drip irrigation become more confident in their
skills of installing and maintaining the systems. As a result, it increases the level of
adoption and the level of productivity.
The decisions of farmers on the adoption of drip irrigation also depend on how they

14
perceive risk. As per the submission of Ochieng et al. (2019), risk-avoiding farmers may
be deterred from investing in drip irrigation systems on the fear of crop failure or
breakdown of machinery. Supplying insurance against these risks and technical service
provision may reduce these fears and, therefore, boost the adoption of drip irrigation
technologies by farmers.
Third, the fact that it can be integrated with various sustainable farming practices
makes it more appealing. Research by Adeyemi and Oladele (2023) has established that
those who practice drip irrigation alongside organic fertilization and combined pest
control will be experiencing increased crop outputs as well as input reduction. This
holistic practice not only enhances tomato output, it also makes the producers adopt
their drip irrigation systems in the long run.
2.3 Challenges faced by farmers in implementing Drip Irrigation using drip bottles
Whilst drip irrigation using plastic bottles has many potential benefits, the practice is
also
not
without
challenges.
Palanisamy
et
al.
(2022)
found
the
agricultural
communities are challenged installing and maintaining drip technology, particularly
where technical expertise is lacking. Precise system design, such as where to space the
bottles apart by and how the tubing is properly installed, guarantees effectiveness.
Inaccurate installation may create water wastages or lead to sub-irrigation that may
negatively affect tomato crop yield.
Sharma and Singh (2021) identified that substandard water quality, encompassing
sediments and chemicals, has the potential to obstruct drip bottles and tubing. This
obstruction diminishes the operational efficiency of the system and escalates
maintenance expenditures. This phenomenon is particularly prevalent in rural regions
where the quality of water sources may be inadequate. Furthermore, the seasonal
characteristics of tomato cultivation can result in irregular application of drip irrigation
systems, consequently leading to instances of neglect and insufficient utilization of the
existing infrastructure.

15
The agricultural producers also frequently face difficulties when they make the
transition to drip irrigation compared to the age-old irrigation technologies, i.e., flood or
furrow irrigation. Sahu et al. (2018) stated that improper perception regarding the
technicalities involved for the drip systems often results in improper uses. Such
circumstances might discourage large-scale acceptance and restrict the advantages
contemplated through the system.
It is a major challenge for regularized use of drip irrigation systems. Kundu et al. (2020)
observe that repeated clogging of the emitters by algae or mineral deposits needs
frequent cleaning. This cleaning is perceived by most smallholder farmers as being
labour-intensive and time-wasting. If the system lacks appropriate maintenance, its
efficiency declines very fast. This results in losing enthusiasm for the use of drip bottle
irrigation.
Infrastructure conditions have an overwhelming impact on the use and performance of
drip irrigation. Studies by Tesfaye et al. (2019) found that variability in water supply, due
to a lack of pumping systems or an inconsistent supply of electricity, often interferes
with planned irrigation. Such variability may cause suboptimum watering regimes, which
negatively affect the growth and production of tomato crops, so farmers hesitate to rely
on drip irrigation systems alone.
Financial concerns extend beyond initial installation expenses to repeated purchases on
maintenance and replacement spares. Mburu et al. (2021) observe that the majority of
the smallholder growers lack access to the spare parts including drip emitters, tubing,
and connectors, which are unavailable locally. In some cases, this non-availability
pushes the growers back to the use of the aged irrigation technology when repairs are
delayed or the repair becomes too costly.
Technical knowledge deficiencies remain an identified major barrier. Chukwu et al.
(2019) clarify that after initial training for the farmers, the complex nature of system
fault identification and solving limits the long-term use. Many farmers also have limited

16
access to technical assistance after the training, thus an inability to improve system
efficacy or remedy faults in a timely manner.
It also renders drip irrigation management challenging due to environmental challenges.
In regions where soil erosion or high-intensity rain is prevalent, runoff results in the
displacement or damage of drip bottles or tubing, according to Karim et al. (2020). This
not only results in physical loss but also diminishes the distribution of water, making
irrigation less uniform and less effective.
The labour intensity involved in installing and maintaining drip irrigation systems also
offers numerous challenges. Unlike flood irrigation, which needs less regular monitoring,
drip irrigation systems need steady monitoring and adjustments. Mwangi and Owuor
(2022) believe that this additional labour demand often deters the farmer who has
access constraints relating to time or labour availability, especially during peak periods
of agriculture.
Resistance by social and cultural means may also impede implementation. Research by
Ndlovu et al. (2018) indicates that certain agricultural communities see drip irrigation as
technology for the better-off-farmer or the commercial farm, so the smallholder
hesitates to adopt. This misconception, combined with an absence of peers who
successfully employ the technology, denies broader acceptance. This type of variability
has the potential to result in over-irrigation—wasting water and energy—and resulting in
an under-irrigated stressed tomato crop with reduced yield potential.
1.3
2.4 Cost-effectiveness of drip bottle Irrigation compared to conventional
methods
The financial profitability of drip bottle irrigation for growing tomatoes is an important
factor for its use, especially among the small-scale growers. In comparison to the
traditional techniques, drip irrigation normally has better water economy with lower cost
on water as well as labor.
Adebayo et al. (2020) also showed that the water loss is drastically reduced by drip

17
irrigation compared to flood irrigation, something quite useful where water is scarce.
However, the startup cost of installing drip bottle systems, which is lower than that of
the high-cost drip systems, might be difficult on the farmer.
Kebede et al. (2019) noted that though drip bottle irrigation is economically beneficial in
the long term, considering less water used and less labor required, the initial costs
relating to the purchase of materials and establishment of the system may deter the
farmer, especially the one with limited finances.
However, on the other hand, Ravindra et al. (2021) believe that long-term advantages for
investment in drip bottle systems overcome the initial costs, whereby high outputs due
to the high-efficiency irrigation increase the initial costs. In addition, site variables such
as availability of water, wage rates, as well as the type of crops grown determine the
economic efficacy of the systems. For instance, tomato crops, due to their high
sensitivity to water stress, highly benefit from the stable moisture delivered by drip
bottle systems, hence delivering better outputs and quality.
The economic viability of drip bottle irrigation often relies on its ability to optimize
resource use. Mwangi et al. (2020) believe that the precise water distribution by drip
bottle systems minimizes overwater use, hence delivering savings on water purchase
as well as pumping power. On the contrary, the typical flood or furrow irrigation often
has high water loss by evaporation as well as runoff, hence increasing the total cost of
production.
Reduced labour costs are also among the major economic advantages of drip bottle
irrigation. Singh et al. (2019) indicated that drip irrigation systems partly automate the
application of water, hence saving the farmer's time on manual irrigation. This saved
labour is directed to additional activities on the farm, thereby enhancing the total
productivity on the farm, besides also reducing the dependence on the use of costly
hired labour among the smallholder tomato producers.

18
In spite of the obvious savings on operation, the startup price of drip bottle kits still
remains
an
issue
for
cash-constrained
farmers.
Adeyemi
and
Oladele
(2021)
established that even the cheap drip bottle irrigation systems have a startup price that
is beyond reach when there is no credit facility or subsidy. Such investment barriers
deter the adopters, particularly communities with limited initial cash flow, despite the
prospective future savings.
The cost-benefit analysis indicates that drip bottle irrigation has the potential to
increase marketable yields, hence the investment potential for the farmer. Njoroge et al.
(2018) indicated that the tomato growers using drip bottle irrigation saw an increase in
the quality and volume of fruits by 20-30% when compared with their peers using flood
irrigation. Such yield improvement results in high profitability, hence the attractiveness
of the system despite the high initial investment.
Moreover, the maintenance cost and lifespan of drip bottle irrigation also lie at the core
of determining the overall cost-efficiency of the system. Observations by Chukwu et al.
(2020) note that, despite the overall efficacy of the component parts of drip bottle
systems revealing long lifespans, the necessity to frequently replace emitters and
tubing due to clogging or abrasion may lead to increased expenditures. These
maintenance expenses must be incorporated into the determination of the overall
possession cost against the conventional modes of irrigation.
The detailed conditions that influence cost-effectiveness do count. It has been observed
by Ochieng et al. (2022) that the locations where the supply of water is irregular or
where the value of water is high have the greatest economic advantage by the utilization
of drip bottle irrigation. But locations where water is just obtainable and the value of
labor is low might not have the tremendous economic advantage to adopt drip irrigation.
Government policies and subsidy programs are crucial for increasing the cost-
effectiveness of drip bottle irrigation. Kebede et al. (2019) demonstrated that
subsidized inputs and access to microfinance significantly increased adoption rates

19
through the elimination of initial financial costs, hence increasing the net Economic
benefits for the agricultural producers. Such policies are crucial for encouraging the use
of drip irrigation technology among smallholder tomato production.
Finally, the integration of drip bottle irrigation with other financially beneficial
agricultural techniques increases overall profitability. Banerjee et al. (2021) explained
how the integration of drip irrigation with technologies such as mulching, integrated
management of pests, and organic fertilization minimizes costs but boosts yields. Such
integration brings the highest return on investment and fortifies the argument for the
use of drip bottle irrigation systems.
1.3.1 2.5 Conclusion
The use of drip irrigation with drip bottles for growing tomatoes offers an encouraging
solution for increasing the efficiency of water and boosting agricultural production.
However, the introduction of the system has its determinants, such as the availability of
resources, technical skills, as well as budgetary limitations. Addressing the issues for
the installation and maintenance of the systems requires awareness interventions and
assistance for the farmers. In spite of the initial investment challenges, drip bottle
irrigation has shown its profitability in many cases. It has optimal benefits with long-
term effects in regard to the savings on water as well as boosted productivity. Future
research and policy efforts should focus on making drip bottle systems more
accessible,
improving
technical
support,
and
maximizing
cost-effectiveness
for
smallholder farmers.

3.6.2 DATA ANALYSIS AND PRESENTATION OF THE FINDINGS

22
3.6.3 4.0 Introduction
This chapter presented an analysis and discussion of the findings from the study on the
use of drip bottle irrigation for tomato cultivation.
3.6.4 4.1 Germination performance
Germination counts were taken in April for both the drip bottle and conventional
watering treatments. The average germination percentage under drip bottle irrigation
was 91.3%, while the control group (manual watering) recorded 84.5%.
This showed that drip irrigation with bottles supports better germination, potentially due
to the consistent moisture supply provided at the root zone, reducing seed stress and
desiccation during critical early stages.
3.6.5 4.2 Plant Height, Leaf Area, and Stem Girth
Table 1 presents data on tomato plant height, leaf area, and stem girth under both drip

3.6.8 3.6.15 4.6 Factors influencing the adoption of drip bottle irrigation
among tomato farmers
The table below shows that the results indicated that the adoption of drip bottle
irrigation was influenced by several related factors:
Factor
Percentage out of 100
Access to Information/Training
76%
Perceived Water Scarcity
68%
Affordability of Materials

Perceived Labor Savings
64%

55%

27
The table above shows the key factors that influenced tomato farmers to adopt drip
bottle irrigation. This was based on data collected during a six-month experimental
study at Bishop Barham University farm. The design of the experiment allowed close
observation and interaction with participants from planting to harvesting, providing clear
insights into the adoption process. The results indicated that both technical and socio-
economic factors shaped adoption, pointing out where farmer engagement and support
could have the most significant effect.
The most important factor, mentioned by 76% of farmers, was access to information
and training. During the experiment, farmers who received demonstrations and
guidance on how to set up and maintain the drip bottle system were much more likely to
adopt it. The practical orientation of the study being carried out on the university farm
allowed the researcher to conduct hands-on training sessions. These sessions
demystified the irrigation process for some fellow farmers, increasing their confidence
in using the technology. Some of the farmers without access to such knowledge were
hesitant or unwilling to adopt the system, indicating a strong need for extension
services and capacity building in rural areas.
Affordability of materials, cited by 72% of respondents, was another major influence.
Since the drip bottle system primarily used recycled plastic bottles, the setup cost was
significantly lower compared to conventional drip irrigation systems that require
expensive pipes and emitters. The researcher appreciated that they could locally source
the bottles and make simple modifications to them without needing external support.
This made the system especially appealing to smallholder farmers with limited capital.
Throughout the six-month experiment, it was evident that once farmers realized they
could implement the system with minimal financial input, their willingness to adopt
increased significantly.
Perceived water scarcity was reported as a motivator by 68% of the farmers. During dry
spells in the experimental period, conventional watering methods proved inefficient and

28
labor-intensive.
4.7 Challenges faced by farmers in implementing drip irrigation. In contrast, the drip
irrigation system delivered a consistent and localized water source, thereby alleviating
plant stress and enhancing growth. Agricultural practitioners acknowledged the
system's capability to conserve water while ensuring sufficient soil moisture levels. This
perspective on efficiency was particularly pronounced during the mid-growth and
flowering phases, periods characterized by elevated water requirements. It underscored
the significance of the system in conditions where water availability is restricted.
The labour savings perceived were also instrumental, cited by 64% of the respondents.
Even though the initial setup of the drip bottles involved elbow grease, watering
repeatedly needed much less daily labour when compared with buckets or other
conventional methods. This was highly appreciated during peak periods such as
harvesting or weddings. Across the six-month pilot, the majority of the farmers stated
that the system saved time for other activities on the farm, increasing efficiency.
Women and old farmers, who are the actual ones who would water by hand in the
majority of the smallholder farms, most appreciated the benefit.
Finally, the impact of peer influence and local implementation proved to be considerable.
Some 55% of farmers identified the factor as one of the motivating forces to adopt the
system. Farmers who saw the advantage experienced by neighbors or fellow adopters
were more disposed to investigate the system further themselves. This system of
social endorsement helped considerably to dispel the uncertainty. In the trial period,
several of those who were initially ambivalent were persuaded otherwise by seeing
better tomato development and produce on adjoining fields. The collaborative
atmosphere of the university farm facilitated the informal dissemination of knowledge
and results among participants, thereby enhancing adoption through observed success.

29
Lastly, the Bishop Barham University farm study revealed that the acceptance of drip
bottle irrigation is influenced by different factors such as technical knowledge, cost
consideration, availability of water, labour intensity, and social influence.
3.6.9 4.7 Challenges faced by farmers in implementing drip bottle irrigation
Despite the method’s benefits, several challenges were reported by farmers
using drip bottles for tomato cultivation.

Challenges in Drip Bottle Irrigation System

challenges with the drip bottle irrigation system.

30
Figure 3: Challenges in the drip bottle irrigation system
These challenges highlight the importance of addressing both technical and agronomic
issues
when
promoting
low-cost
irrigation
systems
in
smallholder
farming
environments.
The most commonly reported challenge was the outbreak of early blight, affecting 44%
of farmers. This fungal disease thrives in humid environments, and the use of drip
bottles, especially when combined with mulch, creates localized microclimates
conducive to its development. Although drip irrigation typically reduces leaf wetness
and disease spread compared to overhead irrigation, poor sanitation, bottle positioning
near the base of the plants, and insufficient crop rotation practices may have
contributed to disease incidence. This finding emphasizes the need for integrating
proper disease management strategies when introducing new irrigation methods.
Uneven water distribution, cited by 39% of the farmers, was another major obstacle. In
the early stages of the experiment, some farmers struggled to maintain uniform bottle
spacing and control the rate of water release. Bottles with inconsistent hole sizes or
blockages in the cap led to either excessive water in some spots or inadequate supply

31
in others. This variability resulted in irregular plant growth and, in some cases, wilting.
While the system is low-cost, its effectiveness depends heavily on proper setup and
maintenance, something that many farmers were not initially well-equipped to manage
without hands-on guidance.
Closely related to this was the difficulty in bottle installation, reported by 33% of
participants. While the idea of reusing plastic bottles was widely accepted, the process
of modifying and setting up dozens of bottles across a field proved to be laborious and
time-consuming for some farmers. Properly piercing the caps to control flow,
positioning the bottles near the root zones, and securing them in place required more
effort than anticipated, especially for older farmers or those with limited labor. This
challenge was most evident during the transplanting and early vegetative stages of the
tomato crop.
Another significant issue was the lack of technical knowledge, which affected 39% of
the farmers. While training was provided during the experimental phase, it became clear
that a one-time demonstration was insufficient for some participants to fully grasp the
method. For instance, many did not understand how to regulate water flow or adjust for
soil type and crop stage. This knowledge gap often led to either under- or over-irrigation.
The results suggest that continuous extension support or follow-up training is essential
for successful long-term adoption of the system.
Lastly, wilting in non-irrigated areas (28%) and pest nesting around bottles (16%) were
reported as minor but relevant concerns. Where bottles were incorrectly placed or
omitted, tomato plants experienced wilting due to insufficient moisture. Additionally, a
few farmers observed that plastic bottles left on the ground attracted pests like ants
and snails, especially during the rainy season. Although these issues were less common,
they highlight the need for proper coverage and hygiene. Preventative practices, such as
regular bottle cleaning and field monitoring, were not consistently followed. This
reduced the system's effectiveness in certain plots.
In conclusion, while the experimental research at Bishop Barham University farm

32
confirmed the potential of drip bottle irrigation to support tomato cultivation under
water-limited conditions, the findings also reveal key implementation challenges. These
range from agronomic issues like early blight and wilting to technical barriers such as
uneven water distribution and poor system setup. Addressing these challenges through
farmer education, follow-up support, and system design improvements will be essential
for scaling up the use of this low-cost irrigation method in Uganda and similar contexts.
3.6.10 4.10 Cost-effectiveness of drip bottle irrigation compared to conventional
irrigation
A comparative economic analysis (see Section 4.4.1) demonstrated the clear cost
advantage of using drip bottles over conventional watering methods.

The comparative economic analysis, carried out during a six-month experimental study
at Bishop Barham University farm, clearly highlights the cost-effectiveness of drip bottle
irrigation compared to conventional watering methods. As shown in the table, tomato
farmers using the drip bottle system achieved a total yield of 78 kg per plot, which was
significantly higher than the 60 kg obtained using traditional methods such as watering
cans or hoses. This yield increase of 30% demonstrates that a more consistent and
targeted supply of water at the root zone promotes better plant growth, fruit
development, and ultimately, higher productivity.
In terms of revenue, farmers using drip bottle irrigation earned UGX 156,000, compared

33
to UGX 120,000 earned through conventional irrigation. This difference can be directly
attributed to the improved yield. Since both groups sold their tomatoes at the same
market price, the revenue variation stems solely from the quantity of harvest. The data
indicate that drip bottle irrigation not only enhances agricultural output but also
translates into increased income, making it an attractive option for smallholder farmers
who aim to maximize their return on investment.
It is also notable that the total input cost for drip bottle irrigation was slightly lower
(UGX 45,000) than for the ordinary watering practice (UGX 50,000). Financial savings
are largely due to reduced labour needs and reduced water use. Unlike the traditional
method, where steady efforts for manual irrigation were needed, with high volume water
use, the drip bottle method used recycled plastic bottles, sometimes which were free or
very cheap, with lower daily labour demand after installation. Lower operational costs,
albeit with an initial low investment for the adaptation and installation of the bottles,
accounted for the total cost-saving nature of this technique.
Owing to increased revenue and reduced input expenditures, the net profit derived from
drip bottle irrigation significantly exceeded that of traditional watering, amounting to
UGX 111,000 in contrast to UGX 70,000.
This is a 58.5% increase in profit, reinforcing the economic viability of the system. For
smallholder farmers with limited financial resources, this profit margin can make a
meaningful difference in household income, school fees, or reinvestment into farming. It
also demonstrates that sustainable farming techniques can be both environmentally
friendly and financially rewarding.
Water use efficiency was another major benefit. The drip bottle method used
approximately 100 liters per plot per day, while the conventional method consumed
around 200 liters—a 50% reduction in water use. In regions like Uganda, where rainfall is
seasonal and unpredictable, conserving water is crucial for maintaining agricultural
output. The significant savings in water without sacrificing yield not only reduce
production costs but also support environmental sustainability. In summary, the
findings from Bishop Barham University farm confirm that drip bottle irrigation is a low-
cost, high-impact innovation that can enhance both productivity and profitability for

34
smallholder tomato farmers.
3.6.11 4.11 In conclusion
The findings from this study clearly demonstrate that drip bottle irrigation significantly
improves tomato productivity, enhances water use efficiency, and increases farmer
profitability. Adoption is primarily driven by affordability, perceived benefits, and access
to training. However, technical barriers such as clogging and poor setup highlight the
need for capacity building. Therefore, when the issues are resolved, these challenges
through community engagement, technical support, and low-cost innovations, drip
bottle irrigation can be an effective, sustainable solution for smallholder tomato
growers in Uganda and other water-scarce regions.

35
3.6.12 CHAPTER FIVE:
3.6.13 SUMMARY OF FINDINGS, DISCUSSION, CONCLUSIONS, AND
RECOMMENDATIONS
3.6.14 5.1 Summary of findings
This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of drip bottle irrigation on tomato growth
and yield as compared to conventional irrigation methods. Conducted over six months
at Bishop Barham University farm using an experimental design, the study revealed
several key outcomes:
Germination Performance: Drip bottle irrigation yielded a higher germination rate (91.3%)
compared to conventional watering (84.5%), attributed to consistent root zone moisture.
Growth Parameters: Tomatoes under drip irrigation recorded higher averages in plant
height (48.3 cm), leaf area (140 cm²), and stem girth (1.8 cm) than conventional
methods, although differences were not statistically significant at p < 0.05.
Yield and Fruit Quality: Drip bottle irrigation led to significantly higher yields (78 kg per
plot vs. 60 kg) and larger fruit sizes (125 g vs. 110 g average fruit weight).
Economic Impact: Drip irrigation was more cost-effective. It generated a higher net
profit (UGX 120,000 vs. UGX 70,000) and used 50% less water each day (100L vs. 200L).
Adoption Factors: Key drivers included access to training (76%), affordability (72%),
perceived water scarcity (68%), and labor savings (64%).
Implementation Challenges: Farmers faced challenges such as early blight (44%),
uneven water distribution (39%), technical gaps (39%), and difficulty installing bottles
(33%).
3.6.15 5.1 Discussions
The study reinforces the role of low-cost, resource-efficient technologies like drip bottle
irrigation
in
transforming
smallholder
agriculture.
The
superior
performance
in
germination, growth, and yield can be attributed to the method’s ability to deliver
consistent water directly to the root zone. The improved fruit quality and uniformity
further point to better nutrient uptake and reduced physiological stress in plants.

36
Environmental considerations are important. According to Singh and Kumar (2022),
water scarcity and unpredictable rainfall in many tomato-growing areas push farmers to
look for better irrigation methods. The water-saving benefit of drip irrigation is a strong
incentive, particularly in drought-prone regions where traditional irrigation methods are
ineffective and wasteful.
Economically, this method provides a practical and affordable solution for farmers with
limited funds. Reusing plastic bottles significantly lowers setup costs compared to
commercial drip systems. And water and labour savings contribute to profits. This
reaffirms previous findings showing how the simplest drip irrigation systems could
increase water productivity by 30 to 50% for smallholder horticulture.
Mwangi et al. (2020) have outlined that the localized compatibility of drip irrigation
products highly matters. It is made clear that the affordability and accessibility of the
machinery, along with localized weather conditions, significantly enhance the utilization
of drip bottle irrigation. Also, the sustainability of the materials and the compatibility of
the systems with local tomato varieties determine sustained usage.
Nevertheless, challenges like early blight and water distribution issues imply that simple
solutions require careful thought. Proper training, regular maintenance, and proper
disease control measures lead to the sustainability of benefits. Also, peer teaching and
social acceptance remain imperative aspects of the development of adopters,
highlighting the role of community-based extension services.
Environmental sustainability is one of the fields that has a great influence. It
significantly lowers the use of water, which is very valuable to a country like Uganda,
where water scarcity is the norm at times. It lowers the dependency on the hiring of
labor hours, which has a high implication on the weaker sections of society who
normally shoulder these responsibilities, particularly women and the elderly.

37
5.2 Conclusion
From the study research data, the following were the outcomes:
It also drastically enhances the tomato growth and production. It maintains the soil
moisture steady at the root zone, allowing easy emergence of the seed as well as the
development of the fruit.
It is also cheaper and water-friendly than the traditional methods of watering plants. It
therefore enhances the earnings as well as the cost reduction. Adoption is also highly
responsive to access to training, affordability, and perceived scarcity. Practical
demonstrations as well as peer influence also highly influence farmer decision-making.
Despite the advantages, the challenges, such as the requirement for technical skills,
disease incidence, and installation problems, discourage large-scale acceptance. This
indicates the importance of sustained technical support and education among
communities.
The drip bottle irrigation system provides an effective, low-cost solution for the
smallholder growers. Through the integration of training and extension services, it can
sustain climate-smart agriculture with the increase in the availability of food.
3.6.16 5.3 Recommendations
Based on the results of this research, the following are suggested:
1. Produce simplified technical pamphlets or handbooks in local languages on how to
use and set up optimal bottle irrigation systems, and how to troubleshoot problems.
2. Promote community-led platforms for successful adopters to transfer their
experiences and practical insights to others for facilitating peer-to-peer learning.
3. Incorporate drip bottle irrigation in agricultural extension and climate adaptation
plans to support the use of water in sustainable ways and increase resilience to drought.
4. Promote the inter-university, NGO, and farmer association collaboration to finalize
and customize the strategy for various crops, soils, and agro-ecological conditions.
5. Offer the startups supplies such as bottles or pre-pierced lids whenever practicable,
particularly for the most vulnerable, such as women, the aged, or youth-headed families.

38
5.4 Areas for further research
Further study should investigate how continuous use of bottle-based drip irrigation
affects soil moisture retention, nutrient leaching, and microbial activity over multiple
growing seasons.
Another study is needed on how factors like gender, income level, education, and
cultural beliefs affect the adoption of low-cost irrigation technologies.
