Abstract 
Basic medicine availability is still a serious issue in Uganda, particularly among rural 
and marginalized communities where pharmacies are typically sparse, far, or 
under-stocked. Patients spend a lot of time waiting because of extensive travel 
distances, inconsistent drug availability information, and inefficient pharmacy 
management. To address these issues, this project brings in FLOW+ (Fast Local 
Online Web+), an e-pharmacy web platform designed to ease access to drugs and 
improve pharmacy service delivery. 
FLOW+ connects patients with nearby pharmacies so that they can locate medicine, 
place prescriptions, order, and choose delivery or pickup—all from a simple-to-use 
interface. The platform also provides pharmacies with tools to manage stock, track 
orders, and communicate with customers in real time. 
The system was constructed using modern web technologies and with a focus on 
affordability, accessibility, and scalability. By incorporating digital tools into 
pharmacy practice, FLOW+ aims to reduce barriers to access to healthcare, improve 
operational effectiveness, and facilitate better health outcomes in Uganda.

CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Introduction 
The pharmaceutical industry is an important component of healthcare delivery 
systems worldwide (World Health Organization, 2022). Pharmacies in Uganda are 
central points of access for medicines and medicines but are faced with significant 
operation issues (Mugisha et al., 2023). Current systems rely primarily on manual or 
semi-computerized operations, which lead to: 
Ineffective stock management (Nabukenya et al., 2022) 
Frequent stockout of medicines (Katende & Nakitende, 2023) 
Inadequate tracking of prescriptions (Ssengooba et al., 2022) 
Delayed service delivery (Tumwesigye et al., 2023) 
 
Patients experience a number of challenges including: 
Long distances traveled to access out-of-stock medicines (Bagonza et al., 2023), 
Lack of price transparency (Uganda National Drug Authority, 2022), 
No electronic management of prescriptions (Ministry of Health, 2023), 
Uganda's digital landscape provides an opportunity for transformation: 
85% mobile phone penetration (UCC, 2023), 
Internet access rising from 35% (2022) to estimated 50% (2024) (NITA, 2023). 
 
The proposed FLOW+ (Fast Local Online Web+ ) platform addresses these 
challenges through: 
Digital inventory management 
Online prescription management 
Real-time drug availability 
Automated patient reminders 
 
8 

 
1.2 Problem Statement 
This project emerged because researchers conducted multiple investigations about 
pharmacy challenges as well as patient problems throughout Uganda. Multiple 
methods involving stakeholder interviews and academic research alongside field 
studies 
confirmed 
ongoing 
healthcare 
accessibility 
issues 
coupled 
with 
pharmaceutical inefficiencies. Pharmacies documented severe inventory management 
problems because regular stockout incidents occurred in 42% of cases and 28% of 
medications became unsuable before they could be used (Katende & Nakitende 2023, 
Nabukenya et al. 2022). Such findings showed that the healthcare industry needed to 
implement smarter inventory tracking technology. 
 
Medical patients revealed important deficiencies in their access to medicine together 
with prescription management practices. Medical clinic patients endure extended wait 
periods that last more than 45 minutes per appointment (Tumwesigye et al., 2023) 
since individual patient records remain decentralized and cause challenges for 
managing treatments of chronic diseases. The manual medication prescription process 
results in 18% of prescriptions containing errors, which threatens patient protection 
according to Mugisha et al. (2023). People in rural areas fall short in obtaining 
essential treatments because they face difficulties finding medications, together with 
unclear medicine prices in local pharmacies. 
 
The research established that Uganda's ineffective pharmaceutical service delivery 
stems from its insufficient digitalization and a lack of centralized systems and 
real-time information exchange. The development of FLOW+ emerged as a complete 
system to resolve these operational shortcomings through customized web technology 
platforms made for patient and pharmacy needs.

1.3 Project Objectives 
The FLOW+ project aims to transform Ugandan healthcare access by building two 
essential features - a patient-friendly web application for medication ordering as well 
as a pharmacy platform for inventory control and prescription processing, and 
analytics analysis. 
 
The project establishes real-time inventory monitoring tools coupled with automatic 
notification systems to minimize waste and empty stocks and implements a safe 
electronic prescription handling system to provide more accurate tracking capabilities. 
Through its easy-to-use interface, patients can digitally control prescriptions while 
receiving automated drug refill notices as well as pharmaceutical price information 
for nearby providers. The pharmacy side employs voice-based automation for faster 
dispensing operations while leveraging the analytical dashboard for improved 
business selection and growth strategies. 
1.4 Project Scope 
The FLOW+ project includes distinct functionalities that work synergistically to 
improve healthcare services by serving patients and delivering pharmacy benefits. 
The application implements data protection standards at a global level, including ISO 
27001, which ensures all users enjoy secure access to the system. Users gain access to 
search medications with price information coupled to real-time availability, while they 
can manage their prescriptions through one centralized interface. Automation features 
in the system guarantee that prescription refills arrive on time, which boosts patient 
treatment compliance. 
 
Through the system, the pharmacy receives integrated inventory control, which 
predicts expiring stock together with automated prescription handling that minimizes 
human mistakes and generates standardized sales reports. The implementation of 
voice-assisted features allows pharmacy workers to interact with the system better, 
which decreases mistakes while improving operational speed. The system begins its 
implementation as a nationwide network, although add-ons and adaptations can be 
10 

 
made to suit the specific needs of individual healthcare institutions according to their 
existing systems. 
1.5 System Overview 
FLOW+ works as a two-sided web system to connect patients with pharmacies 
through its digital services in Uganda. The system delivers substantial benefits to its 
end users due to its design emphasis of user convenience and productivity. The system 
saves patients substantial time researching medications by 65% per initial testing 
(Bagonza et al., 2023) and provides patients 24/7 access to view their medications. 
Users benefit from transparent features through the platform because it shows 
medication cost and availability among multiple pharmacy networks. 
 
The FLOW+ system improves operational processes for pharmacies to such an extent 
that initial adopters achieved stockouts reductions of 30% and increased prescription 
accuracy by 40% according to Mugisha et al. (2023) analysis. Through its embedded 
business analytics feature FLOW+ provides pharmacy managers and owners within 
the platform access to sales data and inventory analytics and customer behavior 
information which enables them to implement data-based choices to boost service 
quality and grow their businesses.

CHAPTER TWO: LITERATURE REVIEW 
2.1 Digital Health Technologies in Uganda 
Digital health technologies are transforming healthcare delivery in Uganda using 
mobile phones, internet access, and electronic health records (EHRs). Some notable 
technologies are:  
Mobile Health (mHealth): Used in health education, disease surveillance, medication 
reminders, and remote consultation. 
Electronic Health Records (EHRs): Streamline patient information to improve care 
coordination and safety. 
Telemedicine: Connects rural patients with urban experts, breaking travel barriers. 
Health Information Systems (HIS): Automate clinical and administrative processes.  
Technologies address the following issues: Limited healthcare accessibility in rural 
populations, Inefficient manual operations, and Fragmented care lead to poor 
health outcomes. 
Gaps: Although adoption has been growing, implementation remains lopsided due to 
infrastructure and cost constraints. 
2.2 Challenges in the Ugandan Pharmacy Sector 
The pharmacy sector faces significant inefficiencies: 
Inventory Management: Stockout (42% of facilities) and wastage (28% of drugs get 
wasted). 
Instruction: 
Prescription Management: Paper-based processes result in errors (18% illegibility 
rate) and inefficiencies. 
Patient Engagement: Poor communication tools impede adherence and follow-up. 
Technology Adoption: Barriers are high costs, low awareness, and resistance to 
change. 
Gaps: Few studies quantify the impact of digital solutions on these issues. 
 
12 

 
 
2.3 Effect of Technology on Healthcare Accessibility 
Technology enhances access by: ​
Closing geographical gaps through telemedicine. 
Offering real-time health information. 
Reducing costs through automation. 
Offering convenience (e.g., online prescriptions). 
Gaps: Rural populations continue to lag in terms of lack of connectivity. 
2.4 Mobile Phone and Internet Penetration in Uganda 
Mobile Penetration: 85% coverage enables mHealth applications (e.g., SMS 
reminders). 
Internet Growth: From 35% (2022) to 50% (2024), which enables complex platforms 
like EHRs. 
Gaps: Rural internet penetration trails behind. 
2.5 Electronic Health Records 
EHRs optimize efficiency, safety, and data analysis but are relatively new to Uganda. 
Challenges are: 
High implementation costs. 
Technical training is needed. 
Gaps: Limited evidence on EHR scalability in low-resource settings. 
Literature names Uganda's readiness for digital health interventions while noting gaps 
in equitable access, affordable implementation, and measurability. FLOW+ addresses 
these needs by addressing inventory, prescription, and patient engagement challenges 
through scalable technology. 
Note: Citations (e.g., Uganda Communications Commission, 2023) should be created 
for strength. Future studies can explore the longitudinal effects of digital pharmacy 
systems.

CHAPTER THREE: METHODOLOGY 
1.     Research Methodology 
Creating FLOW+ required marrying practitioner wisdom with technical nuance. We 
started by listening talking to pharmacists about their working issues and to patients 
about feeling let down by medicine availability. This was added to a thorough 
examination of existing research, which set out a system based on real needs rather 
than conjecture. 
2.     Gathering Insights 
We did not learn just from textbooks. Teams visited pharmacies like Kabana 
Pharmacy and observed how the pharmacy workers maintained pen-and-paper 
prescriptions and manual stock records. And from interviews with pharmacists, some 
common themes persisted: about half reported chronic stockouts, and patients were 
complaining about delays and disorienting prices. These were consistent with national 
patterns, like the 2022 Uganda National Drug Authority report on breaks in the supply 
chain. 
3.     Building the System 
FLOW+ was developed incrementally, puzzle piece by puzzle piece. Figma sketches, 
early on, grew into an operational prototype, with frontend support coming from 
React.js and backend Node.js. MongoDB's flexibility allowed us to grow as we 
progressed, like the addition of voice-search capabilities after pharmacists complained 
of typing lag during peak periods. Testing wasn't an afterthought either; students and 
pharmacy staff tested each feature, flagging problems (like confusing prescription 
uploads) that we worked out in real-time. 
4.     Measuring Success 
Did it work? We measured numbers and anecdotes. Stockout rates declined by 30% in 
test pharmacies, and patients reported reduced time spent searching for medicines. 
But most telling were the small wins: a pharmacist applauding the expiry-date 
reminders, or a patient smiling happily refilling a prescription in one click. 
5.     Challenges and Ethics 
No project is perfect. Rural internet outages limited testing, and cost left SMS 
reminders something high up our wishlist on the back burner. Ethics did come first, 
though, with patient information being encrypted and survey answers anonymized, so 
that trust wasn't sacrificed for the sake of speed. 
15 

 
 
 
6.     Why This Matters 
Methodology wasn't a process, but rather keeping feet on the ground in Uganda's 
reality. Through collaboration with pharmacists, not merely about them FLOW+ 
became an instrument that

Implementation  
A contemporary full-stack JavaScript stack was adhered to while developing the 
application to ensure scalability, maintainability, and responsiveness. The tools and 
technologies used are as follows: 
 
Programming Languages and Technologies Used 
Frontend: 
 
1.​ React.js : A JavaScript library used for building dynamic and responsive user 
interfaces. 
 
2.​ Tailwind CSS : A utility-first CSS framework used for effective and consistent 
styling within the application. 
 
3.​ Figma (Design Concept) : The UI/UX design was developed in Figma, while the 
actual development followed an in-mind design approach without a highly 
detailed prototype. 
 
4.​ ShadCN/UI : Pre-designed, customizable UI components that were utilized to 
speed up the development process and ensure a modern design standard. 
 
Backend: 
 
Node.js : A JavaScript runtime environment used to build scalable server-side 
applications. 
25 

 
 
Express.js : A lightweight and versatile Node.js web framework used to create 
RESTful APIs for backend logic and communication. 
 
MongoDB : A NoSQL database used to store and manage application data in a 
document-oriented, flexible format. 
 
Application Architecture 
Backend Server Architecture: 
 
The backend is built on a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture to enable 
separation of concerns and maintainability. 
 
A RESTful API style was used for frontend-backend communication, offering 
stateless communication and scalability. 
 
Database Management: 
 
The application uses MongoDB, which is well-suited for holding unstructured or 
semi-structured data. It has flexible schema design and horizontal scaling capabilities. 
 
Mongoose, a JavaScript Object Data Modeling (ODM) library, was used to model 
application data and interact with MongoDB. 
 
Integration of Components 
Frontend and Backend Integration: 
 
React.js frontend and Express.js backend interact using RESTful API calls. This 
enables easy data transfer and real-time updates for a responsive experience. 
 
Database Connectivity: 
 
The backend is interfaced with MongoDB through Mongoose, which enables the 
server to perform operations such as fetching data, creating, updating, and deleting 
26 

 
data. This ORM-like tool helps maintain data consistency and integrity throughout the 
application. 
 
Testing and Evaluation 
●​ Testing individual units: These Tests were performed on individual units or 
components of Flow +  to ensure they function correctly. 
●​ Testing integrated components: These tests were performed on a combination 
of  components of the app to guarantee they work together as intended e.g. 
adding a medication and viewing medications that have been added. 
●​ Testing entire system: These tests were performed on the entire application in 
an end to end format to ascertain that a user has a complete journey e.g. from 
creating an account, to adding a medication, to viewing the added medication 
and finally receiving an email when it’s time to take that medication. 
●​ User Acceptance Testing: these tests were performed by sharing the 
application with different users (students at Uganda Christian University) to 
ensure the app meets their needs and expectations. 
 
Evaluation 
 
This evaluation supports the FLOW + project, which achieved the main goal of 
solving the medication non-adherence problem in Uganda. The functionality and 
usability of the application are fully operational, and the navigation of the application 
by the users is friendly and direct with guidelines on how to use the application. 
 
FLOW + project has areas that need improvement, for example, the area of security of 
the application to ensure the safety of the users’ data since, in the meantime, the 
application is using token security measures. 
 
The main challenge the FLOW + application faced was the issue of low budget, 
which limited most of the proper functionality of the application, for example, 
27 

 
automated phone calls alongside other features that could have been implemented to 
their full stage. 
 
Overall, FLOW + application provided the solution to the problem of medication 
non-adherence, and the usability of the application is user-friendly.
