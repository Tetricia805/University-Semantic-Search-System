ABSTRACT 
The increasing occurrence of flooding events due to climate change poses a serious 
threat to crop production in sub-Saharan Africa, where Solanum aethiopicum Shum 
serves as an important leafy vegetable for food, nutritional and income security. 
This study evaluated the post-flooding recovery potential and growth responses of 
three Solanum aethiopicum Shum genotypes E11, E15, and E16 under controlled 
flooding conditions at Uganda Christian University. A randomized split plot design 
was used, subjecting plants to two weeks of partial submergence followed by 
recovery monitoring for a period of 14days. Results revealed significant genotypic 
variations in recovery time and, survival rates as measured using physiological 
parameters (such as chlorophyll content), and morphological traits (including leaf 
area, root length, and biomass accumulation). Genotype E11 exhibited the fastest 
recovery and highest survival rate (99.17%), while E16 demonstrated superior 
biomass production and root development. Analysis of the physiological traits 
showed that E15 and E16 maintained higher chlorophyll content during the 
recovery phase, indicating efficient restoration of photosynthetic capacity. 
Morphological recovery strategies differed, with E11 focusing on fewer but larger 
leaves, and E15 and E16 were favouring new leaf proliferation. These findings 
highlight the genetic diversity in flooding tolerance among Solanum aethiopicum 
Shum genotypes and underscore the potential for breeding flood-resilient cultivars 
to ensure food security in flood-prone regions.

CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Back ground  
Solanum aethiopicum Shum also known as African eggplant, Solanum aethiopicum 
(shum), is a deciduous shrub in the family Solanaceae which is grown for its edible 
leaves that are cooked and eaten as vegetables. This species is believed to have 
originated from Africa and was domesticated from the wild Solanum anguivi Lam. 
(Anaso, 1991).  African eggplant is a highly branching plant which can grow up to 2 
m (6.6 ft.) in height. It’s a short plant with small, smooth leaves. Its shoots are 
edible, but its small fruits are bitter and less preferred. The leaves of the plant are 
arranged alternately on the stems and have smooth or lobed margins. Leaf blades 
may reach up to 30 cm (11.8 in) in length and 21 cm (8.3 in) in width. The leaf 
petioles are oval or elliptical in shape, reaching up to 11 cm (4.3 in) in length. 
(Regine Tchientche Kamga et al., 2015). Plants produce clusters of up to 12 white 
flowers which develop into egg or spindle-shaped berries which are red to orange 
in colour with a smooth or grooved surface depending on variety. (Adeniji et al., 
2019). African eggplant may also be referred to as scarlet eggplant, bitter tomato, 
mock tomato, garden egg or Ethiopian.   
Solanum aethiopicum Shum grows well in well drained deep soils and a pH of 
around 5.5-6.8. Solanum aethiopicum Shum also requires conditions that are warm 
and humid in order to thrive well. When planting Shum, for better performance in 
terms of yields, seeds are first planted in a nursery bed 15cm apart and 20cm with 
in rows (Aguessy et al., 2021). The seedlings are then transplanted to main garden 
when they reach 15cm-20cm in height. Shum benefits from frequent irrigation in 
the dry season particularly when fruiting. Young leaves of Solanum aethiopicum 
Shum can be harvested for 45-60 days of growth Shum. (G. Sseremba, 2019). 
Solanum aethiopicum Shum is known for its nutritional value and income-
generating potential for farmers. The crop is rich in both macro- and micro-
nutrient compared with other vegetables and is suitable for ensuring food and 
nutritional security. (Kamga, R.T). It also possesses several medicinal properties 
and is currently employed in the treatment of high blood pressure, diabetes, 
cholera, urinary complications as well as skin infections in humans. (Han et al., 
2021). All these advantages show that Solanum aethiopicum Shum is an important 

2 
 
crop in as far as food security is concerned in many parts of the country especially 
in local communities. Research shows that over four million individual in Uganda 
deal in the production, trade and consumption of Solanum aethiopicum Shum 
making it of economic importance to the economy of Uganda (Nakyewa et al., 
2021). However, since Solanum aethiopicum Shum is cultivated mostly in wetlands 
since it’s a leafy vegetable and it requires enough water for leaf establishment, its 
production is threatened by prolonged flooding since wet lands are prone to 
flooding. This is due to climate change, poor drainage and many other human 
activities that disrupt the water movement and drainage hence causing floods.  
Flooding is an environmental stress that hinders crop growth and productivity 
severely especially in regions of Uganda that are prone to flooding due to extreme 
weather changes or climate change. Floods were the second gravest agricultural 
disaster, next to droughts, as they were responsible for $21B in crop and livestock 
loss from 2008 to 2018 in the developing world (FAO 2021). Flooding refers to an 
overflow of water onto normally dry land, which is mainly caused by heavy rainfall 
and river overflow. It can occur suddenly (flash flooding) or gradually (river 
flooding) and typically involves significant amounts of water covering an area 
(Mohammad et al., 2022). Flooding in plants (agriculture) can be classified in two 
different for categories depending on the depth of water. The two categories of 
flooding include water-logging and submergence. Water-logging refers to a 
condition where water exists on the surface and only plant roots are surrounded by 
water. On the other hand submergence is a condition where the whole plant is 
partially or completely covered by water (Tian et al., 2020). Flooding causes 
negative effects on the physiological, vegetative growth of vegetables. One of the 
symptoms of the damage caused by flooding is yellowing and death of leaves. 
(Gibbs and Greenway, 2003). The early death of leaves and retarded growth of 
shoots is as a result of the inhibition of nitrogen up take by the plant which 
eventually leads to leaf chlorosis. Leaf chlorosis which is as a result of Nitrogen 
deficiency implies that plants are not able to make their own food leading to 
destruction of the plant Hence a posing a threat to food security (Ezin et al., 
2010). Plant failure to take up nutrients from the soil is due to oxygen deficiency 
caused by floods. Flooding restricts oxygen availability which is important for 
cellular respiration; the in availability of oxygen around the root zone causes 

3 
 
anaerobic conditions that lead to shrinking of plant roots which makes it difficult 
for them to take up nutrients and water for the plant. Anaerobic conditions 
produced due to lack of oxygen, produces toxic by-products for example ethanol 
and lactate (Muhammad Arslan Ashraf, 2012). These two toxic chemicals 
accumulate in plant tissues leading to cell damage and death.  Oxygen deficiency 
due to flooding also leads to photosynthesis reduction, stunted growth, oxidative 
stress and many others (da-Silva & do Amarante, 2020).  
However different studies carried on flooding in plants show that some plants have 
evolved strategies that enable them resist against the period they are subjected to 
flooding. Some studied show that some plants are able to restrict growth through 
keeping the minimum energy and carbon consumption for surviving underwater and 
after the water is removed, these plants recover rapidly. (Zhao et al., 2021). 
Plants like tomatoes produce new adventitious roots that help them with stand the 
flooding conditions (Ezin et al., 2010). Different rice cultivators with stand flood 
periods by restricting shoot elongation as well as carbohydrate consumption, and 
will be recovered when the flooding period is done.  
The study aims to evaluate the recovery responses of different S. aethiopicum 
(shum) genotypes under controlled flooding conditions. Understanding the 
mechanisms and recovery rates will help identify resilient genotypes suitable for 
flood-prone regions hence increasing food productions and ensuring food security. 
1.2 PROBLEM STATEMENT  
Solanum aethiopicum shum, commonly known as African eggplant is a vital leafy 
vegetable cultivated in sub-Saharan Africa for its nutritional and economic value. It 
is recognized for its tolerance to various biotic and abiotic stresses, including heat 
and drought, which makes it a resilient crop in regions facing climate variability 
(Akoroda et al., 2020). However, recent increases in climate-induced flooding have 
posed significant challenges to its production, impacting plant physiology, survival, 
and yield.  Flooding, characterized by water logging and oxygen deprivation in the 
root zone, negatively affects plant growth and metabolism. The magnitude of crop 
losses due to flooding has spread worldwide, with reports indicating a 10–20% yield 
loss in key crops throughout the year due to water logging (Voesenek & Bailey-

4 
 
Serres, 2015). In Africa, unpredictable rainfall patterns and flooding events have 
reduced agricultural productivity, especially in areas where smallholder farmers 
rely on flood-sensitive crops like Solanum aethiopicum shum (Mwadzingeni et al., 
2016). Understanding the recovery mechanisms of crops post-flooding is critical for 
developing resilient varieties. Efforts have been made to identify and promote 
stress-tolerant varieties of Solanum aethiopicum shum. Breeding programs have 
mainly focused on enhancing drought resistance (Danquah et al., 2021). However, 
similar strides in addressing flooding resilience are limited. Agronomic 
interventions, such as raised beds and drainage systems, have also been employed 
to mitigate flooding impacts (Kumwenda et al., 2018). However, these solutions 
remain lacking for unpredictable or prolonged flooding events. Even with the 
acknowledgment of Solanum aethiopicum shum potential as a resilient crop, 
studies on its post-flooding recovery dynamics remain missing. Important questions 
regarding the physiological and morphological responses of different genotypes to 
flooding stress and their subsequent recovery mechanisms remain lacking answers. 
There is also less data on the role of specific genotype traits in determining post-
flooding recovery potential. Understanding the post-flooding recovery potential 
and growth response of Solanum aethiopicum shum genotypes is vital for enhancing 
food security in flood-prone regions. This research can guide the selection of flood-
resilient genotypes, contributing to sustainable agricultural systems. In addition, it 
will provide understandings into plant adaptation mechanisms under stress, aiding 
in the development of targeted breeding strategies to improve resilience not only 
in Solanum aethiopicum Shum but also in other crops. 
1.3 Purpose of study  
The purpose of studying the post-flooding recovery potential and growth response 
of different Solanum aethiopicum (Shum) genotypes is to evaluate their ability to 
adapt and thrive under stress conditions, particularly flooding. This research helps 
in understanding the resilience mechanisms of these genotypes, identifying 
varieties with higher tolerance, and optimizing their cultivation for regions prone 
to flooding. The findings could support crop improvement programs and enhance 
agricultural productivity in flood-affected areas (Apolot et al., 2020).

1.4 objectives  
1.4.1 Main objective  
I. 
To determine the flood tolerance in Solanum aethiopicum Shum for 
increased crop productivity 
1.4.2 Specific objectives  
I. 
To examine the variations in the recovery time among various Solanum 
Aethopicum shum genotypes from flooding stress.  
II. 
 To assess the agronomic performance of the recovered genotypes focusing 
on physiological and morphological changes in response to flood stress.  
1.5 Hypotheses  
1.5.1 Hypothesis 1 
Solanum aethiopicum shum genotypes will exhibit 60-85%recovery rates from 
flooding stress, with certain genotypes demonstrating superior adaptive traits that 
allow them recover more effectively compared to others  (Colmer & Voesenek, 
2009).  
1.5.2 Hypothesis 2 
Recovered Solanum aethiopicum shum genotype from flooding stress will exhibit 
distinct physiological and morphological changes (G. Sseremba, 2019).  
1.6 Scope of study  
This research focused on accessing the recovery potential of different Solanum 
aethiopicum shum genotypes from flooding stress, by identifying those that recover 
faster after a period of flooding. Understanding these responses is crucial for 
developing resilient cultivars that can withstand adverse conditions. This study will 
be conducted in a screen house in Uganda Christian University on three different 
genotypes of Solanum aethiopicum Shum which are E11, E15, and E16. Different 
morphological and physiology parameters for example leaf size, leaf area, 
chlorophyll content, root length will be measured to access recovery rates and 
resilience of the three Solanum aethiopicum Shum genotypes to floods.

1.8 Justification  
Solanum aethiopicum Shum, commonly known as African eggplant or Shum is a 
widely cultivated indigenous vegetable in sub-Saharan Africa. It is a crucial source 
of vitamins, minerals, and dietary fibre, contributing significantly to food security 
and income generation for smallholder farmers. Despite its economic and 
nutritional importance, studies on its response to abiotic stresses, such as flooding, 
remain limited. (Abukutsa-Onyango, M. (2010). Flooding adversely affects plant 
growth by limiting oxygen availability, impairing root functions, and disrupting 
nutrient uptake. Understanding the recovery mechanisms of Solanum aethiopicum 
Shum genotypes can aid in breeding programs focused on flood-resilient genotypes. 
This is particularly important in regions where climate change is increasing the 
frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, like flooding. (Bailey-Serres et 
al. (2012). This research aligns with SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) and SDG 13 (Climate 
Action) by promoting resilient agricultural practices and enhancing the productivity 
of underutilized crops in adverse environmental conditions. (Makombe, 2022) 
1.8 Significance  
Solanum aethiopicum Shum is a staple vegetable in many parts of sub-Saharan 
Africa, valued for its nutritional content, including vitamins A and C, minerals, and 
antioxidants. By identifying flood-tolerant genotypes, this research can ensure 
stable yields in flood-prone areas, directly addressing food insecurity. Grubben, G. 
J. H., & Denton, O. A. (2004). Flooding is one of the most destructive outcomes of 
climate change, particularly in tropical regions. Studying the recovery potential of 
Solanum aethiopicum shum genotypes will help develop climate-resilient cropping 
systems that mitigate the impacts of unpredictable weather patterns. (IPCC Report 
(2021).  
Flood-tolerant varieties of Solanum aethiopicum Shum can stabilize market 
supplies and support the livelihoods of farmers and traders who depend on this 
crop for income generation. Flood-resilient cultivars also reduce the economic 
burden of crop losses due to flooding. (Akinyele, B. O., et al. (2011) 
 

7 
 
1.9 Theoretical frame work  
Flooding is a significant abiotic stressor that disrupts plant growth by creating 
oxygen-deprived conditions that impair root respiration and nutrient uptake, 
leading to oxidative stress and tissue damage (Bailey-Serres et al., 2012). Recovery 
mechanisms, such as root plasticity and energy conservation strategies, vary across 
genotypes and play a vital role in plant survival under such stress (Voesenek & 
Bailey-Serres, 2015). Understanding these genotypic differences is crucial for 
developing stress-resilient crops for tropical and subtropical regions prone to 
seasonal flooding. 
The African indigenous vegetable Solanum aethiopicum (Shum) is vital for food 
security and nutrition, particularly in regions where flooding poses a recurring 
challenge. Its genetic diversity makes it an ideal candidate for exploring traits that 
contribute to stress tolerance and recovery. Evaluating growth metrics, such as 
biomass accumulation and shoot elongation, can provide insights into genotypic 
recovery potential. Additionally, biochemical markers like antioxidative enzyme 
activity and hormonal regulation are critical indicators of flooding tolerance 
(Colmer & Voesenek, 2009). 
This research focuses on assessing the post-flooding recovery and growth responses 
of Solanum aethiopicum (Shum) genotypes to identify traits associated with 
superior resilience. Such findings can guide breeding programs aimed at enhancing 
agricultural productivity and sustainability in flood-prone areas (Schippers, 2002).  
The emphasis on indigenous crops aligns with global efforts to bolster agro 
ecosystem resilience to environmental stresses (Sasidharan et al., 2017).

CHAPTER TWO: 
2.0 LITERATURE REVIEW 
2.1 Introduction 
Solanum aethiopicum Shum, commonly known as African eggplant, is widely 
cultivated in sub-Saharan Africa and valued for its nutritional and medicinal uses. 
Despite its resilience in tropical climates, the productivity of Solanum aethiopicum 
Shum can be significantly impacted by environmental stresses such as flooding. 
Since the flooding frequency is said to increase in many regions of sub- Saharan 
due to climate change, understanding the genetics of flooding tolerance in 
Solanum aethiopicum Shum genotypes is  important for breeding resilient varieties 
that can withstand and recover from prevailing flood conditions. 
2.2 Flooding Stress in Crop Plants 
Studies highlight the crop’s resilience to abiotic stresses, including drought and 
salinity (Oyeyemi et al., 2020) but flooding is a major abiotic stress that disrupts 
root oxygen supply, limits gas exchange, and induces oxidative stress, ultimately 
impairing plant growth and development. In flooded conditions, the lack of oxygen 
causes hypoxia or even anoxia (complete absence of oxygen), which inhibits 
aerobic respiration and forces plants to rely on less efficient anaerobic pathways. 
Research has shown that plants can experience physiological and biochemical 
alterations in flooded conditions, including reduced photosynthetic rates, inhibited 
root function, and increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Bailey-
Serres et al., 2012). 
Plants exhibit a wide range of tolerance to flooding, which varies based on species, 
developmental stage, and genotype. Some plants develop morphological 
adaptations, such as adventitious roots and aerenchyma (air-conducting tissue) 
formation, to maintain oxygen flow under flooded conditions. Others rely on 
biochemical responses, like the activation of antioxidant enzymes, to mitigate 
oxidative stress (Colmer & Voesenek, 2009).

2.3 Flooding Tolerance in Solanaceous Crops 
Solanaceous crops, such as tomatoes, potatoes, and eggplants, are generally 
susceptible to flooding stress, yet variations in flooding tolerance have been 
observed across and within species. Studies on Solanum species, particularly 
tomatoes, have identified physiological and biochemical markers that influence 
flooding tolerance. For instance, tomato genotypes with higher tolerance showed 
better root recovery, efficient carbohydrate management, and enhanced 
antioxidant enzyme activity after flooding (Li et al., 2024). Given the shared 
genetic background among solanaceous crops, research findings on related species 
may provide useful insights for understanding flooding tolerance in Solanum 
aethiopicum shum 
2.4 Physiological and Biochemical Responses to Flooding in Plants 
Physiological responses to flooding include reduced photosynthetic efficiency, 
changes in water relations, and alterations in nutrient uptake (Gravatt & Kirby, 
1998). The measurement of chlorophyll content and stomata conductance are 
often used to assess flooding stress, as these parameters reflect the plant's ability 
to photosynthesize and maintain gas exchange under stress. In addition, 
biochemical responses such as the production of antioxidant enzymes (e.g., 
superoxide dismutase, catalase) are critical in scavenging ROS generated during 
flooding, which helps mitigate cellular damage and improve recovery after stress is 
relieved (Ashraf, 2012). 
2.5 Recovery after Flooding Stress 
The recovery phase following a flooding event is essential for the overall tolerance 
and resilience of a plant. Studies indicate that genotypes with better recovery 
potential often exhibit rapid restoration of physiological functions, such as stomata 
conductance and photosynthetic rate, and the re-establishment of root and shoot 
growth (Kozlowski, 1997). In Solanum species, recovery may involve adaptive traits 
like rapid root regeneration, effective carbohydrate allocation, and maintenance 
of ROS-scavenging enzyme activity after flooding. These traits are critical 

11 
 
indicators of a plant’s ability to withstand subsequent stress or return to normal 
productivity levels (Setter & Waters, 2003). 
2.6 Objective one: Genotypic Variation in Flood Recovery. 
2.6.1 Rice Genotypes and Physiological Recovery 
Rani et al. (2015) studied physiological and molecular responses of different rice 
genotypes under flash and stagnant flooding. They compared post-flood survival 
and regeneration after 10 days of de-submergence. The researchers used 
physiological traits (tiller regeneration, chlorophyll content) and molecular 
markers to assess stress response. The research shows that genotypes displayed 
significant variation in their recovery time and capacity. Some showed rapid 
regrowth, indicating better internal oxygenation and carbohydrate reserves. 
However the study lacked integration of these physiological traits with final grain 
yield performance. 
2.6.2 Mungbean Genotypic Differences in Recovery Time 
Islam et al. (2016) assessed flooding effects on growth and maturity of mungbean 
genotypes. They applied a 4-day flooding treatment and monitored regrowth over 
10 days. They measured plant height, leaf development, and days to maturity. 
Results showed that some genotypes resumed growth faster post-flood, while 
others exhibited delayed flowering and reduced leaf count. Recovery variation was 
statistically significant. However no molecular profiling or hormonal assays were 
used to identify underlying mechanisms  
2.6.3 Tomato Genotypes during Flood Stress 
Ezin et al. (2010) evaluated Solanum lycopersicum genotypes at vegetative and 
reproductive stages under varying flooding durations (0–8 days). Post-flood growth 
was tracked over a week. He observed parameters like shoot elongation, 
chlorophyll levels, and biomass. The outcomes were, recovery varied greatly, with 
some genotypes showing greater resilience to both short and extended floods. This 
suggests that tolerance and recovery are development-stage dependent. However 
No yield-level data or hormonal analysis was included. 

12 
 
2.6.4 Natural Variation in Arabidopsis thaliana 
Vashisht et al. (2011) studied 150 Arabidopsis accessions for natural variation in 
flooding tolerance and recovery. Plants were submerged and then DE submerged, 
followed by a 14-day recovery observation. They measured leaf regrowth, 
photosynthesis, and survivability. Results showed that significant intraspecific 
differences were recorded. Some accessions fully recovered, while others 
displayed severe post-flood stunting. However No functional gene annotation was 
applied to identify the traits linked to recovery. 
2.7 Objective 2: Agronomic Performance and Physiological/Morphological 
Changes 
The agronomic performance and physiological responses of various crops, including 
Solanum aethiopicum, to flooding stress are crucial due to increasing extreme 
weather patterns related to climate change. Flooding causes oxygen deprivation, 
affecting plant metabolism, and results in various morphological and physiological 
alterations that can hinder recovery and growth potential. Numerous studies have 
provided insights into these responses, primarily focusing on the mechanisms of 
flooding tolerance and recovery strategies across different plant species. 
 
Research has utilized phenotypic assessments and molecular approaches to analyze 
the physiological and morphological changes in plants under flooding conditions. 
For instance, Chen et al. highlighted the upregulation of disease resistance-related 
proteins during flooding stress in maize, demonstrating the role of programmed 
cell death (PCD) in managing stress responses (Chen et al., 2014). Similarly, 
Komatsu et al. discussed how flooding induces oxygen deprivation, which triggers 
adaptive responses crucial for plant survival in soybean, emphasizing the 
importance of proteomic techniques (Komatsu et al., 2015). Ezin et al. explored 
adventitious root formation in tomatoes and its critical role in nutrient uptake and 
recovery post-flooding, indicating that such adaptations could benefit Solanum 
aethiopicum as well (Ezin et al., 2010). Valliyodan et al. observed that tolerant 
soybean genotypes exhibit a quicker response to flooding, emphasizing the role of 

13 
 
root architecture, specifically aerenchyma formation, in enhancing flooding 
tolerance (Valliyodan et al., 2014). 
Despite 
these 
advances, 
significant 
gaps 
remain 
in 
understanding 
the 
comprehensive molecular and metabolic pathways that govern recovery in Solanum 
aethiopicum and other species. For instance, real-time imaging techniques for 
monitoring physiological responses during flooding have been underutilized 
(Valliyodan et al., 2014). While studies like those by Tamang and Fukao have begun 
to elucidate physiological stress responses during and post-submergence, they 
primarily focus on other crops, highlighting a lack of targeted research specifically 
on Solanum aethiopicum (Tamang & Fukao, 2015). Moreover, while key 
phytohormonal responses mediated by compounds such as ethylene have been 
identified, there is a need for specific investigations into phytohormonal cross-talk 
in Solanum aethiopicum in response to flooding (Zhao et al., 2021; , Wang & 
Komatsu, 2022). 
 
Additionally, interventions such as seed priming techniques have shown potential 
for improving resistance to flooding stress, yet their application in Solanum 
aethiopicum remains limited, indicating a substantial opportunity for enhancing 
crop resilience through such strategies (Giri et al., 2024). Recent innovations in 
high-throughput phenotyping, particularly non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) 
assessments, are paving the way for future studies on specific crop resilience 
during flooding (Brito et al., 2023). While flooding tolerance has been explored in 
various agricultural species, focused research on the specific mechanisms in 
Solanum aethiopicum genotypes is scarce, underscoring the need to further enrich 
this field. 
 
In summary, although significant progress has been made in understanding the 
physiological and biological responses of various plants to flooding stress, more 
focused research efforts on Solanum aethiopicum are necessary to address existing 
knowledge gaps and bolster the crop's agronomic performance post-flooding. 
Future studies should integrate both phenomic and genomic approaches to 
elucidate the recovery potential of this crop and promote the development of 
robust flood-tolerant varieties.

CHAPTER THREE: METHODOLOGY 
3.1 Research design  
The experiment was laid out using a randomized split plot design where the 
flooding treatment was the main plot and the three genotypes of Solanum 
aethiopicum Shum were subplots. This design ensured that Flooding stress was 
induced by submerging pots with the three Solanum aethiopicum Shum genotypes 
which are E11, E15 and E16 in water for a duration of 14 days (2wks). Plants in the 
control subplots were well watered at a 100% field capacity which was estimated 
to be 2.4L in order to maintain normal conditions. (Ezin et al., 2010).  
3.2 Area of study  
This experiment was conducted at Uganda Christian University located in Mukono 
district in central Uganda which is approximately 27km from Kampala. Mukono 
district mainly experiences two rainfall seasons and the annual rainfall received 
ranges between 1100 and 1400mm. The experiment was conducted in a screen 
house on three genotypes of Solunum aethopicum (shum) and during this period, 
the temperature in the screen house ranged from 20°c to 49°c and relative 
humidity ranging from 20% to 58%.  
3.3 Source of information  
The seeds of the three genotypes solunum aethopicum (shum) were obtained from 
the Uganda Christian University seed bank. These included E11, E15 and E16. 
3.3.1 Preparation of potting material  
The potting material used was made up of a mixture of loam soil and decomposed 
manure which was mainly chicken manure and these were mixed in the ratio 3:1. 
This means three wheel borrows of soil were mixed with 1 sack of chicken manure. 
The mixture was the placed in a sterilizing chamber that used steam to sterilize 
the soil at a temperature of 100°c for 12 hours. After the soil was fully sterilized, 
it was left to cool for 12 hour during the night. The next day, the soil was packed 
in pot of polythene and each bag received 10kgs of the mixed soil. The plots were 
spaced 45 and 15cm between and within sub-plots.  

15 
 
3.4 Raising seedlings and transplanting  
100 seeds per genotype were sown in well labelled seedling trays and were placed 
in a dark chamber with an aim of speeding up the rate of germination. Trays 
containing the seedlings were mulched and water twice a day. Trays were 
monitored daily in order to access the rate of germination and the number of 
germinated seeds was recorded daily starting from the day of emergency. After a 
period of 3 weeks, the seedlings (3 to 4 leaves) were transplanted to the 10kg 
polyethylene pots that were laid out in the screen house. During transplanting, 4g 
of NPK 17 were added to each pot to facilitate proper growth. Plants were sprayed 
weekly to prevent damage of insects, snails and others using dimethoate.  
3.5 Population and Sampling technique.   
The sample size and the total number of plants were determined by the number of 
genotypes that were used in the experiment, flooding duration, replications and 
plants per subplot. To calculate the total number of plants a formula of total plant 
per replication = (Number of genotypes) × (flooding treatment) × (plants per plot) 
was used (Blum, 2015).  
Three genotypes of solunum aethopicum (shum) were planted which were E11, E15 
and E16 to ensure diversity in recovery potential.  The flooding treatment was a 
single one uniformly applied in all subplots or experimental units. Three 
replications were made each containing four sub plots for E11, E15, E16 and one 
for the control. This is to ensured statistical strength by including three 
replications per treatment. 10 plants per genotype were planted in order to 
account for variability among individual plants. Using the calculation of total plant 
per replication = 3 genotypes × 1 flooding treatment × 10 plants per subplot = 15 
plants per replication. The total number of plants to be planted will be 30 plants 
per replication x 3 replication each containing the three genotype treatment s = 90 
plus a control unit where the flooding treatment wasn’t applied for each 
replication making it 90 plants plus 30 plant which made it 120 plants in total. The 
over roll sample size was 10 plants per genotype and in the control in every 
replication. This makes a total of 120 plants that will be subjected to data 
collection.  

16 
 
3.6 Application of floods  
Pots containing different Solunum aethopicum Shum genotypes that were still in 
their seedling stage were submerged into buckets containing water and were kept 
in the condition for 14 days while monitoring changes occurring. Plants stems 
where covered by water a type of submergence known as partial submergence. The 
water used as floods was normal clean water got from the UCU water tanks.  
3.7 Recovery phase  
After the flooding period, excess water was drained and the plants were allowed to 
recover under normal agronomic conditions. The trail was then observed for 14 
days and data was collected at weekly intervals   
3.8 Variables and indicators  
The independent variables here included:  Solunum aethopicum Shum genotypes 
and flooding stress  
The dependent variables here included:  the morphological responses which 
include plant height, new leaf count, Root length, Biomass (Dry weight) and 
Biomass (fresh weight. Physiological responses included Relative chlorophyll 
content.  
3.9 Data collection for objective one  
3.9.1 Parameters for objective one  
Before floods were applied, data on the different morphological and phyoilogical 
parameters was collect and was termed as baseline data. This was collected for 
the purpose of comparison between before and after.  
To examine the variations in recovery rates among various Solanum aethiopicum 
shum genotypes from flooding stress.  
Survival rate 
This was done by counting the number of surviving plants per genotype after the 
beginning of the recovery phase. This was followed by calculating the percentage 
of surviving plants basing on initial count. 

17 
 
Days to recovery  
This was done by monitoring and recording the number of days each plant took to 
display initial recovery signs which include the appearance of new leaves and 
reduced wilting. 
3.9.2 Parameters for objective 2 
To evaluate the agronomic performance of tolerant genotypes post- recovery 
looking at physiological and morphological changes in response to flood stress.  
New leaf count  
A count and record of the number of new leaves per plant  
Relative chlorophyll content  
Here a SPAD meter was manufactured by Konica Minolta and it was manufactured 
in 1989. It was used to measure and record chlorophyll content per plant and an 
average reading for each genotype, which reflected plant health. Relative 
chlorophyll content was measured once a week for two weeks.  
Plant height  
Here, a ruler was used to measure and record plant height from the soil surface to 
the tallest point of the plant once a week for two weeks after flooding stress and 
once at seedling stage before applying floods. 
Root length 
At the end of the recovery period, plants were uprooted and soil was carefully 
washed off from the roots and a ruler was used measure the length of the tap root   
and recorded in centimetres.  
Biomass (fresh weight) 
After harvesting each plant, soil was gently washed off each plant and the whole 
plant was weighed including leaves, stems and roots and the measurements were 
recorded in grams. 
 

18 
 
Biomass (Dry weight) 
Harvested plants were placed in an oven at 60-70°C for 48-72 hours and after  each 
plant was weighed and recorded as dry weight in grams  
Visual score  
A scale of 0-5 was used to assess and score the plant visually for damage and the 
scores were recorded basing on the criteria set out in the scoring key by 
(Sseremba, G. et al. 2018)  
3.10 Data collection instruments and equipment’s  
A measuring ruler was used to measure plant height, root length leaf width and 
length.  
A SPAD meter was used to measure and record chlorophyll content per plant.  
An oven was used for drying plants in order to obtain its dry weight.    
An Electric digital weighing scale was used to determine the fresh and dry weight 
of the plants.  
3.11 Quality and error control.  
Three replications were made in order to reduce bias on the obtained results and 
also to gain confidence in the results obtained in the first place.   
A control group was into place in order to have comparisons between the 
performance of the genotypes of Solanum aethiopicum Shum under flooding stress 
and those under normal growth conditions.  
To reduce errors, all plots were submerged equally in buckets containing water and 
every plot received the same amount water.  
3.12 Statistical data analysis  
Data collected was tested using analysis of variance to analyse the differences in 
recovery rates among the three genotypes (one-way ANOVA). Recovery indices 
were calculated basing on survival rates, biomass restoration and leaf area growth.  

19 
 
Descriptive statistics were calculated for each of the variables (means, median and 
standard deviation) 
A post- hoc test was used (turkey’s HSD for multiple comparisons) to identify the 
significant paired different between the three different genotypes.

3.14 Ethical considerations.  
Since the experiment will be conducted in the screen house under controlled 
conditions, there were no violations of ethics concerning human and animal 
wellbeing. Nevertheless providing correct data and following up the methodology 
were given high priority during the process of carrying out research.  
3.15 Anticipated methodological constraints  
Limited resources for example in setting up the controlled flooding environment 
was resource intensive, and achieving the three replications for statistical validity 
required a large area in the screen house plus the cost of labour.

The initial growth parameters of the three Solanum aethiopicum Shum genotypes 
before flooding stress application showed variable performance among the 
genotypes (Table 1). Genotype E16 demonstrated the highest mean values for most 
parameters, including plant height (7.78 ± 1.60 cm), number of leaves (9.23 ± 

21 
 
2.72), stem diameter (0.35 ± 0.13 cm), leaf area (72.70 ± 24.24 cm²), petiole 
length (2.61 ± 0.71 cm), and chlorophyll content (27.30 ± 6.92 SPAD units). 
Genotype E15 showed intermediate values for most parameters, with plant height 
of 7.63 ± 2.22 cm, leaf count of 8.60 ± 1.98, stem diameter of 0.33 ± 0.07 cm, leaf 
area of 52.49 ± 16.91 cm², petiole length of 2.17 ± 0.56 cm, and chlorophyll 
content of 24.62 ± 5.99 SPAD units. Genotype E11 consistently exhibited the lowest 
values across all parameters before flooding stress, with plant height of 6.73 ± 1.18 
cm, leaf count of 5.97 ± 0.89, stem diameter of 0.22 ± 0.05 cm, leaf area of 45.94 
± 11.96 cm², petiole length of 1.87 ± 0.43 cm, and chlorophyll content of 22.32 ± 
3.74 SPAD units. The coefficient of variation (CV) ranged from 14.61% to 36.42% 
across parameters, indicating moderate to high variability within genotypes. The 
highest variability was observed in stem diameter for E16 (CV = 36.42%), while the 
lowest variability was recorded in plant height for E11 (CV = 14.61%).

During the 14-day flooding period, all genotypes exhibited stress responses, though 
with varying degrees of severity (Table 2). Genotype E11 maintained a moderate 
plant height (16.48 ± 5.38 cm) but showed the lowest number of leaves (5.03 ± 
1.27), smallest stem diameter (5.47 ± 1.07 mm), and lowest chlorophyll content 
(32.55 ± 11.35 SPAD units). E11 also developed the fewest folded leaves (3.43 ± 

23 
 
1.01) and yellow leaves (1.03 ± 0.81), with a moderate wilting score (2.07 ± 1.17). 
Genotype E15 exhibited the shortest plant height under flooding (13.55 ± 7.51 cm), 
with intermediate values for number of leaves (7.83 ± 3.23), stem diameter (6.50 ± 
1.14 mm), and leaf area (70.51 ± 20.75 cm²). However, E15 developed the highest 
number of folded leaves (4.13 ± 1.66) and yellow leaves (1.53 ± 0.90), indicating 
greater stress sensitivity, which was further evidenced by its highest wilting score 
(2.73 ± 1.26). Genotype E16 demonstrated the most robust performance under 
flooding stress, maintaining the highest values for number of leaves (11.23 ± 5.36), 
stem diameter (7.43 ± 2.08 mm), leaf area (103.19 ± 49.20 cm²), petiole length 
(3.32 ± 1.06 cm), and chlorophyll content (38.93 ± 11.65 SPAD units). Despite these 
advantages, E16 developed similar numbers of folded leaves (3.43 ± 1.87) and 
yellow leaves (1.10 ± 0.71) as E11, with an intermediate wilting score (2.20 ± 
1.21). The coefficient of variation was particularly high for number of yellow 
leaves across all genotypes (58.49% to 78.62%), indicating substantial within-
genotype variability in this stress response parameter.

Figure 1: A graph showing number of days each genotype took to recover.  
The ANOVA results show a highly significant difference between genotypes (F = 
17.19, p < 0.0001), indicating that at least one genotype differs significantly from 
the others in terms of days to recovery. Turkey’s HSD test reveals that E15 has 
significantly longer recovery time compared to E11 (difference = 4.54 days, p < 
0.0001), E15 has significantly longer recovery time compared to E16 (difference = 
2.80 days, p = 0.0009) and the difference between E16 and E11 (1.74 days) is 
marginally significant (p = 0.0525). The coefficient of variation is highest for E15 
(43.57%), indicating more variability in recovery time for this genotype compared 
to E11 (26.96%) and E16 (32.99%). The Mean Square Error (MSE) of 9.57 represents 
the average variability within each genotype group. The Least Significant 
Difference (LSD) at α = 0.05 is 1.74 days, which represents the minimum difference 
between any two means that would be considered statistically significant. 
These results suggest that the three genotypes have different effects on recovery 
time, with E15 showing the longest average recovery period and E11 showing the 
shortest.

The ANOVA analysis shows a statistically significant difference in survival rates 
between the genotypes (F = 36.67, p < 0.0001). E11 had the highest survival rate at 
99, E15 and E16 both had identical survival rates of 96.67%. Multiple Comparisons

and E16 (difference = 2.50%, p < 0.0001) and there was no significant difference 
was found between E15 and E16 (difference = 0%, p = 1.0000) 
The genotype E11 demonstrates superior survival characteristics compared to the 
other genotypes. E15 and E16 perform identically in terms of survival rates. While

Following recovery from flooding stress, the genotypes exhibited distinct 
differences in key agronomic traits, as summarized in table2 above. Genotype E16 
recorded the tallest plants (22.48 ± 10.88 cm), while E15 had the shortest (14.34 ± 
7.58 cm). The difference was statistically significant (P = 0.0005). E16 produced 
the highest number of leaves (18.93 ± 8.73), followed by E15 and E11, with highly 
significant differences across genotypes (P < 0.0001). The thickest stems were 
observed in E16 (7.78 ± 2.21 mm), and the smallest in E11 (5.69 ± 0.95 mm) (P < 
0.0001). Genotype E16 again showed superiority, with the largest leaf area (111.29 
± 29.94 cm²), compared to E15 and E11, and the differences were highly significant 
(P < 0.0001). Although E16 showed a broader canopy (32.03 ± 6.05 cm), the 
differences among genotypes were not statistically significant (P > 0.05). E15 
produced the highest number of new leaves (18.20 ± 4.66), while E11 had the 

28 
 
lowest (4.28 ± 2.83), with highly significant variation (P < 0.0001).The Coefficient 
of Variation (CV) values indicate high variability among genotypes, especially in 
new leaf count (60.1%) and number of leaves (59.2%).

The ANOVA results show a highly significant difference in average chlorophyll 
content among the three genotypes (F = 11.68, p < 0.0001). Turkey’s test reveals 
that Genotypes E15 and E16 both have significantly higher average chlorophyll 
content than E11and There is no significant difference in average chlorophyll 
content between E15 and E16. The coefficient of variation (CV) is notably higher 
for genotype E11 (40.58%) compared to E15 (27.31%) and E16 (26.90%), indicating –
greater variability within the E11 samples. These results suggest that genotypes 
E15 and E16 produce plants with higher and more consistent chlorophyll content 
compared to genotype E11.

Figure 6: A graph showing a continuation of morphological parameters of the 
three genotypes 14 days post flooding 
The morphological performance of the three genotypes 14 days after flooding 
stress removal (Table 6) showed continuing recovery trends with some notable 
shifts. Genotype E11 demonstrated the tallest plants (35.09 ± 8.34 cm), 
significantly exceeding E16 (29.18 ± 10.90 cm) and E15 (22.79 ± 11.5 cm) (p < 

32 
 
0.0001). This represents a shift from the 7-day data, where E16 had the tallest 
plants. For leaf development, genotypes E16 (19.88 ± 8.64) and E15 (19.77 ± 6.77) 
maintained similar high leaf counts, both significantly exceeding E11 (8.28 ± 1.91) 
(p < 0.0001). Stem diameter followed the same pattern as at 7 days post-flooding, 
with E16 (7.85 ± 1.83 mm) developing the thickest stems, followed by E15 (7.12 ± 
1.33 mm) and E11 (6.45 ± 0.95 mm) (p = 0.0008). Interestingly, leaf area patterns 
changed dramatically by day 14, with E11 (163.82 ± 67.24 cm²) developing 
significantly larger leaves than both E15 (108.32 ± 26.33 cm²) and E16 (110.14 ± 
42.70 cm²) (p < 0.0001). This represents a complete reversal from the 7-day data, 
where E16 had the largest leaf area. Canopy development showed no significant 
differences among genotypes (p = 0.0655), with values of 31.98 ± 4.75 cm for E11, 
30.48 ± 7.12 cm for E16, and 28.86 ± 4.60 cm for E15. Similarly, petiole length did 
not differ significantly among genotypes (p = 0.0655), with values ranging from 
3.60 ± 0.61 cm (E15) to 4.20 ± 1.23 cm (E16). Visual recovery scores showed no 
significant differences among genotypes (p = 0.38), with values of 4.37 ± 1.07 for 
E11, 4.10 ± 1.77 for E16, and 3.83 ± 1.70 for E15, indicating similar visual recovery 
despite differences in other parameters. New leaf production remained 
significantly higher in E15 (16.23 ± 5.76) and E16 (15.12 ± 5.29) compared to E11 
(8.97 ± 4.08) (p < 0.0001), maintaining the pattern observed at 7 days post-
flooding.

both significantly higher than E11 (29.96 ± 7.85 SPAD units) (p = 0.00555). 
The LSD value of 5.05 confirms the statistical distinction between E11 and the

length was significantly different among genotypes (p = 0.0151), with E16 
developing the longest roots (16.03 ± 3.95 cm), followed by E15 (14.82 ± 2.85 cm) 
and E11 (12.18 ± 6.09 cm). Fresh weight biomass showed highly significant 
differences (p = 0.0001), with E16 accumulating the greatest biomass (48.67 ± 
14.02 g), followed by E15 (40.83 ± 6.68 g) and E11 (37.00 ± 9.27 g). Similarly, dry 
weight biomass differed significantly (p = 0.0007), with E16 (7.17 ± 1.83 g) 
accumulating the most dry matter, followed by E15 (4.83 ± 2.04 g) and E11 (4.67 ±

genotypes (p = 0.5356), with values ranging from 84.28 ± 5.87% (E16) to 88.33 ± 
2.74% (E15), indicating similar tissue water retention despite differences in 
biomass accumulation.

                                     CHAPTER FIVE:  
5.0 DISCUSSION 
5.1 Discussion for results of objective one  
5.1.1 Genotypic differences in recovery potential 
The results of this study revealed significant variations in post-flooding recovery 
potential among the three Solanum aethiopicum Shum genotypes evaluated. The 
most striking difference was observed in recovery time, where genotype E11 
demonstrated remarkably rapid recovery (5.63 days), while E15 required nearly 
two times longer (10.17 days) to show visible signs of recovery. These findings align 
with Hypothesis 1, which predicted that genotypes would exhibit differential 
recovery rates from flooding stress. 
The observed differences in recovery times can be attributed to genotype-specific 
traits that influence stress tolerance and recovery mechanisms. Similar genotypic 
variations in recovery time have been reported in other crops, such as rice (Rani et 
al., 2015) and mungbean (Islam et al., 2016), where genetic differences 
significantly influenced post-flooding recovery potential. In rice, for instance, 
certain genotypes showed rapid regrowth after de-submergence due to better 
internal oxygenation and carbohydrate reserves. 
The rapid recovery of E11 suggests that this genotype may possess efficient 
mechanisms for coping with and recovering from oxygen deprivation stress. These 
could include enhanced energy conservation during flooding, rapid restoration of 
aerobic metabolism post-flooding, or more efficient removal of toxic compounds 
accumulated during anaerobic conditions (Sasidharan et al., 2017). The remarkably 
quick recovery of E11 despite its lower pre-flooding vigor (as indicated by lower 
initial growth parameters) suggests that recovery potential is not necessarily 
correlated with initial plant vigor, but rather with specific adaptive traits for stress 
tolerance. 
The slow recovery of E15, despite its intermediate pre-flooding growth 
parameters, indicates that this genotype may lack efficient recovery mechanisms 
or may suffer more severe damage during flooding. This supports findings by Khan 

36 
 
& Malik (2022) in wheat, where flooding recovery varied among cultivars 
independent of their pre-flooding performance. Solanum aethiopicum (Shum) 
genotypes possess remarkable post-flooding recovery potential, with survival rates 
significantly exceeding initial expectations. The E11 genotype emerged as the most 
flood-tolerant, demonstrating superior recovery compared to E15 and E16 
genotypes. 
5.2 Discussion for results of objective two  
5.2.1 Physiological adaptations for flood recovery 
Chlorophyll content serves as a key indicator of physiological recovery, as it 
reflects photosynthetic capacity restoration after stress. Our results revealed that 
genotypes E15 and E16 maintained higher chlorophyll content than E11 throughout 
the recovery period, despite E11's faster visible recovery. This apparent 
contradiction suggests that different physiological mechanisms may underlie the 
recovery process in different genotypes. 
For E11, rapid visible recovery (indicated by reduced wilting and new growth) may 
be achieved through efficient water relations restoration and biomass allocation, 
even before complete photosynthetic apparatus recovery. In contrast, E15 and E16 
may prioritize physiological restoration (chlorophyll content) before investing in 
new growth. These findings align with research by Ezin et al. (2010) on tomato 
genotypes, which demonstrated that flooding tolerance and recovery involve 
complex physiological responses that vary among genotypes. 
The increase in chlorophyll content from day 7 to day 14 across all genotypes 
indicates progressive physiological recovery, with E11 showing the most substantial 
improvement (18.0% increase) compared to E15 (1.9%) and E16 (2.8%). This 
suggests that while E11 initially had lower chlorophyll content, it demonstrated 
greater potential for physiological recovery over time. This pattern supports the 
findings of Mahmood et al. (2023), who reported that flood-tolerant plants often 
show better post-flood physiological recovery despite initial stress symptoms. 

37 
 
The physiological recovery patterns observed in this study support Hypothesis 2, 
which predicted that recovered genotypes would exhibit distinct physiological 
changes in response to flooding stress. The differences in chlorophyll content 
recovery rates among genotypes suggest genotype-specific strategies for restoring 
photosynthetic capacity after flooding stress. 
5.3.2 Morphological responses and recovery mechanisms 
The morphological responses to flooding and subsequent recovery varied 
significantly among genotypes, providing insights into their recovery mechanisms. 
At 7 days post-flooding, E16 demonstrated superior performance in most 
morphological parameters, including plant height, number of leaves, stem 
diameter, and leaf area. However, by 14 days post-flooding, E11 had surpassed 
both E15 and E16 in plant height and leaf area, indicating a delayed but strong 
recovery response. 
The rapid production of new leaves by E15 and E16 compared to E11 suggests that 
these genotypes prioritize foliage regeneration as a recovery strategy. This aligns 
with research by Parad et al. (2013), who found that some plant species recover 
from flooding by rapidly producing new photosynthetic tissues. The fewer but 
larger leaves produced by E11 by day 14 suggest an alternative recovery strategy 
focused on maximizing photosynthetic area per leaf rather than leaf number. 
The root development data reveals another dimension of recovery strategies. 
Genotype E16 developed the longest roots (16.03 cm), potentially enhancing its 
ability to access water and nutrients during recovery. This likely contributed to its 
superior biomass accumulation (48.67 g fresh weight, 7.17 g dry weight). The 
shorter roots in E11 (12.18 cm) may partially explain its lower biomass 
accumulation despite its rapid initial recovery and large leaf area. These findings 
support research by Colmer & Voesenek (2009), who highlighted the importance of 
root system recovery for overall plant resilience after flooding. 
The similar water content percentages across genotypes (84.28-88.33%) despite 
differences in biomass accumulation suggest that all three genotypes successfully 
restored water relations post-flooding. This indicates that while recovery strategies 

38 
 
differed, all genotypes achieved effective water balance restoration, an essential 
aspect of post-flooding recovery. 
The morphological recovery patterns observed in this study further supports 
Hypothesis 2, demonstrating that the three genotypes employed distinct 
morphological adaptation strategies during recovery from flooding stress. 
5.4 Implications for breeding flood-tolerant varieties 
The distinct recovery patterns and mechanisms identified in this study have 
important implications for breeding flood-tolerant varieties of Solanum 
aethiopicum Shum. The rapid recovery of E11, despite its initially lower vigor, 
suggests that breeding efforts should focus on incorporating rapid recovery traits 
rather than solely selecting for vigorous growth under normal conditions. 
The superior chlorophyll retention and biomass accumulation in E16 indicate that 
this genotype possesses valuable traits for maintaining productivity after flooding 
events. The intermediate recovery time of E16 (8.88 days), combined with its 
superior final biomass, suggests that moderate recovery speed coupled with 
efficient resource allocation may be optimal for yield stability in flood-prone 
environments. 
The contrasting recovery strategies observed in the rapid visible recovery of E11 
with fewer but larger leaves versus E15 and E16's slower visible recovery with 
numerous new leaves—suggest that multiple physiological pathways contribute to 
flooding resilience. Breeding 
programs could potentially combine these 
complementary traits to develop varieties with both rapid recovery and high 
productivity post-flooding. 
The root development differences among genotypes highlight the importance of 
below-ground traits in flooding recovery. The longer roots in E16 likely contributed 
to its superior biomass accumulation, suggesting that root system architecture 
should be considered in breeding for flood tolerance. This aligns with findings by 
Bailey-Serres et al. (2012), who emphasized the role of root system plasticity in 
flood recovery. 

39 
 
Overall, this study demonstrates that different genotypes of Solanum aethiopicum 
Shum possess distinct and valuable traits for post-flooding recovery. Breeding 
programs should aim to pyramid these traits into new varieties that combine rapid 
recovery (from E11), high chlorophyll retention and new leaf production (from 
E15), and robust root development and biomass accumulation (from E16). Such 
varieties would be better equipped to maintain productivity in increasingly flood-
prone agricultural landscapes, contributing to food security in the face of climate 
change.
