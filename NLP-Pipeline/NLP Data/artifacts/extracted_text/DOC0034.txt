ABSTRACT 
In this study, evaluation of the effect of drought on germination and early seedling 
traits, targeting both released and pre-released upland rice varieties for genotype 
identification suitable to rainfed conditions in Uganda. Considering the susceptibility of 
upland rice to water stress at early growing stages, particularly in regions with low and 
erratic rainfall, this study was also designed to provide more information for breeding 
programs, as well as policies aimed at promoting robust rice cultivation in these regions. 
The study which was carried out at Uganda’s National Crops Resources Research 
Institute (NaCRRI) applied a Split Plot arrangement under a Completely Randomized 
Design evaluating fifteen rice genotypes at 5 levels of simulated drought stress using 
Polyethylene Glycol 6000 (PEG-6000) concentrations of: 0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20%. 
Germination metrics (percentage, velocity index, mean germination time, and 
synchrony) as well as early seedling parameters (shoot length, root length, fresh weight, 
dry weight, and drought injury scores) were evaluated. All germination and seedling 
performance indices were significantly reduced by increasing PEG concentrations, with 
PEG 20 having the most adverse effect on plants. Under extreme stress, the released 
varieties such as NamChe-5 had higher germination percentages (33.33%), the fastest 
mean germination time (4.88 days), the highest germination velocity index (3.28), and 
retained superior seedling dry weight (0.87 mg) and root length (2.47 cm), confirming 
its strong drought tolerance. However, some of these lines like UP-25(45) which were 
pre-released compared with released top cultivars demonstrated better performance, 
indicating their potential for varietal release in near future. While the drought-sensitive 
control IR64 demonstrated significantly lower responses in all parameters. The results 
demonstrate that early-generation screening can identify lines that outperform in 
drought environments, and pre-released genotypes offer potential for reducing yield 
losses in Uganda's rainfed upland rice production systems. It is, therefore, critical to 
incorporate early-stage drought tolerance in breeding programs for sustainable rice 
production under climate variability.

CHAPTER ONE  
 
1.1 INTRODUCTION 
1.2 BACKGROUND 
Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a very important food crop worldwide, feeding more than half 
of the global population (FAO, 2020). It becomes 50%–80% of daily energy intake for 
around 3 billion people, and an important source of several nutrients/micronutrients–
energy, fibre, proteins, vitamins (Ndikuryayo et al., 2023). Estimate data of the world 
rice production in 2019 are about 756 million metric tons cultivated in 164 million 
hectares, ranking rice as the third most produced agricultural crop after sugarcane and 
maize (Ndikuryayo et al., 2023). Africa generated about 37.9 million metric tons from 
an area of 17.2 million hectares (FAO, 2021). 
In the East Africa n region, Tanzania is leading in production and consumption, whereas 
Kenya and Uganda come in next, and all the other countries have production shortage 
and inflow of imports (Lamo et al., 2025). There are three main production systems of 
rice in Uganda, upland (rainfed), rainfed lowland and irrigated wetland; where upland 
system contributes almost 40% of the national production (Samudin 2023). Domestic 
production is about 730,000 metric tonnes but consumption is about 1,220,000 metric 
tonnes. This gap has been compensated by imports, which cost the country 
approximately USD60 million per year (FAO, 2023). The crop has showed a low yield in 
the site and, to increase local production of rice, several improved upland rice varieties 
have been released in the country including NERICA (New Rice for Africa) and “NamChe” 
varieties (Lamo et al, 2025). These cultivars have traits which make them favourable 
to farmers, namely substantially greater yields and improved stress tolerance.  
Drought stress   is an important abiotic factor limiting the production of upland rice in 
Uganda (Malemba et al., 2017) and the crop has been reported to be highly susceptible 
to water stress during early seedling development, during the vegetative stage, and at 
anthesis (reproductive) stage (Roy et al., 2021). Breeding and screening efforts so far 

2 
 
have focused on vegetative and reproductive stages, but erratic rainfall patterns are a 
reality in many locations, with frequent failures to establish successful crops due to 
inadequate rainfall (Made et al., 2022). Weakened during germination and the 
formative stage of the seedling, this vulnerability plays a significant role in the failure 
of crops (Obura & Lamo, 2024). We know that rice varieties that can withstand early 
water stress usually have better rooting systems, better osmotic adjustment, better 
water use efficiency and better activation of stress specific genes, which all of them 
lead to a vigorous crop establishment and finally high yield (Ndikuryayo et al., 2022).  
Insufficient water supplied during the seedling period, on the other hand, reduces stand 
uniformity that will cause serious yield loss (Roy et al. 2021). Thus, identification of 
these drought tolerant genotypes at these early growth stages is a valuable approach 
to improving rice production under rainfed conditions significantly (Ndikuryayo et al., 
2023) 
 
1.3 PROBLEM STATEMENT 
 
Upland rice varieties grown without irrigation are particularly susceptible to drought 
stress in the germination and early seedling stages—a sensitivity that could reduce yield 
by as much as 50% (Langangmeilu et al., 2023). As nearly 40% of Uganda's rice-growing 
area depends on rainfed agriculture, these areas are highly vulnerable to water deficit 
(Hong et al., 2021). Climate change has increased climate variability which has led to 
both severe and extreme drought periods resulting in a drop in rice production (Uganda 
Bureau of Statistics, 2023) that can indeed threaten food security in 2023. Prior efforts 
had been undertaken such as releasing drought resistant varieties like NERICA and 
agronomic improvement (Lamo et al., 2025) Nonetheless, there is a knowledge gap 
related to the germination and early seedling drought tolerance of released and pre-
release upland rice varieties as most previous work has been done on a later growth 
stage (Roy et al., 2021). Filling this gap will allow for more drought resilient 

3 
 
identification, breeding strategies, and ultimately support sustainable livelihoods for 
Ugandan rice farmers.  
 
1.4 PURPOSE OF STUDY 
Despite the above-described studies, few released, and pre-release upland rice (Oryza 
sativa L.) varieties have been evaluated with respect to their capacity for drought 
tolerance during the germination and early seedling phase to identify those with 
superior resistance. It aims also to develop essential information for breeding programs 
focused on increasing drought resistance in upland rice, which can benefit food 
security in Uganda in the long run (Domingo et al., 2023). 
 
1.5 MAIN OBJECTIVE 
The main research objective was to identify upland rice genotypes with significant 
drought tolerance that can be incorporated into breeding programs in Uganda.  
 
1.6 SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES 
1. To assess germination parameters of released and pre-released upland rice 
varieties under controlled drought conditions. 
2. To evaluate the early seedling growth parameters of the rice varieties under 
controlled drought conditions. 
 
1.7 HYPOTHESIS 
1. There is no significant difference in the germination parameters among released 
and pre-released upland rice varieties under controlled drought conditions. 
2. There is no significant difference in the early seedling growth parameters among 
released and pre-released rice varieties under controlled drought conditions.

1.8 JUSTIFICATION 
The increasing severity and frequency of droughts in Uganda pose a significant threat 
to rice production and national food security (UBOS, 2023) that makes this research 
timely and critical. As upland rice is predominantly rainfed, it is particularly vulnerable 
to erratic rainfall and extended dry periods. Choosing rice varieties tolerant to water 
deficit leading to crop establishment critical events, i.e. germination and early 
seedling development, is proposed among these success factors particularly to retain 
establishment in marginal areas with variable distribution of rainfall (Langangmeilu et 
al., 2023; Samudin, 2023). Improving tolerance to drought by this time would be a 
targeted response to impending climate pressures: If this fast-growing and faster early 
stages would be better at coping with stress later in life, they could cope with what 
lies ahead better as they grow. The initial growth response to limited water has yet to 
be fully explored, despite earlier studies that have largely concentrated on later 
developmental events (Roy et al., 2021). This study aims to bridge this gap by providing 
critical information on drought resilience in early-generation materials, which can be 
used to inform breeding and management strategies for upland rice systems exposed to 
drought. 
 
1.9 SIGNIFICANCE 
This research intends to serve several parties. Ugandan rice farmers will receive access 
to drought - resistant cultivars that improve crop establishment and grain yield under 
water-limited conditions. Using the discoveries of drought-response traits will enable 
plant-breeders to use the advanced techniques of breeding programs, he added. The 
agricultural extension services and policymakers will access evidence-based 
information for the dissemination of sustainable agricultural practices, as well as the 
academic and scientific communities through improved methodologies and deeper 

5 
 
understanding of plant stress physiology with potential applications to other crops and 
regions (Domingo  et al., 2023; Shah et al., 2024)

CHAPTER TWO 
LITERATURE REVIEW 
 
2.1 Taxonomy, Botany and Agronomic practices of Rice 
Rice is a member of the Poaceae family. Taxonomically, it belongs to Kingdom Plantae, 
Phylum Tracheophyta, Class Liliopsida, Order Poales, Family Poaceae, Genus Oryza 
(Kush 1997). Rice crops are primarily of the Oryza sativa (Asia) and Oryza glaberrima 
(West Africa) species (Zhang et al., 2022). 80% of all genetic material in Triticeae are 
common, however, which indicates that although there may be differences in genetic 
aspects, environmental adaptation, and a few aspects of agronomy, Triticeae is 
primarily grown for the grain (Zhang et al., 2022). It is characterized as an annual grass 
with a fibrous root system and long narrow leaves that are arranged alternately on a 
hollow stem (Kumar et al., 2020). The flowering structure is a terminal panicle that 
can be bearing many spikelets and each one contains one to three florets per florets 
that is self-pollinating. The edible seed vary between cultivars in shape, size, and 
quality (Samudin, 2023). 
Rice is grown in a variety of ecosystems, each necessitating specific management 
practices. They include irrigated lowland paddies, rainfed lowlands, upland (aerobic) 
fields and deep-water or flood-prone areas. Successful management of soil fertility, 
water, pests, and diseases, and better varieties through breeding are also needed for 
these environments (Shah et al., 2024). In irrigated lowlands, continuous flooding is 
kept by either continuous water supply or controlled irrigation schedules, whereas for 
upland rice, no standing water is present, which means that water conservation 
techniques and drought-resistant varieties are vital (Ndikuryayo et al., 2023). 
However, lowland rice production in Uganda and comparable tropical countries is 
focused on irrigated or wetland areas including valley bottoms or riverbanks, since 
availability of abundant water places highland rice under high plant cover and ensures 
high yield. While many cultivars of Oryza sativa do well here, high water demands, 

7 
 
costly irrigation infrastructure, soil salinity, and weed infestations in paddies present 
challenges (Zhang et al., 2023). Moreover, regular flooding can increase how much 
methane is released, causing environmental problems. Drought stress during critical 
growth stages may occur in rainfed lowland rice, which depends on the natural rainfall 
to stay flooded. 
Similarly, upland rice—grown on well-drained, non-flooded soils that are often on 
mountains and plateaus—relies entirely on rainfall and is typically grown by 
smallholder farmers as a replacement for traditional cereals. In Asian NERICAs (New 
Rice for Africa), interspecific hybrids between O. sativa and O. glaberrima, their 
genetically interrelatedness optimizes upland rice potential, combining high yield 
potential with durability and drought tolerance. Uganda, with its varied topography, 
benefits from both available NERICAs and improved upland varieties under rainfed 
production conditions that lead to high yield (Ndikuryayo et al., 2022). 
Perennial rice is a recent breakthrough production in rice cultivation. While traditional 
annual types have to be planted again every season, perennial rice grows back with the 
same root system in successive seasons, thereby lowering labour and input costs of land 
preparation and planting. Some perennial lines, derived through hybridization between 
annual rice and its wild perennial relatives, have been harvested for 4–8 consecutive 
seasons with little loss in yield, hypothesized to provide savings of up to 60% in labour 
and requiring less seed and fertilizer (Zhang et al., 2023). Uganda is testing perennial 
rice varieties on an experimental basis, which may provide the added benefit of saving 
labour while also improving the health of the soil by maintaining continuous ground 
cover. When the climate is changing at an unprecedented pace, the addition of 
innovations perennially in rice, along with improved agronomic practices, becomes 
essential to ensure food security and environmental resilience, notwithstanding the 
threats made by broad seating, disease resistance, and competitive performance. 
Two cultivars of NamChe, developed through national breeding programs with support 
from AfricaRice, are widely grown in Northern Uganda with yields ranging from 3000–
4000 kg/ha under rainfed upland production systems (Hong et al., 2021). They are 

8 
 
appreciated for their drought tolerance, yield potential, and mild aroma suitable for 
local market demands (Hong et al., 2021). On the other hand, some NERICA varieties 
have good drought resistance, whereas others are sensitive to stress and susceptible 
to foliar diseases. The accuracies of both released and emerging cultivars are still 
carried out for the farmers for high yielding, drought resistant options. 
Ongoing challenges to rice production such as water scarcity, irregular rainfall, 
declining soil fertility, and pest and disease pressures have spurred the development of 
integrated management and breeding innovations. To mitigate these problems, better 
water management practices like controlled irrigation and soil moisture conservation, 
as well as nutrient management implementing the use of organic amendments and 
targeted fertiliser regimes have been adopted (Shah et al., 2024). Simultaneously, 
NERICA and NamChe series-focused breeding programs for drought-tolerant and 
disease-resistant cultivars have substantially improved crop adaptability under harsh 
conditions (Hong et al., 2021; Ndikuryayo et al., 2022).  
 
2.2 Drought Stress and Its Effects on Upland rice 
However, lack of water at germination and early seedling establishment competes for 
crop establishment and subsequently leads to the full establishment of the yield. 
Drought impedes key physiological processes ranging from water uptake and cell 
division to metabolism that lead to morphological differences like delayed or reduced 
germination, stunted growth in seedlings, and decreased accumulation of biomass 
(Dong et al., 2025). Such as a deficit of water can negatively impact on seed imbibition, 
resulting in ineffectiveness germination and inconsistency emergence (Hem et al., 
2021). In the seedling phase, the shortage of water reduces cell extension and growth 
resulting in reduced shoots and root, smaller leaf area and reduced photosynthetic 
capacity. Also, decreased transpiration in such conditions would negatively impact 
nutrient uptake, adding another layer of growth limitation (Made et al., 2022). In 

9 
 
severe situations, drought after germination can lead to seedling death, threatening 
stand establishment. 
In upland rice systems where fields are not intentionally flooded maintaining sufficient 
soil moisture is an ongoing struggle. Even short dry periods can be stressful, with lasting 
impacts that contribute to incomplete recovery when it rains again. The yield 
reductions due to drought can differ significantly depending on the severity and 
duration of the stress and might range from 30% to 80%. Upland rice varieties, such as 
some of the select NERICAs, or improved lines developed in-country with inherent 
drought tolerance (Lamo et al., 2025; Ndikuryayo et al., 2023), suffer less from stress 
than do the sensitive lines—experiencing yield reductions of approximately 20–40% 
under stress (vs yield reductions > 60% for sensitive lines) (Ndikuryayo et al., 2022). 
For example, climate studies in East Africa have found that early-season drought stress 
can reduce yields of moderately tolerant genotypes by 35–50% and of highly susceptible 
ones by more than 70%. 
Rice plants also have mechanisms to resist drought at the cellular level. The main 
response involved is osmolyte accumulation, for example proline, soluble sugars, 
glycine betaine, which serves to maintain turgor by reducing osmotic potential and 
protecting cellular structure (Dong et al., 2025). Also, rice boosts its antioxidative 
protectors by increasing the levels of the enzyme’s superoxide dismutase, catalase, and 
peroxidases that diminish the harm by the reactive oxygen species produced under 
stress (Dong et al., 2025; Nagai et al., 2024). Phytohormone alterations, especially 
elevated levels of abscisic acid (ABA), induce stomatal closure to reduce water loss 
and stimulate stress-responsive genes. Changes in membrane lipid composition also 
help stabilize cell membranes under drought stress (Dong et al., 2025). 
Morphological adaptations are another important aspect in drought tolerance and it 
plays a pivotal role. The extensive root system, for instance, allows upland rice 
genotypes to access moisture from deeper soil layers in dryland environments, where 
the topsoil dries quickly (Zheng, 2025) rules. Drought tolerance in rice is a complex 
trait that includes efficient water uptake, conservative water use, osmotic adjustment, 

10 
 
reactive oxygen species detoxification, hormonal regulation, and growth plasticity 
(Zheng, 2025). It is hence critical to evaluate drought tolerance during germination and 
early seedling growth, as failure to establish in these life stages can preclude 
successful establishment of the crop (Dong et al., 2025). 
Morpho-physiological indices including germination percentage, Germination Velocity 
Index (GVI), seedling shoot and root lengths and biomass accumulation, are employed 
in quantifying drought responses (Nagai et al., 2024). For example, one can compute a 
drought susceptibility index by comparing germination percentages under varying levels 
of stress and those under optimal conditions, while a high GVI under drought suggests 
a rapid and robust germination response to the limitations imposed by water availability 
(Islam et al., 2018). The plant is incapable of recovering its total number of tillers and 
biomass after just a short period of drought lasting of 10–14 days after sowing which 
has been demonstrated to cause large concomitant declines in yield (Ndikuryayo et al., 
2022). By contrast, some varieties escape drought damage by entering a quiescent state 
during early stress, allowing them to mend rapidly in the event of a moisture pulse. 
 
2.3 Polyethylene Glycol Induced Osmotic Stress 
Simulating Controlled drought conditions that mimic drought stress allow us to better 
understand plant responses to abiotic stress in much more detail compared to in-field 
studies, enable screening of large numbers of genotypes so that genotypes with more 
drought-tolerant traits can be selected (Kadir et al. 2023). One common approach for 
this is the induction of osmotic stress via polyethylene glycol (PEG). Poly Ethylene 
Glycol (PEG) acting as an inert polymer with high molar mass contents when they 
dissolve in water, the result of this solvent-attached dry state, in fact, declines the 
solution's water potential, for example, drought stress applied without toxicity reaction 
since it could not be taken up by the plants due to its high molecular weight such that 
the PEG entry into plants is significantly lower than the water (Islam et al., 2018; Made 
et al., 2022). 

11 
 
Peg-induced stress for inducing appearance of autophagy. These can be done easily in 
petri dishes, germination trays or hydroponic systems, where equal stress conditions 
can be provided across all samples (Purbajanti et al., 2019). The ability to fine-tune 
the PEG concentration allows researchers to establish a desired osmotic potential (e.g., 
−0.5 MPa to replicate moderate drought), something that is difficult to accomplish in 
field conditions because of soil heterogeneity and weather changes. PEG enables high-
throughput screening of many genotypes under uniformly controlled conditions, making 
it a valuable tool for early-generation selection in breeding programs (Goraguddi et al., 
2023). 
However, PEG-induced stress does not accurately reflect the complex nature of field 
drought in which water deficits emerge gradually and are dependent on soil properties 
and microenvironmental conditions. Although PEG treatments are most effective 
during early growth stages, PEG is less appropriate for mimicking drought during later 
developmental periods. In fact, natural drought is a complex of wet periods to dry and 
re-wet cycles, which only cause relative stress unlike PEG, which applies continuous 
stress. Nevertheless, data demonstrates that genotypes of rice with good performance 
in PEG-induced stress also establish better under field conditions that include dry 
sowing (Purbajanti et al., 2019). 
PEG-induced osmotic stress will be applied in this experimentation to simulate drought 
during germination and early seedling growth. Utilized known concentrations (additive 
of 15% or 20% PEG-6000) will be used for consistent water stress environment. Seeds 
will be placed on damp filter paper or onto agar media, saturated the with PEG solution 
or water (the control), and the differences in germination rates recorded 
systematically (Goraguddi et al., 2023). Likewise, young seedlings will be grown in 
nutrient solutions with PEG and measured for root and shoot growth. PEG-mediated 
osmotic stress, in conjunction with other screening techniques serves as a quick and 
reproducible method to determine the drought tolerance profiles of genotypes 
(Gaurana-Nuñez, 2024). 
 

12 
 
2.4 Visual Scoring 
Visual scoring Visual scoring allows a rapid and qualitative measure of plant response 
to drought through the study of the expressed symptoms. Drought stress symptoms in 
rice and other crops are normally characterized by rolling, drying, wilting of leaves, 
and general reduction in vigour and greenness (Islam et al., 2018). The International 
Rice Research Institute (IRRI) has developed a Standard Evaluation System (SES) that 
employs a numerical scale (generally from 0 to 9), with lower values reflecting few 
symptoms and higher numbers indicating more intense stress. 
Drought stress is monitored periodically from visual assessments under controlled 
conditions. For instance, during the seedling stage, leaf rolling may be rated from 1 
(fully turgid, no rolling) to 5 (full rolling). Leaf drying usually is expressed either as 
proportion of affected area or categorical score with respect to degree of dehydration. 
While wilting is more subjectively scored by the loss of turgor, visual scoring can be 
particularly advantageous in field trials where complex measurements such as direct 
water potential are impractical. As it is a qualitative subject, these evaluations require 
standardization with appropriate training and reference images (Islam et al., 2018). 
Today, computer vision and machine learning methods are widely used to complement 
traditional visual scoring through conversion of digitalised images of tissues into 
quantitative stress parameters. The shifts in leaf colour, angles and overall plant size 
can be quantitatively assessed and converted into stress scores. Although moderate 
responses, such as leaf rolling, can be adaptive, nuanced responses (e.g. severe leaf 
drying) indicate damage, so visual scoring systems usually give special emphasis to 
stress-indicating symptoms (Awasthi et al., 2019). 
 
2.5 Drought Tolerance Mechanisms in Upland rice 
Upland rice genotypes possess several adaptive mechanisms to cope with the water-
limited conditions. Full elucidation of these mechanisms is important for breeding 

13 
 
programs that want to enhance drought tolerance (Ndikuryayo et al., 2023; Shah et al., 
2024). For dry conditions, there are broad plant responses that include traits of escape, 
avoidance, tolerance, and recovery, and the range is primarily focused on avoidance 
and within-tolerance mechanisms for upland rice. 
On the level of morphology, crucial traits in drought avoidance are the development of 
a deep root system. Drought-tolerant varieties of rice typically develop larger and 
deeper root systems, enabling access to moisture in subsoil layers—an important trait 
for crops in upland settings, where soil at the surface can dry out quickly (Zheng, 2025). 
Stomatal regulation is also important; drought-tolerant plants tend to close stomata 
earlier or more effectively to minimize water loss at the expense of replication 
(growth) and photosynthesis (Kadir et al., 2023). Osmotic adjustment, which is driven 
by osmolyte accumulation, e.g. proline and soluble sugars, assists in retaining water 
and maintaining turgor in cells at low external water potential (Made et al., 2022).  
At both the biochemical and molecular levels, rice activates numerous drought-
responsive genes and pathways. Hormonal signals, especially in the case of abscisic acid 
(ABA), and the involvement of transcription factors like DREB are crucial in controlling 
these responses. Aquaporins, which facilitate water transport, and protective proteins, 
such as late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins, also help cells be more resilient. 
Upregulation of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase and catalase also 
counters oxidative stress (Aggarwal et al., 2025; Dong et al., 2025). New strategies, 
including seed priming and leaf-plication of silicon or silica nanoparticles are effective 
for inducing drought tolerance by modulating redox signalling and fortifying cell walls 
(Kang et al., 2025). 
Several QTL mappings and genome-wide association studies have demonstrated the 
first identified regions in the rice genome that contribute to drought tolerance. 
Importantly, the QTLs like the qDTY loci have been introgressed into popular cultivars, 
improving drought performance without sacrificing yields under favourable conditions 
(Srividya et al., 2011). NERICA varieties are a great example of how genetic diversity is 
put to good use, leading to the combining of advantageous traits of both O. sativa and 

14 
 
O. glaberrima leading to early vigour, competitive ability against weeds and superior 
drought resilience. Another important trait seen in some tolerant genotypes was the 
ability to recover from drought after plants can grow new leaves once the stress is 
removed (Kadir et al., 2023). 
 
2.6 Strategies for incorporating drought tolerance into rice breeding programs 
Drought tolerance, especially for upland rice systems, is a major target of breeding 
programs aimed at rainfed ecosystems. Divergent approaches are used to introduce 
drought-resilient traits into new rice varieties. Dedicated methods, including 
laboratory germination assays utilizing PEG-induced stress and seedling vigour testing 
under unirrigated conditions, have been established to identify cultivars that can 
quickly and robustly take their establishment under early drought conditions (Siddique 
et al., 2023). These approaches seek to maintain stable yield with minimal trade-offs 
such as low yield under optimal conditions; for example, the drought susceptibility 
index (DSI) is an indicator commonly used by breeders when selecting for lines 
associated with minimal yield loss under stress. 
Aspects of these strategies are supported through collaborative work on the 
international stage, which encompasses organizations such as IRRI and AfricaRice that 
can promote sharing of promising germplasm and multi-location testing. Such 
partnerships are vital to developing climate-resilient rice varieties — a requirement for 
global food security as the threat of water scarcity looms (Ndikuryayo et al., 2023). 
Drought tolerance improvement in rice through breeding is complex but still feasible 
by taking advantage of traditional and novel genomic and phenotyping technologies. 
Diverse germplasm was evaluated, hybridization strategies, marker-assisted selection 
and genomic selection were employed, biotechnological advances were made, and 
participatory breeding approaches were adopted in the development of drought 
resistant upland rice with yield stability. This work, and its extensive testing in the 

15 
 
field, has far reaching consequences in that it helps separate genetic make-up from the 
response of a plant to its environment, providing greater assurance that rice, the staple 
most consumed by hundreds of millions, remains dependable and productive in regions 
that are likely to experience ever-water-scarcer conditions (Ambikabathy et al., 2019).

CHAPTER THREE 
METHODOLOGY 
 
3.1 Study 1: Effect of drought on germination rates of the upland rice varieties. 
3.1.1 Study location 
The experiment was done in a seed laboratory of NaCRRI located at Namulonge, Wakiso 
District approximately 25 km northwest of Kampala. Namulonge is located within 
Uganda’s central Agro-ecological zone, which is characterized by tropical, equatorial 
climatic conditions with bimodal rainfall and an annual average precipitation of 
between 1,000 and 1,500 mm. The region’s typical temperature of 20°C to 28°C and 
environmental context found in the laboratory under a more controlled condition 
provide the relevant field condition under which upland rice is grown and therefore, 
the significance and applicability of the experimental results to the agronomic practices 
found in Uganda. 
 
3.1.2 Planting materials 
The study will use fifteen rice genotypes that will be sourced from the rice breeding 
program at National Crops Resources Research Institute (NaCRRI). The seeds we 
harvested in January 2025 and stored at a temperature of 40C in the Cereals seed bank. 
The experiment has a susceptible check which is IR64 (Cruz et al., 2018). Within the 
NERICA series, NERICA-4 (released in 2002) is recognised for its early vigor and stable 
yield under rainfed conditions, establishing it as a benchmark for upland performance 
(Somado et al., 2008). NERICA-1 and NERICA-10, introduced in 2007, share a number of 
traits yet display subtle differences in maturation and stress adaptability (Somado et 
al., 2008). NERICA-6, released in 2014, has attracted attention for its superior grain 
quality and competitive biomass production under stress conditions. The NARIC series—
comprising NARIC-1 and NARIC-2, released in 2002- exhibit intermediate drought 
tolerance with moderate biomass accumulation. The NamChe group, consisting of five 
varieties (NamChe-1 through NamChe-5) developed via marker-assisted selection at 

17 
 
NaCRRI and released in 2013, underscores the diversity of adaptive traits. NamChe-5 
exhibits a superior root system under drought stress, while NamChe-1 and NamChe-4 
maintain moderate tolerance and consistent seedling vigour (Hong et al., 2021). In 
contrast, the IR64 variety, representing lowland rice, is a susceptible check due to its 
poor performance under drought stress despite its high-yield potential in irrigated 
systems (Cruz et al., 2018). The Pre-released from NaCRRI, 18(18)G, UP-15(45), and UP-
25(45) demonstrate promising germination rates, early growth stability, and visual 
indicators of stress tolerance, with UP-25(45) 
 
 
3.1.3 Experimental design 
The design arrangement of the study was Split Plot arrangement in Completely 
Randomized. It allows for the two independent variables to be tested within this 
experiment. The primary independent variable (main plot) was Polyethylene glycol 
6000 (PEG-6000) in various concentrations. The adding subplots were the 15 rice 
varieties stated in 3.1. It had been repeated three times. The PEG-6000 concentrations 
were prepared as i.e.  0% (control), 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% by dissolving stipulated 
amounts of polyethylene glycol 6000 in 100ml of distilled water (Goraguddi et al., 2023). 
Rice Seeds were sterilized by soaking in a 70% ethanol solution for 2 minutes followed 
by distilled water rinse. 10 millilitres of the different PEG-6000 concentrations was 
added to 10-cm sterile Petri dishes lined with two layers of Whatman paper, and 50 
seeds from each genotype were placed in these dishes. The set-up was maintained in a 
plant growth chamber at a constant temperature of 25±0.5°C and relative humidity of 
80±1% for 7 days on Petri dishes (Islam et al., 2018).

3.1.4 Data collection 
Seed were considered germinated with radicle protrusion of more than 2 mm, and 
germination count was done after every 24 hours. Germination percentage, 
Germination Velocity Index and Mean Germination Time were calculated using the 
formulas below.

Where T is the mean germination time, Ti is the time from the start of the experiment 
to the ith interval, Ni is the number of seeds germinated in the ith time interval and k 
is the total number of time intervals (Bore et al. 2023). 
 
3.1.5 Data Analysis 
Data analysis was performed using R 4.4.3 and Microsoft Excel 365. Descriptive statistics 
included mean, standard deviation, and median. Two-way ANOVA was conducted to 
assess effects of genotype (G), PEG concentration (P), and their interaction (G × P). 

19 
 
LSD test at p < 0.05 determined significance. Shapiro-Wilk and Levene’s tests verified 
assumptions of normality and variance homogeneity (Karanjit et al., 2024). 
 
3.2 Study 2: Effect of drought on early seedling stage of the upland rice varieties. 
3.2.1 Study location 
The experiment was conducted in the seed laboratory at National Crops Resources 
Research Institute (NaCRRI) in Namulonge, Wakiso district in Uganda. (3.1.1) 
3.2.2 Planting materials 
The study used fifteen rice genotypes that were sourced from the rice breeding program 
at National Crops Resources Research Institute (NaCRRI). The same upland rice varieties 
in 3.1.2 were used materials were used in 3.1.2. 
3.2.3 Experimental design 
The study used Split Plot design in Completely Randomized design. The main plot was 
Polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG-6000) of different concentrations. The subplot was rice 
varieties stated in 3.1. The layout was replicated three times.  Polyethylene glycol 6000 
concentrations. Rice Seeds were surface sterilized with a 70% ethanol solution for 2 
minutes and rinsed with distilled water. Fifty seeds from each genotype were placed in 
sterilized Petri dishes lined with two layers of Whatman paper and moistened with 10 
ml of the specified concentration of PEG-6000 solution (Sharma, P., & Kumar, S. 2023). 
Two hundred twenty five Petri dishes were incubated in a growth chamber at a constant 
temperature of 25±0.5°C and relative humidity of 80±1% (Islam et al., 2018). The 
experiment was extended to 14 days to assess seedling responses (Samudin, 2023). The 
experimental design was the same as that in 3.1.3. 
3.2.4 Data collection 
On the 14th day, seedling parameters were measured under controlled conditions to 
evaluate the impact of drought stress. 15 seedlings were sampled from each 
experimental unit. Seedling length (from root tip to shoot tip) was recorded using a 
foot ruler. The fresh weight of the seedlings was also taken using an analytical weighing 

20 
 
scale (MODEL SPX222). Biomass accumulation was quantified by drying 15 seedlings from 
each experimental unit in a laboratory oven (Model EDS-LE-10931) for 48 hours at 70°C.  
Drought score was assessed visually through the Standard Evaluation System (SES) for 
rice developed by the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI et al., 2021) (IRRI, 
2021) (see Appendix Table 12). Drought stress symptoms on seedlings were rated on a 
scale of 0(no visible symptoms) to 9(complete death of seedlings) according to the SES 
score. Medium scores correlate with leaf rolling and tip drying. For example, a score 
of 1 means a little rolling and drying, while a 5 means half the leaves are brown, dry 
and fully rolled. Seedlings showing total desiccation and death receive the highest 
score (9). Again, this visual scoring protocol permitted rapid, standardized assessment 
of physiological drought responses in plants and was well suited to complement 
quantitative data, such as seedling biomass and elongation metrics collected during the 
trial. 
 
 
 
3.2.5 Data Analysis 
 
Data analysis was similar to that of Study 1. Two-way ANOVA was used to determine 
main and interaction effects. Data were visualized using Excel 365 charts. LSD (p < 
0.05) determined differences among means.

Chapter 4 
Results 
This chapter explains the performance of both established and candidate upland rice 
cultivars when subjected to varying intensities of PEG-induced drought stress—from a 
control condition (0% PEG) to severe stress (20% PEG). Nine critical parameters were 
examined to compare the released cultivars with pre-released lines (18(18)G, UP-15(45), 
UP-25(45)) and a drought-sensitive check (IR64).  
4.1 Mean Germination Time (MGT) 
 
MGT, which indicates the speed of seed germination (with lower values denoting faster 
germination) as shown in Table 3 below, was similar across all genotypes under control 
conditions (PEG 0), averaging around 5 days. Minor variations were observed; for 
example, NamChe-5 recorded the fastest germination at approximately 4.9 days, while 
NARIC-1 was slower at around 5.5 days. IR64, with an MGT of about 5.3 days, 
demonstrated moderate germination speed in comparison. Under severe drought (PEG 
20), germination was generally delayed, leading to increased MGT values, though the 
degree of delay varied. Some released and pre-released lines, such as UP-25(45) which 
shifted marginally from 5.26 to 5.31 days and NERICA-10 from 5.33 to 5.31 days, 
maintained nearly consistent MGT values under stress.

highest GP at 86%, while IR64 recorded the lowest at 74%. Most released upland varieties 
including the NamChe, NERICA, and NARIC series surpassed 80% GP under optimal 
conditions, and the pre-released lines were comparably around 79–81%, indicating high 
seed viability generally. Under severe drought (PEG 20), all genotypes experienced 
significant declines in GP. IR64 was most affected, reduced to 12.7% implying that nearly 
nine out of ten seeds failed to germinate under stress. While the other varieties-
maintained GP values between 20% and 33%.

4.3 Germination Velocity Index (GVI) 
GVI combines germination speed and uniformity, reflecting early vigour as shown in 
Table 5. NamChe-5 dominated across all stress levels—from 9.90 under PEG 0 to 3.28 at 
PEG 20. NERICA-6 and NERICA-4 also showed robust values under low to moderate stress, 
maintaining GVI above 5.5 up to PEG 10. IR64's GVI fell drastically to 1.39 at PEG 20%, 
confirming its sluggish and inconsistent germination. The slow decline of GVI in UP-
15(45), NamChe-2, and NARIC-1 suggests their seeds maintain metabolic activity longer 
under dehydration stress. While PEG 0 levels showed a clustered performance, drought 
stress clearly separated the high-performing upland genotypes from the vulnerable IR64.

4.4 Germination Synchrony 
Synchrony reflects how uniform germination is within a population; values close to 0.18 
signify tight clustering of emergence. From Table 6 below, at PEG 0%, NamChe-1 had 
the highest synchrony (0.180), indicating highly synchronized germination. Under stress, 
some varieties like NARIC-2 saw increased synchrony (0.207 at PEG 15), possibly due to 
fewer but more coordinated germination events. In contrast, IR64 dropped significantly 
to 0.067 at PEG 20%, suggesting disorganized, staggered germination. NamChe-5 and 

26 
 
NamChe-3 consistently sustained higher synchrony under stress, which is desirable for 
uniform crop establishment.

4.5 Seedling Drought Stress Score 
This score quantifies visible drought symptoms, with higher values indicating greater 
injury as shown in Table 7 below. IR64 had the worst scores across all PEG levels, rising 
from 1.33 at PEG 0 to 8.04 at PEG 20—nearly complete damage. Conversely, upland 
varieties had low scores under control (e.g., NERICA-4 at 0.20) and moderate increases 
under stress. Notably, UP-15(45), UP-25(45), and NamChe-5 all scored below 5.5 at PEG 
15, and under 7.3 at PEG 20, outperforming IR64. This confirms visual tolerance and 
health under limited water.

4.6 Seedling Fresh Weight 
Seedling fresh weight as shown in Table 8, was measured before drying. Under control 
conditions (PEG 0), upland cultivars accumulated substantial biomass—several lines 
recorded values between 54 and 57 mg per seedling like NamChe-4 at 56.7 mg, NARIC-
2 at 55.9 mg, and NamChe-1 at 55.1 mg whereas IR64 had a lower fresh weight of 
approximately 45.7 mg. Under severe drought (PEG 20), fresh weight declined 
dramatically for all genotypes; seedlings that typically weighed between 50 and 56 mg 
under optimal conditions were reduced to about 1–2 mg, corresponding to a reduction 
of roughly 96–98%.

4.7 Seedling Dry Weight 
Seedling dry weight as shown in Table 9, representing the biomass after drying (and 
thus the accumulated solids), reflected the trends observed for fresh weight. Under 
control conditions (PEG 0), upland varieties produced approximately 10–11 mg of dry 
matter per seedling, in contrast to IR64, which produced about 8.8 mg. Under 20% PEG, 
dry weight nearly collapsed for all genotypes. The coefficient of variation was less than 
10% which showed that the data was reliable. Upland varieties retained between 0.8 
and 0.95 mg of dry weight, while IR64’s seedlings dropped to around 0.54 mg. 
Consequently, IR64 experienced a biomass reduction of roughly 94%, compared to a 90–
93% reduction in the upland lines. Statistically, IR64’s dry weight under stress was 
significantly lower than that of the upland cultivars.

4.8 Seedling Root Length 
Root length is a vital indicator of drought tolerance, as longer roots may access moisture 
from deeper soil layers. As shown in Table 10, under control conditions (PEG 0), upland 
cultivars developed substantial root systems, with lengths typically ranging from 8.0 to 
8.3 cm. For instance, NamChe-5 exhibited roots of approximately 8.31 cm, while 
several other upland varieties (e.g., NamChe-2, UP-15(45), NARIC-1) ranged from 8.1 
to 8.3 cm, and NamChe-1 slightly less at 7.97 cm. IR64, however, developed 
significantly shorter roots (around 7.03 cm), placing it in a lower statistical category. 

31 
 
Under severe drought (PEG 20), root elongation was considerably hindered across all 
genotypes; while upland cultivars maintained a relative advantage, with most recording 
root lengths between 2.3 and 2.5 cm (NamChe-5 at 2.47 cm and UP-15(45) at 2.40 cm). 
In contrast, IR64’s roots averaged only about 1.53 cm, roughly half the length of those 
in drought-tolerant lines.

4.9 Total Seedling Length (Shoot + Root Length) 
Table 11 that shows Total seedling length which combines shoot and root lengths, 
provides measure of early seedling development. Under control conditions (PEG 0), 
upland varieties exhibited total seedling lengths between approximately 11.6 and 12.4 
cm, reflecting growth. At PEG 0, NamChe-5 and NERICA-6 again topped performance 
(>12 cm), while IR64 was consistently the shortest. Under PEG 20, NamChe and UP lines 
managed ~4.5–5 cm, whereas IR64 was reduced to barely 3 cm. For example, UP-15 
achieved a total length of 12.43 cm, and 18(18)G measured 12.37 cm, while other 
varieties such as NERICA-10, NERICA-1, UP-25(45), NamChe-5, NamChe-4, and NERICA-
4 clustered around 12.0–12.2 cm. IR64, consistently underperformed in this parameter. 
These differences indicate stronger initial establishment potential among upland 
varieties.

Chapter 5 
The discussion is structured along important parameters, comparing the performance 
of released and unreleased upland varieties and situating the results in relation to other 
research papers. 
5.1 Discussion for objective 1 - To assess germination parameters of released and pre-
released upland rice varieties under controlled drought conditions. 
One of the most sensitive parameters to this stress is the final germination percentage 
(GP) across rice genotypes, indicating the effects of drought stress on germination 
characteristics by polyethylene glycol (PEG) treatment. Under the same well-watered 
conditions, GP is generally greater than 80% in GP-susceptible genotypes, yet exposure 
to 20% PEG caused GP to drop significantly to 25–30% in drought-tolerant hotspots and 
even to 12–13% in the sensitive IR64 genotype, in agreement with findings of  Islam et 
al. (2018) and (Siddique et al., 2023), who highlighted rice's susceptibility during 
germination. This trend is consistent with (Sagar et al., 2020), who reported sudden 
collapses in GP with increasing PEG-induced osmotic stress (–0.9 MPa). Among 210 rice 
accessions evaluated by (Fontonah et al., 2023) PEG stress, GP under PEG stress range 
was wide, with some lines maintaining approximately 50% GP while others showed near 
complete failure (Siddique et al., 2024). This variability emphasizes the genetic 
diversity in response to drought stress as illustrated by comparing the performance gap 
in NamChe-5 (≈33% GP) and IR64 (≈12–13% GP) and further accentuates the degree of 
susceptibility of IR64.  
Although not specified in some of the datasets, germination vigour and germination 
vigour index (GVI) demonstrated similar trends; PEG stress significantly reduced GVI 
especially in susceptible genotypes by reducing the rate and synchronicity with which 
germination occurred. Kawaguchi et al. (2023) provide evidence that drought-tolerant 
lines have higher GVI under drought-induced stress, indicating that rapid early 

35 
 
metabolic activation occurs in a water deficit condition and is therefore plastic. Finally, 
germination uniformity, often the silent villain in literature, is paramount for field 
establishment. Germination dynamics were highly erratic for IR64 at under 20% PEG, 
which was in marked contrast to the more synchronized emergence in upland varieties. 
The consistent responses of the drought tolerant lines may harmonize due to similar 
regulation of hormonal signalling pathways, for example, abscisic acid signalling (as 
demonstrated by (Evamoni et al, 2023), emphasizing the future exploration of genetic 
and physiologic basis of uniformity under similar stress conditions. 
 
5.2 Discussion for objective 2 - To evaluate the early seedling growth parameters of 
the rice varieties under controlled drought conditions. 
 
As shown in the PEG-induced drought visual scoring of other genotypes (Pope et al., 
2024; Samudin, 2023), the stress response upon drought showed highly significant 
genotypic variation, where sensitive cultivars such as IR64 infected consistently scored 
above 8 levels (IRRI∼≤ 8 levels aligned with near-lethal stress), whereas moderately 
resilient genotypes including NERICA-4 and NamChe-4 scored much less (around stress 
scores of 6.8). PEG stress significantly inhibited biomass accumulation, with reductions 
in fresh and dry seedling weight of up to 95% in some genotypes. This correlates 
(Sobahan et al., 2022), who explained the biomass decline under 20% PEG by impaired 
cell expansion and photosynthesis because of limited water uptake. Root analysis also 
exposed significant differences; NamChe-5/PEG, a drought-tolerant line under PEG 
stress maintained longer root systems than IR64 which reflects higher capacity of water 
foraging ability. This observation is in contrast to the findings of (Sathyabharathi  et 
al., 2022), rooted in that landraces can maintain root elongation under this osmotic 
stress due to their innate tolerance to drought. In contrast, shoot length decreased 
across all genotypes, highlighting the strong effect that drought imposed on 
aboveground growth.

There were differences in germination metrics, biomass traits, or morphological 
resilience when comparing released and pre-released genotypes. The promising pre-
released lines (UP-15(45) and UP-25(45)) out yielded in terms of average performance 
elite lines, NERICA-4 and NamChe-5 (56.02-37.52%) suggest that drought-resisting 
alleles has been introgressed into newly bred materials. That development reflects 
(Pavithran et al., 2024), demonstrating that backcrossed inbred lines enriched for 
drought QTLs had strong early-stage drought tolerance. In addition, the consistency of 
NERICA-4 performance across various African upland environments (Wade et al., 2019), 
confirming its reliability, and the capabilities of UP-15(45) and related lines to serve 
as next generation, farmer-preferred, drought-adapted cultivars with enhanced 
agronomic traits.

6.1 Conclusion 
The results showed that drought significantly reduced germination and seedling 
performance across all varieties, but with notable differences in tolerance. NamChe-5 
consistently outperformed all others, demonstrating the highest germination 
percentage (64.67% at PEG 10%, 33.33% at PEG 20%), fastest germination speed (MGT 
of 4.88 days), highest GVI (9.90 at PEG 0), and superior biomass retention under stress. 
Pre-released lines like UP-25(45) and UP-15(45) also showed strong performance, 
comparable to and sometimes better than some released varieties, especially in 
maintaining root length, seedling mass, and visual drought resilience under severe 
stress levels. 
The statistical analysis confirmed these trends, leading to the rejection of Hypothesis 
H1, as significant differences were observed among genotypes in germination 
performance under drought. Similarly, Hypothesis H2 was rejected, showing that early 
seedling growth responses also significantly varied between released and pre-released 
lines. These findings highlight the existence of considerable genetic variability that can 
be exploited in breeding programs. The drought-susceptible check IR64 performed 
poorest, validating its use as a sensitive control. The study identifies NamChe-5 and UP-
25(45) as strong candidates for varietal promotion and breeding, offering a pathway to 
improve

6.2 Recommendations 
These findings highlight the promise of both released and pre-released upland rice 
varieties for sustainable crop establishment in water-limited environments, offering a 
viable strategy for reducing drought-induced yield losses and improving food security 
in drought-affected areas. And suggest more studies are carried out in-field for 
germination and early seedling. I suggest repeating the research from germination and 

38 
 
early seedlings under drought stress conditions to maturity and yield to determine the 
impact early drought stress had on yield.
