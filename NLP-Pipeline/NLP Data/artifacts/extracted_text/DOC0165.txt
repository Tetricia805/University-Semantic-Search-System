ONLINE CRIME REPORTING MANAGEMENT 
SYSTEM  PROJECT PROPOSAL 
 
 
CHAPTER ONE 
 
 
 
Chapter One of this project present the background information to the study highlighting the 
problem statement, objectives, scope and significance to the study. 
•  
•  1.1 Background to the study  
In Mbale City, Uganda, the current approach to crime reporting and management is predominantly 
manual, which has resulted in significant inefficiencies. Citizens must physically visit police 
stations to report crimes, leading to long queues, delays in filing reports, and sometimes even 
discouraging individuals from reporting crimes altogether. This manual system also poses 
challenges for police officers in managing and processing crime reports, often leading to backlogs 
and reduced effectiveness in responding to criminal activities. 
With the rise in crime rates and the increasing need for timely and accurate crime data, there is a 
pressing need for an Online Crime Reporting Management System. Such a system would 
streamline the process of reporting crimes, making it more accessible for citizens and more 
efficient for law enforcement agencies. 
An Online Crime Reporting Management System is a digital platform that enables citizens to 
report crimes via the internet. It allows for real-time submission of crime reports, which can 
include detailed descriptions, evidence such as photos or videos, and the location of the incident. 
This system would also facilitate the tracking of the status of reported crimes, providing 
transparency and updates to the complainants. 
According to studies by Lee and Park (2020), implementing an online crime reporting system can 
significantly improve public safety by enhancing the speed and accuracy of crime data collection, 
thus enabling law enforcement agencies to respond more swiftly and effectively. Additionally, 
such a system would alleviate the congestion and delays currently experienced at physical police 
stations, allowing police officers to focus more on crime prevention and investigation. 
 
 
1.2 Problem Statement 
Currently, the crime reporting process in Mbale City is highly inefficient due to its reliance on a 
manual, paper-based system. Citizens are required to physically visit police stations to report 
crimes, which often leads to long queues, significant delays, and frustration among complainants. 
This cumbersome process not only discourages some individuals from reporting crimes but also 
overwhelms the limited resources of law enforcement agencies, leading to delays in responding to 
and investigating reported incidents. 
The manual system also lacks the ability to efficiently manage and track crime reports, making it 
difficult for police officers to prioritize and allocate resources effectively. As a result, critical 

information may be lost or mishandled, and victims may not receive timely updates on the status of 
their cases. 
There is, therefore, a pressing need for an Online Crime Reporting Management System that 
allows citizens to report crimes easily and securely from anywhere, at any time. Such a system 
would reduce congestion at police stations, speed up the reporting process, and provide a 
centralized platform for managing and tracking crime reports. This would not only improve the 
efficiency of law enforcement operations but also enhance public trust in the justice system by 
ensuring that all reported crimes are handled promptly and transparently. 
 
1.3 Main Objective 
The main objective of this study is to develop an Online Crime Reporting Management System 
that will enable citizens to report crimes online and allow law enforcement agencies to manage, 
track, and respond to these reports more efficiently. The system aims to streamline the crime 
reporting process, reduce congestion at police stations, and improve the overall effectiveness and 
transparency of law enforcement operations in Mbale City. 
 
 
1.3.1 Specific Objectives 
i. To study the current crime reporting and management processes used by law enforcement 
agencies in Mbale City in order to identify system requirements. 
ii. To design an Online Crime Reporting Management System for Mbale City using the identified 
requirements. 
iii. To implement the designed Online Crime Reporting Management System using various 
programming languages like PHP, MySQL, and JavaScript among others. 
iv. To test and validate the Online Crime Reporting Management System to check for any errors 
and to ensure that it meets the user requirements and enhances the efficiency of crime reporting 
and management. 
 
                1.4 Scope 
The Online Crime Reporting Management System will be designed and developed for use by law 
enforcement agencies in Mbale City to facilitate the reporting, management, and tracking of 
criminal activities. The system will primarily serve the citizens of Mbale City, allowing them to 
report crimes online, submit evidence, and receive updates on their cases. 
Law enforcement officers will use the system to manage and prioritize crime reports, assign cases 
to relevant departments, and track the progress of investigations. While the initial implementation 
will focus on Mbale City, the system could potentially be extended to other regions to serve a 
broader area and enhance the efficiency of crime reporting and management across Uganda. 
The system will interact with existing law enforcement databases and possibly integrate with 
national crime databases to ensure comprehensive data sharing and coordination among various 

law enforcement agencies. 
  1.5 Significance 
The current crime reporting process in Mbale City relies heavily on manual methods, which are 
inefficient and prone to delays. The development and implementation of an Online Crime 
Reporting Management System offer the following advantages: 
i. Facilitates Easy Crime Reporting: The system allows citizens to report crimes online at any 
time, without the need to visit a police station, making the process more accessible and convenient. 
ii. Enhances Efficiency for Law Enforcement: By automating the crime reporting process, the 
system enables law enforcement agencies to manage, prioritize, and track crime reports more 
effectively, leading to quicker response times and better resource allocation. 
iii. Improves Data Management and Accessibility: The system provides a centralized platform 
for storing and retrieving crime reports, making it easier for law enforcement officers to access and 
manage case information. This reduces the risk of lost or mishandled reports. 
iv. Increases Transparency and Public Trust: The system allows complainants to track the 
status of their reports and receive updates, improving transparency in the handling of cases and 
fostering greater trust between the public and law enforcement agencies. 
v. Reduces Congestion at Police Stations: By enabling online crime reporting, the system 
reduces the need for citizens to physically visit police stations, thereby alleviating congestion and 
reducing waiting times for those who need in-person assistance 
 
 

Literature Review of a Crime Reporting Management System 
Chapter Two  
Literature Review 
 
2.0 
Introduction 
Chapter One presented the background information to the study highlighting the objectives, scope and significance 
to the study. This chapter is about the literature review of the financial management systems. It specifies what a 
Crime Reporting Management System is, what it needs and how it works for its enhancement. 
2.1 
Crime Reporting Management System (CRMS) 
A Crime Reporting Management System (CRMS) is a technology-driven platform designed to facilitate the reporting, 
recording, management, and analysis of criminal activities. It aims to streamline the communication between the 
public and law enforcement agencies, improve the accuracy of crime data, and enhance the efficiency of crime 
management processes. The integration of information technology in crime reporting is a response to the 
limitations of traditional manual systems, which are often plagued by inefficiency, delays, and inaccuracies (Johnson 
& Mason, 2019). 
 
 
2.2 
Types of Crime Reporting Management Systems 
2.2.1. Web-Based CRMS 
 
Web-based CRMS platforms are accessible via internet browsers and are designed to allow citizens to report crimes 
online. These systems typically feature user-friendly interfaces where users can submit detailed reports of criminal 
incidents, upload evidence such as photos or videos, and track the status of their reports. An example of such a 
system is the UK's "Action Fraud" website, which allows users to report fraud and cybercrime directly online (Smith 
& Jones, 2020). 
 
2.2.2. Mobile App-Based CRMS 
Mobile app-based CRMS provides a convenient and portable solution for crime reporting. These apps are designed 
for smartphones and tablets, offering features similar to web-based systems but with added functionality such as 

GPS location tagging and instant notifications. The "Citizen" app in the United States is a notable example, providing 
real-time crime alerts and allowing users to report incidents through their mobile devices (Brown & Davis, 2021). 
2.2.3. SMS-Based CRMS 
 
 
SMS-based CRMS is designed for areas with limited internet access, leveraging the ubiquity of mobile 
phones. Citizens can report crimes by sending text messages to a designated number, often 
accompanied by automated responses to gather more information. This system has been effectively 
implemented in various regions in Africa, where internet connectivity can be sporadic (Oluoch & 
Mugendi, 2020). 
 
 
2.3 
Other Related Systems 
 
 
2.3.1 Emergency Response Management Systems (ERMS): 
These systems manage the dispatch and coordination of emergency services. They often integrate with 
CRMS to provide a comprehensive response to reported incidents 
Emergency response systems, such as the 911 service in the United States, are integral to immediate 
crime reporting and management. These systems provide a direct line to emergency services, ensuring 
rapid response to incidents. However, they often lack the detailed data collection and long-term 
management capabilities of CRMS (Williams et al., 2018). 
Emergency Response Management Systems (ERMS) are designed to manage and coordinate the 
response to emergencies such as natural disasters, medical crises, and criminal incidents. These systems 
ensure a timely and organized response to incidents, mitigating their impact and improving public safety 
(Williams et al., 2018). 
2.3.1.0. Case: 9/11 Emergency Response System, United States 
On September 11, 2001, the 9/11 Emergency Response System in New York City was a critical 
component of the response efforts following the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center. The system 
enabled immediate communication and coordination among first responders, including firefighters, 
police officers, and emergency medical personnel. The effectiveness of the system highlighted the 
importance of real-time communication and coordination during large-scale emergencies (Smith, 2002). 
 
2.3.1.1. Modules 
•

2.3.1.3. Conclusion: While emergency response systems are crucial for immediate incident management, 
they are not designed for comprehensive data management and analysis, which are strengths of 
dedicated CRMS. 
ERMS enhance the effectiveness of CRMS by ensuring timely and coordinated emergency responses 
(Perry, 2013). 
 
 
2.3.2 Incident Reporting Systems (IRS): 
Used in various industries to report and manage incidents, these systems share similarities with CRMS 
but are broader in scope, often including non-criminal incidents. 
Incident Reporting Systems (IRS) are platforms designed to facilitate the reporting of various types of 
incidents, including workplace accidents, safety hazards, and criminal activities. They aim to streamline 
the process of incident documentation and follow-up (Smith & Jones, 2020). 
2.3.2.0. Case: Action Fraud, United Kingdom 
Action Fraud is the UK’s national reporting center for fraud and cybercrime. Managed by the City of 
London Police, Action Fraud allows citizens to report fraudulent activities online. This system has been 
instrumental in collecting data on fraud cases, providing law enforcement with the necessary 
information to investigate and combat these crimes. In 2019, Action Fraud received over 800,000 
reports, showcasing its critical role in incident reporting (Jones & Williams, 2020).

Conclusion: While IRS are versatile, they may lack the specific features required for efficient crime 
reporting and management (Johnson & Anderson, 2014). 
 
 
2.3.3. Public Safety Management Systems (PSMS): 
These systems encompass a range of tools and technologies used to ensure public safety, including crime 
reporting, traffic management, and disaster response. 
Public Safety Management Systems (PSMS) integrate various functions related to maintaining public 
safety, including crime prevention, emergency management, and community engagement. They aim to 
enhance the effectiveness of public safety operations (Johnson & Mason, 2019). 
2.3.3.0. Case: CompStat, New York City Police Department (NYPD) 
CompStat is a performance management system used by the NYPD to reduce crime and improve public 
safety. Implemented in the 1990s, CompStat involves collecting and analyzing crime data to identify 
trends and allocate resources effectively. This data-driven approach has significantly contributed to the 
reduction of crime rates in New York City by enabling more strategic and proactive policing (Silverman, 
2006). 
 

 
2.3.3.1. Modules 
• 
Crime Reporting: Allows citizens to report crimes. 
• 
Emergency Management: Coordinates responses to emergencies. 
•

Conclusion: PSMS provide a holistic approach to public safety but can be complex and costly to implement 
(Smith et al., 2018). 
 
 
2.3.4. Community Policing Platforms (CPP) 
Community policing platforms focus on fostering collaboration between police and community 
members to address local crime issues. These platforms may include features for reporting minor 
crimes, community alerts, and forums for discussion. Examples include platforms like "Next-door" in the 
US, which allows residents to report local issues and communicate with law enforcement (Garcia & 
Henderson, 2019). 
Community Policing Platforms (CPPs) focus on building relationships between law enforcement and the 
community to collaboratively address crime and safety issues. They emphasize preventive measures and 
community engagement (Garcia & Henderson, 2019). 
2.3.4.0. Case: Nextdoor, Various U.S. Cities 
Nextdoor is a private social network for neighborhoods that has been adopted by various police departments 
across the United States to enhance community policing efforts. Police departments use Nextdoor to 

communicate with residents about crime alerts, safety tips, and community events. For example, the San 
Francisco Police Department has used Nextdoor to increase community engagement and collaboration, 
leading to improved trust and cooperation between the police and local residents (Garcia & Henderson, 
2019). 
 
2.3.4.1. Modules 
• 
Reporting and Feedback: Enables citizens to report crimes and provide feedback. 
• 
Community Alerts: Sends alerts and updates to community members. 
• 
Discussion Forums: Facilitates discussions between community members and law enforcement. 
• 
Resource Sharing: Shares resources and information about safety measures. 
2.3.4.2. How the System Works CPPs allow community members to report issues and engage in 
discussions through online platforms. Law enforcement can send alerts and updates, fostering a 
collaborative approach to community safety.

• 
Scope Limitations: May not be suitable for addressing serious crimes requiring immediate 
response. 
 
 
Conclusion: Community policing platforms emphasize community engagement and preventive measures 
but may not offer the structured and systematic approach to crime reporting and management provided 
by CRMS. 
2.3.5. Integrated Law Enforcement Management Systems (ILEMS) 
 
 
Integrated law enforcement management systems are comprehensive platforms used by police 
departments to manage all aspects of their operations, including crime reporting, case management, 
personnel management, and resource allocation. Systems like the "National Crime Information Center" 
(NCIC) in the US provide extensive databases and tools for law enforcement agencies (Miller & Roberts, 
2020). 
Integrated Law Enforcement Management Systems (ILEMS) are comprehensive platforms designed to 

enhance the operational efficiency and effectiveness of law enforcement agencies. These systems 
integrate various functions such as crime reporting, case management, personnel management, and 
resource allocation into a single, cohesive platform. The primary goal of ILEMS is to streamline police 
operations, improve data accuracy, and facilitate better decision-making (Miller & Roberts, 2020). 
2.3.5.0. Case: National Crime Information Center (NCIC), United States 
The NCIC, managed by the FBI, is an integrated database system that provides criminal justice agencies 
with access to a wide range of criminal records, including stolen property, missing persons, and criminal 
histories. The NCIC is used by law enforcement agencies across the United States to share information 
and coordinate efforts. It has been pivotal in solving crimes, apprehending fugitives, and enhancing the 
overall efficiency of law enforcement operations (Miller & Roberts, 2020). 
 
2.3.5.1. Modules of ILEMS 
ILEMS typically consist of several interconnected modules, each focusing on a specific aspect of law 
enforcement operations: 
1. Crime Reporting: Allows for the electronic submission and recording of crime reports from both 
citizens and officers. 
2. Case Management: Manages the lifecycle of criminal cases, from initial report to investigation 
and resolution. 
3. Personnel Management: Handles the administration of police personnel, including scheduling, 
training, and performance evaluations. 
4. Resource Allocation: Manages the distribution and utilization of resources such as vehicles, 
equipment, and personnel. 
5. Data Analysis and Reporting: Provides tools for analyzing crime data, generating reports, and 
identifying trends and hotspots. 
6. Communication and Collaboration: Facilitates communication within the department and with 
other agencies, improving coordination and response times. 
2.3.5.2. How the System Works 
ILEMS integrate data from various sources and modules, creating a centralized database that law 
enforcement officers and administrators can access in real-time. When a crime is reported, the system 
logs the details and assigns a case number. Investigators can update the case status, add notes, and 
upload evidence, all of which are stored in the centralized system. Resource allocation modules help 
ensure that the necessary personnel and equipment are assigned to each case. Data analysis tools allow 
administrators to generate reports and analyze crime patterns, aiding in strategic decision-making 
(Miller & Roberts, 2020). 
2.3.5.3. Strengths/Benefits of the System 
 
1. Operational Efficiency: By integrating various functions into a single platform, ILEMS streamline 

operations and reduce the administrative burden on law enforcement personnel (Miller & 
Roberts, 2020). 
2. Improved Data Accuracy: Centralized data management ensures that information is consistent 
and up-to-date, reducing errors associated with manual data entry (Johnson & Mason, 2019). 
3. Enhanced Decision-Making: Advanced data analysis tools enable law enforcement agencies to 
identify crime trends, allocate resources effectively, and make informed decisions (Miller & 
Roberts, 2020). 
4. Better Coordination: Communication and collaboration modules improve coordination within 
the department and with other agencies, leading to faster response times and more efficient 
operations (Williams et al., 2018). 
2.3.5.4. Weaknesses/Problems of the System 
1. Complexity and Cost: ILEMS are often complex systems that require significant investment in 
terms of both time and money for implementation and maintenance. This can be a barrier for 
smaller law enforcement agencies with limited budgets (Miller & Roberts, 2020). 
2. Training Requirements: The complexity of ILEMS necessitates extensive training for personnel 
to use the system effectively. This can be resource-intensive and time-consuming (Miller & 
Roberts, 2020).

Chapter three 
Research methodology 
 
3.0.  Introduction  
The methodology focuses on the patterns of research, approaches to data collection, techniques 
for analysis and tools that were used for designing and implementation of the system. The 
Methodology was in line with the specific objectives of the proposed Online Crime Reporting 
Management System.  
3.1. System Study and Analysis 
 
The system study and analysis phase of developing a Crime Reporting Management System 
(CRMS) involves a comprehensive examination of the current processes, identification of 
requirements, feasibility analysis, and formulation of a solution that meets the needs of all 
stakeholders. 
 
3.1.1. System Study: 
 
The system study involves understanding the existing system, its limitations, and the 
requirements of the new system. The existing system is predominantly manual, with crime 
reporting and management processes relying on physical paperwork and face-to-face 
interactions. This can lead to inefficiencies, delays, and issues with data retrieval and analysis. 
 
The proposed system aims to digitize the entire process, providing an online platform for crime 
reporting, centralized data storage, and real-time case management. It addresses the limitations 
of the manual system by offering accessibility, efficiency, and improved data management. 
 
3.2.  Data Collection Techniques 
 
Data collection is critical to understand the needs and expectations of the stakeholders, and to 
gather the necessary information for system design and development. Various techniques are 
used to collect data: 
 

Tumusiime Joshua                                                                                                                                                  pg. 
17 
3.2.1. Interviews: Conduct interviews with police officers, administrative staff, and citizens to 
gather qualitative data about the current process, pain points, and desired features. 
3.2.2. Surveys: Distribute questionnaires to a larger audience to collect quantitative data on the 
usage patterns, satisfaction levels, and requirements. 
3.2.3. Observation: Observe the existing crime reporting and management processes in police 
stations to understand workflow, data handling, and interactions. 
3.2.4. Document Review: Analyze existing documents such as crime reports, case files, and 
administrative records to understand the data structure and information flow. 
 
 
 3.3. Data Analysis Methods 
 
Data analysis involves processing the collected data to extract meaningful insights and identify 
patterns. Various methods can be employed: 
 
3.3.1. Descriptive Analysis: Summarize the data using statistics such as averages, percentages, 
and frequencies to understand the general trends and patterns. 
3.3.2. Qualitative Analysis: Analyze interview and observation notes to identify common 
themes, issues, and suggestions. 
3.3.3. Comparative Analysis: Compare the current system with best practices and similar 
systems in other regions to identify gaps and areas for improvement. 
3.4. System Analysis and Design 
The analysis and design of the system was done by clearly identifying the inputs, the processes

An Entity is a real life object with an independent existence that interacts with the system. 
ii. 
Data store shows where data is stored after being processed. This can be a database or a file. 
iii. 
Data flow shows the movement of data within the system and also connects processes, data 
stores and external entities. 
iv. 
A Process is a series of activities or actions to accomplish a desired task. 
 
4.3.3 Data Flow Diagrams (DFD). 
It is one of the most important modeling tools used by system analysts. It is used to illustrate how data 
flows in a system. DFD’s use a number of symbols to represent systems. There are four kinds of symbols. 
These are used to represent four kinds of system components. Processes, data stores, data flows and 
external entities. 
4.3.3.1 The Context Level DFD  
A Context Level Data Flow Diagram (DFD) provides an overview of the entire Crime Reporting 
Management System by illustrating the system’s interactions with external entities. The context-level 
DFD is also known as a Level 0 DFD and includes the main process, external entities, and data flows 
between them.
