ABSTRACT 
This study examined the biblical views of divorce as presented in Matthew 19:3-9, focusing on 
understanding the scriptural teachings and their implications for contemporary Christian practice.  
The study explored various academic interpretations and perspectives on marriage and divorce. It 
investigated into the historical, theological, and sociocultural contexts that shaped these 
perspectives. By examining the works of theologians, biblical scholars, and historians, the 
research aimed to provide a comprehensive understanding of how marriage and divorce have 
been viewed and interpreted within the Christian tradition. This scholarly discussion highlighted 
the evolution of thought on these topics and how they aligned or diverged from the teachings 
found in Matthew 19:3-9. 
To Investigate Ways through which the Church Can Respond to Issues of Divorce that Arise in 
Families and Churches: The research focused on developing practical and pastoral strategies for 
the church to effectively address and manage divorce-related issues within its congregations and 
among its members. It considered current challenges faced by families and individuals 
experiencing divorce, and proposed ways the church could offer support, guidance, and healing. 
This included examining existing church practices and pastoral care models, as well as 
suggesting new approaches that were both theologically sound and pastorally sensitive. 
Through a thorough exegesis of Matthew 19:3-9 and a review of scholarly literature, this study 
sought to contribute to a deeper understanding of marriage and divorce in Christian theology. 
The exegesis involved a detailed analysis of the biblical text, considering its historical and 
literary context, and interpreting its meaning for contemporary believers. The review of scholarly 
literature provided a broad overview of the various interpretations and debates surrounding 
marriage and divorce in the Christian tradition. 
Ultimately, this research aimed to provide actionable insights for church leaders and practitioners 
in supporting families and individuals facing the challenges of divorce. By integrating biblical 
exegesis with scholarly perspectives and practical recommendations, the study hoped to offer a 
holistic approach to addressing divorce within the church. This research was submitted in partial 
fulfillment of the requirements for the award of a Bachelor's degree at Uganda Christian 
University

 CHAPTER ONE
CHAPTER ONE  GENERAL INTRODUCTION
 GENERAL INTRODUCTION 1.0 Introduction 
1.0 Introduction 
Divorce has long been a contentious issue across various religious, legal, and social contexts. 
Within the Christian tradition, biblical teachings play a key role in shaping views on divorce, 
with Matthew 19:3-9 standing as a serious passage. In this text, Jesus addresses the Pharisees' 
inquiry regarding the legitimacy of divorce by stressing the divine intention for marriage to be a 
lifelong and indissoluble union. Drawing from the Genesis creation narrative, Jesus asserts that 
marriage, as ordained by God, should not be dissolved by human actions. Citing France, R. T. 
However, “He acknowledges an exception in cases of "sexual immorality," a term that has been 
the subject of extensive theological debate which the study1” undertaken France.  
According to Carson, D. A.  Matthew 19:3-9 has deeply influenced Christian doctrines on 
marriage, divorce, and remarriage, highlighting the pressure between the ideal of lifelong 
marriage and the complications essential in human relationships. This research examines the 
Biblical views on divorce as presented in this passage, taking into account its historical and 
cultural context, theological significance, and its ongoing impact on Christian teachings. 
Through this exploration, the study aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how this 
scripture has informed Christian perspectives on divorce and how it continues to shape 
contemporary discussions on the subject2.  1.1 Background to the study 
1.1 Background to the study 
Christian teachings on marriage affirm that marriage is God’s idea not human being. This further 
argues that, According to John Stott “The Biblical revelation identifies that God purposefully 
instituted marriage for the mutual society, help and comfort that one ought to have, of the other 
both in prosperity and adversity, the procreation of children and their upbringing in an

environment of love and discipline, and for reciprocal (mutual) commitment of self-giving love 
which finds its natural expression in sexual union or becoming ‘one flesh3’. 
(1)The purposes for which God instituted marriage were all established at creation and must be 
seen as God’s provision for the institution of marriage. God designed marriage and the family to 
ensure that the world He created becomes a place of hope, happiness, love, friendship and peace. 
This makes marriage a vital establishment for a person’s happiness and contentment in life. The 
Christian view of marriage is a lifelong commitment. 
The beauty of marriage begins when a man and a woman fall in love and make preparation to 
live together as a husband and a wife. At this point in their lives, both put in much effort to make 
their purposes fulfilled. Unfortunately, the case now a marriage which began with tender love 
and rich expectations now lies in skeletons. The experience of divorce is very devastating with 
its challenges. John Stott citied “It violates God’s will, frustrates His purposes, and brings to a 
husband and(2)wife the pains of rejection, disappoint, guilt and the children of the marriage if 
there are any become vulnerable after divorce”. Divorce is a means whereby a legal marriage is 
dissolved publicly and the participants are free from further obligations of the matrimonial 
relationship. (3) Divorce has become an issue in our society as a result of the many consequences 
it brings on the parties involved, the children and the society at large. More than just affecting 
the immediate family, divorce can have a profoundly negative effect on society as a whole. 
Despite the sufferings accompanying divorce, the rate of divorce continues to be high. The 
negative effects is a drain on our churches and societies as a whole and the costs attached to them 
go far beyond just financial expenditure.(4) Cases of divorce have become so rampant and 
widespread, even in Christian marriages, some Men and Women of God are not spared. Despite 
the series of counseling sessions that are held for couples by their churches, divorce is still on the 
increase. Records from the Keri Archdeaconry of dissolution of marriages from the courts were 
recorded highly. This is the state in which the institution of marriage has found itself in the Keri 
Archdeaconry hence the researcher intends to look onto the biblical mandate for divorce4.

1.2 The problem statement on the topic 
According to the word of God marriage and family is guarantee that the world He created 
becomes a place of love, the teachings found in Matthew 19:3-9 stresses the divine institution of 
marriage as a sacred and lifelong commitment, with Jesus Christ emphasizing the permanent 
bond between husband and wife. However, contemporary society witnesses a significant rise in 
divorce rates, which poses a fundamental challenge to the biblical understanding of marriage 
within Christian communities. This research project aims to explore the underlying factors 
contributing to the conflict between the biblical teaching on marriage's permanence and the 
reality of marital breakdowns. By researching into the complexities surrounding marital stability, 
including societal influences, individual motivations, and spiritual perspectives, this study seeks 
to provide insights that align with Matthew 19:3-9 and offer potential interventions to strengthen 
marriages within Christian faith communities which seems not to be in the contemporary church. 
1.3 Research objectives  
To exegete the meaning of marriage in Matthew 19: 3-9 
To critically examine the social, cultural, and legal perspectives on marriage and divorce. 
To investigate ways through which the church can respond to issues of divorce that arise in 
families and churches. 
1.4 Research questions. 
What does the Bible teach on marriage and divorce according to Matthew 19:3-9 and Genesis 2? 
How do contemporary criticisms of marriage and divorce reflect the changing attitudes towards 
these institution? 
In what ways can the church respond to issues of divorce in family affecting the church? 
1.5 The significance of the study. 
The importance of this study is emphasized by the ever-increasing occurrence of divorce, 
particularly within the Christian community. Academic literature is especially lacking in 
comprehensive information regarding this topic, including the role of the church in addressing 
this emerging leaning in the following ways. 

 
 
4 
 
Contribute new insights to the existing knowledge base regarding marriage and divorce among 
Christians. 
Raise awareness regarding likely shortcomings within the Church, guiding future initiatives 
aimed at reducing divorce rates within our society. 
Increase sensitivity among both the church and the public regarding the ongoing tendency and 
impact of Christian divorces, disseminating findings through various media platforms. 
Establish itself as a reliable point of reference for future research actions on the subject 
1.6 Scope and focus of the study 
Due to restrictions of time and resources available for this research project, the study was be 
limited to remain in the library.  
1.1.0 Literature Review 
1.1.1 The Meaning of Marriage 
Biblical teachings define marriage as a relationship between a man and a woman. B. Powers 
explains that marriage serves a single purpose with three dimensions: companionship, mutual 
assistance, and the fulfillment of the sexual aspects of both man and woman. This union is built 
on mutual commitment and relies on the ongoing consent of both partners. Additionally, 
marriage is emphasized as a creation ordinance and a gift from God to humanity, designed for 
men and women5.  
1.1.2 Other Scholars' Views from Biblical Points 
Bible scholars see Genesis 2:24 as the basis for the meaning of marriage. The text states, 
“Therefore a man leaves his father and his mother and cleaves to his wife, and they become one 
flesh.” Jesus later quoted this when asked about permissible grounds for divorce (Matthew 19:4-
5). This verse was spoken by God right after Eve was brought to Adam, who recognized her as 
his God-given spouse6.  
In the Bible, marriage exists when a man leaves his parents to cleave to his wife and become one 
flesh with her. This reveals the Biblical understanding of marriage as a covenant relationship.

6 The Holy Bible, New International Version. (n.d.). Genesis 2:24.

Malachi 2:14 explicitly expresses this meaning, stating, “…It is because the Lord is acting as the 
witness between you and the wife of your youth, because you have broken faith with her, though 
she is your partner, the wife of your marriage covenant.7”  
Marriage is a lifelong commitment between a man and a woman involving mutual sexual rights. 
Characteristics of the biblical concept of marriage are found in Genesis 2:24, indicating that 
marriage is an exclusive man-woman relationship, publicly acknowledged and consummated by 
sexual intercourse. 
1.1.3 ‘Leaving’ – The First Component of the Marriage Covenant 
The first step in establishing a marriage covenant is leaving all other relationships, including the 
closest ones of father and mother: “Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother” (Gen 
2:24). The key word “leave,” expressed in Hebrew as aw-zah, means to release, forsake, leave 
destitute, or refuse. The idea here is that the man forsakes his parents, cuts himself off from 
them, and breaks the union with them almost in the sense of divorcing himself and becoming 
later single. It is as if he has been bound to them in a marriage state but, in an act of the will, 
departs from them regarding responsibility and dependence (if such exists) and becomes alone to 
unite with the chosen woman. The bridegroom cannot be both a dependent child and an 
independent husband in the same home. Even in a world infused with the concept of extended 
families, priorities must be kept straight. 
The text speaks specifically of the man in this matter. He must be his own head of the household. 
If in family relations he is dependent upon his father, then to whom do his dependents look for 
authority? It would create for his wife an unworkable ordered arrangement: she would have two 
heads (i.e., her husband and his father), which, according to Jesus (Matthew 6:24), is not right. In 
such an arrangement, the father’s authority would possibly overtake her husband’s, yet, 
according to the Scripture, it is the latter who is to be her final authority in family matters 
(Ephesians 5:22-34). 
Leaving does not mean the abandonment of one’s parents. The responsibility to “Honor your 
father and mother” (Ex 20:12) is applied by Jesus to adults (Mark 7:6-13). This is not evading 
our responsibility toward our parents as they grow old. Jesus despised the pretense of those who 
gave to the Temple the money they had set aside for their parents (Mark 7:9-13). As adults, 
                                                          
7 (New International Version, n.d.). 

 
 
6 
 
however, we assume responsibility for our parents rather than to them. The Bible never suggests 
that married couples should sever their ties with their parents, but that they must “let go” of their 
former lives as sons and daughters to cement their relationships as husbands and wives. What 
“leaving” means is that all lesser relationships must give way to the newly formed marital 
relationship8. 
A leaving must occur to cement a covenant relationship of husband and wife. This principle of 
leaving applies likewise to our covenant relationship with God. It is said of the disciples that 
“they left everything and followed Him” (Luke 5:11). Leaving is not always easy. It is often hard 
for a baby to leave his mother’s womb. It may look cruel to see a doctor cut the umbilical cord 
which binds the baby to the mother. Yet, it is necessary for the growth and development of the 
baby. It is also hard for children to leave their parents and for parents to let their children go. 
Similarly, a marriage cannot mature unless both partners are willing to leave their parents to 
cement a new marital relationship and establish a new family. 
Leaving involves ending financial dependence upon parents to stand financially on your own feet 
to develop your future plans independently. It again involves leaving behind parental authority 
since possessive, interfering parents can threaten the best marriages. This does not imply that 
parental authority ends with marriage or that one ignores, abandons, or forsakes his or her 
parents. In Ephesians 6:1, it is made clear that “Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this 
is right.” Also, in Exodus 20:12, “Honor your father and your mother and you may live long in 
the land the LORD your God is giving you.” Leaving means the husband-wife relationship is 
now the priority relationship. 
Another aspect of leaving is learning to abandon some of our parents’ attitudes and influences. In 
effect, the first principle derived from the divine institution of marriage recorded in Genesis 2:24 
is, ‘To establish an exciting “one flesh” marriage covenant, we must be willing to leave all lesser 
relationships.’ 
1.1.4 ‘Cleaving’ – The Second Component of the Marriage Covenant 
The second essential component of a marriage covenant is cleaving: “Therefore a man leaves his 
father and mother and cleaves to his wife” (Gen 2:24). A leaving must occur before a cleaving 
take place. This process reveals divine wisdom. A man and a woman must leave all relationships 
                                                          
8 (New International Version, n.d.). 

 
 
7 
 
for the purpose of cleaving, that is, cementing their new relationship and establishing a new 
home9.  
“Cleaving” reflects the central concept of covenant fidelity. The Hebrew word for “cleave” 
dabaq suggests the idea of being permanently glued or joined together. It is one of the words 
frequently used to express the covenant commitment of the people to God: “You shall fear the 
Lord your God; you shall serve him and cleave to Him” (Deuteronomy 10:20; cf. 11:22; 13:4; 
30:20). The word is used to describe Ruth’s refusal to leave her mother-in-law Naomi: “Ruth 
clave unto her” (Ruth 1:14). In the sight of God, cleaving means wholehearted commitment 
which falls over to every area of our being. Cleaving involves endless loyalty to one’s marital 
partner. Note that man is to cleave to “his wife.” This excludes marital unfaithfulness. A man 
cannot be glued to his wife and play or engage in sexual intercourse with another woman. The 
two are mutually limited. 
In a marriage covenant, cleaving does not allow the “freedom to leave” when the relationship is 
no longer satisfying. If the “freedom to leave” is retained as a real option, it will hinder the total 
effort to develop a marital relationship characterized by covenant faithfulness. As in marriage, 
“Keeping divorce as an escape clause indicates a flaw in your commitment to each other, even as 
a tiny crack can be fatally widened by the many forces working to destroy homes and families.” 
It could be summarized that the second principle derived from the divine institution of marriage 
recorded in Genesis 2:24 is: To maintain a exciting “one flesh” marriage covenant we must be 
willing to cleave to our marital partners, avoiding any thought, word, or action that could weaken 
loyalty and commitment to them. 
1.1.5‘Becoming One Flesh’ – The Third Component of the Marriage Covenant 
The third essential ingredient of a marriage covenant is that “they become one flesh” (Gen 2:24). 
Note the progression: leaving, cleaving, and becoming one flesh. As husband and wife leave 
lesser relationships and learn to cleave to one another, they become a new entity, “one flesh.” 
The phrase “one flesh” needs some explanation because it is frequently misunderstood to refer 
primarily to the sexual union. To become “one flesh” (Gen 2:24) means to become one 
functioning unit. Samuele Bacchiocchi quotes10, becoming one flesh “involves the complete 
identification of one personality with the other in a community of interests and pursuits, a union

consummated in intercourse.” Explained by H. C. Leopold11. The phrase “one flesh” does also 
refer to the physical or sexual aspect of marriage. Paul explicitly uses the phrase in this way 
when speaking of sexual intercourse between a man and a harlot (1 Cor. 6:16). Sexual 
intercourse, however, does not automatically assure that a man and a woman become one in a 
mystical, emotional, and spiritual unity. 
1.1.6 Conclusion;  
This chapter examined the Biblical foundations of marriage and divorce. The teachings of 
Genesis, the prophets, Jesus, and Paul regarding marriage consistently highlight how Scripture 
views marriage as a sacred and permanent covenant, overseen and safeguarded by God. Marriage 
as a sacred covenant is used in the Old Testament to depict God's relationship with Israel and in 
the New Testament to illustrate Christ's relationship with His church. If God used marriage to 
symbolize His commitment to His people, it must be seen as a sacred, enduring covenant. 
Reaffirming the Biblical perspective of marriage as a sacred and permanent covenant, guaranteed 
by God, is crucial to counteracting the secularization of marriage. This secularization has led 
many Christians to see marriage as a temporary social contract governed by civil laws, rather 
than a lasting covenant witnessed and guaranteed by God. To address this, Christians must 
rediscover and embrace the Biblical view of marriage as a sacred covenant.

Doe J states that historical criticism of Matthew 19:3-9 involves analyzing the passage within the 
historical and cultural context of ancient Judaism during Jesus' time. This process includes 
understanding the Pharisaic views on divorce, exploring the legal and religious framework of 
marriage in Jewish law, considering Jesus' broader teachings on ethics and the Kingdom of God, 
and conducting a comparative analysis with parallel passages in Mark 10:2-12 and Luke 16:18. 
By researching these aspects, historical criticism seeks to uncover the original meaning and 
significance of Jesus' teachings on divorce and remarriage for his contemporary audience12.  
1.2.2 Literal analysis of Matthew 19:3-9  
Interpreting Biblical Texts through Various Critical Approaches 
Understanding biblical texts requires a comprehensive approach encompassing different methods 
of criticism and analysis. This ensures a well-rounded interpretation of the scriptures, particularly 
in understanding theological concepts such as marriage and divorce. This section explores how 
different critical methods can be applied to the study of biblical texts, using Genesis 2:18-25 and 
Matthew 19:3-9 as focal points. Textual criticism involves examining manuscript evidence to 
reconstruct the original text. For studying God's mandate for marriage in Genesis, this entails 
weighing variant readings to recreate its initial meaning. This method focuses on the text as it 
was likely written, free from later alterations and interpolations. By comparing different 
manuscripts and versions, the researcher identifies the most authentic wording, ensuring an 
accurate interpretation of the biblical mandate for marriage. 
1.2.2.1 Historical Criticism 
Historical criticism seeks to reconstruct the history behind the text. For Genesis, this means 
understanding the cultural, religious, and historical context in which the text was written. This 
approach uncovers the background and circumstances that influenced the writing of Genesis, 
providing insights into the societal norms and theological concepts prevalent at the time. This 
deeper understanding of the historical context of God's mandate for marriage is crucial for 
interpreting its original intent and significance.

1.2.2.2 Lexical Analysis 
Lexical analysis involves conducting detailed word studies on key terms within a text. For 
Genesis 2:18-25, this means examining the meanings of words such as "helper," "suitable," and 
"one flesh" to understand their implications within the context of marriage. Lexical analysis 
clarifies the nuances of these terms, contributing to a more precise interpretation of the text. This 
method focuses on the individual words and their meanings, essential for understanding how 
they contribute to the overall message of the passage. Discourse analysis focuses on the flow and 
unity of the text, examining how ideas are developed and connected throughout the passage. For 
Matthew 19:3-9, discourse analysis involves analyzing the features that show the coherence and 
progression of the argument about divorce. This method identifies the rhetorical strategies and 
discourse markers used by the author to emphasize key points and maintain the logical flow of 
the discussion. This study involves gathering information about the views on divorce and 
marriage from different authors, analyzing the text of Matthew 19:3-9, and conducting exegesis 
to establish a comprehensive understanding of the biblical perspective on divorce.

CHAPTER TWO 
EXEGESIS OF MATTHEW 19:3-9 
2.0 Introduction 
Matthew 19:3-9 is essential passage that discovers the issue of divorce within the broader context 
of marriage. It begins with the Pharisees questioning Jesus about the acceptability of divorce for 
any reason. In His response, Jesus refers to the Genesis account to emphasize that marriage was 
intended by God to be a lifelong, indivisible union. While Jesus acknowledges the Mosaic 
concern permitting divorce due to "hardness of heart" (σκληροκαρδία), He emphasizes that this 
concession was a temporary allowance due to human failure and not part of the original divine 
plan for marriage. To fully understand this passage, it is essential to consider the common 
historical context of beginning Jewish marriage practices. During this age, men could initiate 
divorce for various reasons, reflecting the broader discussion among Jewish scholars, such as 
Hillel and Shammai, about the grounds for divorce. The Pharisees' question highlights the 
complication and disagreement of these practices. 
The passage features significant terms like "hardness of heart" (σκληροκαρδία) and "one flesh" 
(σὰρξ μία), which explain the moral failings and ideal unity of marriage, respectively. The 
analysis of Jesus' response reveals His confident in interpretation of Scripture, reinforcing the 
sacredness of marriage. The interaction between Jesus and the Pharisees shifts from a legal 
discussion to a profound theological statement, reflecting a dynamic conflict. This tension 
illustrates a disagreement story, revealing of broader dissatisfaction with existing divorce norms. 
Source criticism suggests that Matthew's account may have been influenced by earlier traditions, 
including those from the Gospel of Mark, to address issues related to his community. Matthew 
focus was on highlighting theological themes, aligning Jesus' teachings with Old Testament 
scriptures (see France. Additionally, rhetorical criticism examines how Jesus uses scriptural 
authority to challenge contemporary divorce practices and reaffirm the purity of marriage13.

2.1 The text.  
Matthew 19:3-9 (ESV) 3 And Pharisees came up to him and tested him by asking, “Is it lawful to 
divorce one's wife for any cause?” 4 He answered, “Have you not read that he who created them 
from the beginning made them male and female, 5 and said, ‘Therefore a man shall leave his 
father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh’? 6 So they 
are no longer two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate.” 7 
They said to him, “Why then did Moses command one to give a certificate of divorce and to send 
her away?” 8 He said to them, “Because of your hardness of heart Moses allowed you to divorce 
your wives, but from the beginning it was not so. 9 And I say to you: whoever divorces his wife, 
except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery.”  
2.2 Historical background 
The Gospel of Matthew is traditionally attributed to Matthew, a tax collector and one of Jesus' 
apostles. The author exhibits a profound understanding of Jewish customs, scriptures, and 
prophetic fulfillment, indicating a background closely aligned with Jewish traditions.  
The primary audience of Matthew's Gospel is Jewish Christians. The text emphasizes Jesus as 
the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies and presents Him as the long-awaited Messianic 
King14. 
The purpose of the Gospel is to present Jesus as the Messianic King and authoritative teacher 
who fulfills the Law and the Prophets. It aims to establish the legitimacy of Jesus' teachings and 
his role in God's redemptive plan15.  
According to R. T. France, the late first-century context of Matthew's Gospel highlights the 
community's efforts to navigate their faith among Jewish traditions. The Gospel of Matthew was 
composed during this period, marked by the promising Christian community's efforts to define 
its identity distinct from Judaism. This era saw significant theological and social challenges as 
Christians navigated their faith in a predominantly Jewish context. Notes that Matthew's This 
Gospel reflects Jewish customs, concerns, and the pressing need to reinterpret Mosaic Law to align with 
the teachings of Jesus”.

2.3.0 Messages in Matthew 19:3-9: 
2.3.1 Verse3: Lawful (ἔξεστιν, exestin) Divorce (ἀπολύω, apolyō) Wife (γυνή, gynē) 
According to R. T. France in "The Gospel of Matthew" from the New International Commentary 
on the New Testament, "The question posed by the Pharisees aims to draw Jesus into the 
ongoing debate between the Hillel and Shammai schools" (p. 280). The Pharisees, known for 
their strict adherence to the Mosaic Law, approached Jesus with the intent of trapping him in a 
theological debate. Their inquiry, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any and every 
reason?" was designed to involve Jesus in the argumentative dialogue regarding the grounds for 
divorce. This question stresses the differing interpretations among Jewish scholars, particularly 
the contrasting views of the Hillelite and Shammaite schools. The Hillelites advocated for a more 
lenient stance, allowing divorce for minor causes, while the Shammaites maintained a stricter 
position, restricting divorce to serious wrongdoings such as adultery. 
According to U. Luz in "Matthew 8-20: A Commentary" from the Hermeneia Series, "The 
Pharisees' query is rooted in the complex and often contentious interpretations of Deuteronomy 
24:1-4" The Pharisees' question reflects a legalistic approach, examining Jesus' conformity to the 
Mosaic Law. Jewish law, as outlined in Deuteronomy 24:1-4, permitted divorce, although the 
conditions and justifications for such an act were subjects of significant debate. This encounter 
highlights the dominant cultural and religious context: while divorce was permissible, the 
grounds for it remained a sensitive issue. 
2.3.2 Verse 4: Beginning (ἀρχή, archē) Creator (κτίζω, ktizō) 
Jesus redirects the discussion to the foundational creation narrative, invoking Genesis 1:27. His 
rhetorical question, "Haven't you read," appeals to the authority of Scripture, which the Pharisees 
revered. By highlighting that the Creator "made them male and female," Jesus underscores the 
original divine intent for human beings and their relational dynamics. Bauckham16. Notes, "Jesus' 
citation of Genesis establishes a foundational basis for understanding the divine intent of 
marriage" This assertion serves to remind the Pharisees of the inherent purpose and sacredness 
rooted within the institution of marriage as imagined at the beginning of creation17.  
                                                          
16 Bauckham, R. (2006). Jesus and the eyewitnesses: The gospels as eyewitness testimony. Eerdmans. 
17 Hamilton (1990) similarly observes, "The creation account in Genesis establishes a theological foundation for 
understanding human relationships and marriage" (p. 131). 

 
 
16 
 
Jesus' reference to Genesis challenges the Pharisees' legalistic focus by appealing to a higher, 
more foundational theological principle. The creation account establishes the binary nature of 
humanity and the complementary design of male and female, intended for unity and mutual 
fulfillment. This invocation of Scripture situates Jesus' response within a broader theological 
framework, emphasizing divine intentionality over human legalism. 
2.3.3 Verse 5: Leave (καταλείπω, kataleipō), United (προσκολλάω, proskollaō) Flesh 
(σάρξ, sarx) 
By quoting Genesis 2:24, Jesus elucidates the profound unity and permanence of the marital 
bond. The passage, "For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his 
wife, and the two will become one flesh," signifies a transformative and covenantal union. 
Waltke and Fredrick state, "The concept of 'one flesh' signifies an intimate and unbreakable 
union within the marital relationship" This union transcends previous familial allegiances, 
establishing a new, primary relationship between husband and wife. The metaphor of "one flesh" 
conveys the depth of this connection, implying an indivisible and holistic partnership18.  
In Jewish tradition, familial loyalty and the honor accorded to parents were paramount. Jesus' 
assertion that a man will leave his father and mother to be united with his wife introduces a 
radical reordering of relational priorities. The emphasis on the "one flesh" concept denotes an 
indissoluble unity, challenging contemporary norms and practices concerning marriage and 
divorce. 
2.3.4 Verse 6: One (εἷς, heis) Joined (συνζεύγνυμι, synzeugnymi) Separate (χωρίζω, 
chōrizō) 
Jesus culminates his argument with a definitive pronouncement on the divine sovereignty over 
marriage. The statement, "So they are no longer two, but one flesh," reiterates the indivisibility 
of the marital union. Jesus further asserts, "Therefore what God has joined together, let no one 
separate," raising divine authority and leaving out human interference in the dissolution of 
marriage. Hays comments, "Jesus' assertion of divine authority over marriage challenges

contemporary legalistic practices and underscores the covenantal nature of the union" (p. 347). 
This principle affirms the sanctity and permanence of the marital covenant as ordained by God19.  
This teaching starkly contrasts with the prevalent divorce practices of the time, which were often 
subject to human caprice and legalistic interpretations. Jesus' declaration elevates the discussion 
to a theological plane, emphasizing covenant fidelity and divine right. The indissolubility of 
marriage as articulated here challenges the permissive attitudes towards divorce and underscores 
a higher ethical and theological standard. 
2.3.5 Verse 7: Certificate (βιβλίον, biblion) Divorce (ἀποστάσιον, apostasion). 
The Pharisees counter Jesus' argument by invoking Deuteronomy 24:1-4, which stipulates the 
issuance of a certificate of divorce. Their question, "Why then did Moses command that a man 
give his wife a certificate of divorce and send her away?" highlights a perceived discrepancy 
between Jesus' teachings and Mosaic Law. Instone-Brewer explains, "Moses' regulation was a 
protective measure designed to prevent arbitrary divorces and ensure legal recognition" (p. 89). 
The Pharisees interpret Moses' regulation as a prescriptive command, implying an endorsement 
of divorce under certain conditions.20  
Moses' regulation concerning divorce was instituted within a patriarchal society to provide a 
measure of protection for women. By mandating a formal certificate, the law aimed to prevent 
arbitrary and capricious dismissals, thereby safeguarding women's rights and ensuring legal 
recognition of the dissolution of marriage21.  
The Pharisees' reference to this law reflects a legalistic interpretation, focusing on the procedural 
aspects rather than the underlying ethical principles. Brown notes, "The historical context of 
Matthew's Gospel reflects the early Christian community's struggles to define its identity and 
beliefs"22.

2.3.6 Verse 8: Permitted (ἐπιτρέπω, epitrepō) Hard hearts (σκληροκαρδία, sklērokardia) 
Jesus attributes Moses' allowance for divorce to the hardness of human hearts, emphasizing the 
need for higher ethical standards (Nolland, by stating, "Moses permitted you to divorce your 
wives because your hearts were hard," Jesus highlights the concession as a response to human 
fallibility and moral obstinacy. He contrasts this with the original divine intent, "But it was not 
this way from the beginning," underscoring the distinction between divine ideal and human 
accommodation23. 
Moses' allowance for divorce was a pragmatic response to the realities of human sinfulness and 
the hardness of heart. It aimed to mitigate potential injustice and harm within the marital 
relationship. However, Jesus reaffirms the original divine standard for marriage, rooted in 
creation, which envisaged a permanent and sacred union. This higher ethical standard calls for 
adherence to the divine ideal rather than mere legal compliance. The phrase "hardness of heart" 
indicates a moral and spiritual deficiency necessitating regulatory measures24.  
2.3.7 Verse 9: Sexual immorality (πορνεία, porneia) Adultery (μοιχάω, moichaō) 
The exception for sexual immorality (πορνεία, porneia) reflects the gravity of this breach of the 
marital covenant (Wenham & Heth, Jesus’ teaching on divorce and remarriage sets a high ethical 
standard, emphasizing the sanctity of marriage25. By introducing the exception clause, "except 
for sexual immorality," Jesus permits divorce in cases of marital infidelity. However, He also 
reinforces the principle of marital fidelity by stating that remarriage after an unjustifiable divorce 
constitutes adultery26.  
This teaching raises the sanctity of marriage and stresses the ethical demands of covenant 
loyalty. By permitting divorce only in cases of sexual immorality, Jesus challenges the merciful 
contemporary practices that allowed for divorce on small grounds. This emphasis on marital 
fidelity and the significance of divorce and remarriage bring into line with broader theological 
themes of holiness, covenant, and divine intention27.

2.4 The General Message of Matthew19:3-9 
The Pharisees' question about divorce was not a genuine inquiry but rather a test to trap Jesus in 
a theological debate, highlighting the contentious nature of the topic in Jewish society at that 
time. 
Jesus refers back to Genesis 1:27 and 2:24, emphasizing God's original intention for marriage as 
a lifelong union between one man and one woman, with divorce not being a part of the divine 
plan from the beginning. This portrays Jesus approving God's original plan for marriage as a 
lifetime union between a man and a woman, condemning divorce except in cases of sexual 
immorality. This scripture stresses the importance of honoring marital commitments, the spiritual 
and moral aspects of relationships within the setting of God. 
Mosaic Law vs. God's Ideal Jesus gaps the permissive nature of the Mosaic Law regarding 
divorce (Deuteronomy 24:1-4) with God's ideal standard of marriage, highlighting the hardness 
of human hearts as the reason for the law's allowance. 
Exception Clause Jesus allows for divorce in cases of sexual immorality (Greek: πορνεία, 
porneia), indicating a break of the marital covenant that justifies separation. 
In contrast to Genesis 1:27 states, "So God created mankind in his own image, in the image of 
God he created them; male and female he created them." This verse establishes the foundational 
principle of humanity being created in God's image and the dual nature of genders (male and 
female). Jesus' reference to this in Matthew 19 reaffirms the sanctity and permanence of the 
marital union based on God's original design. 
The passage in Matthew 19:3-9 addresses difficult issues surrounding divorce, marriage, and 
God's design for human relationships. It underscores the importance of understanding Biblical 
principles in their original context while also dealing with contemporary ethical and societal 
challenges. 
The tension between Mosaic Law, cultural practices, and God's ideal standard raised questions 
about the interpretation and application of Biblical teachings in different historical and cultural 
settings. Additionally the exception clause regarding sexual immorality sparks debates about the 
grounds for divorce within Christian ethics. 

 
 
20 
 
Understanding the language tones through the lexicon analysis enriches our understanding of the 
Biblical text, enabling a more interpretation. Ultimately, Matthew 19:3-9 invites believers to 
reflect on the Godly intention for marriage, the difficulties of human relationships and the 
importance of upholding God's standards of faithfulness, love, and reconciliation. 
2.5 Conclusion 
Matthew 19:3-9 presents a powerful affirmation of the sacredness and permanence of marriage, 
where Jesus addressed the issue of divorce within the context of God's original design. Through 
His dialogue with the Pharisees, Jesus reaffirms that marriage is intended to be a lifelong union 
between a man and a woman, emphasizing that divorce is permissible only in cases of sexual 
immorality. This passage underlines the importance of honoring marital commitments and 
highlights the spiritual and moral dimensions of relationships as planned by God. Jesus' 
teachings challenge the prevalent cultural norms of divorcing for small reasons, calling for a 
return to a higher ethical standard rooted in divine intentions. 
The exegesis provides a comprehensive analysis of the text's philological, history and theological 
aspects, revealing the fundamental nature of Jesus' message. By examining key terms and related 
backgrounds, the study explains Jesus' profound teachings on the permanence of marriage, 
emphasizing that it is not merely a social contract but a sacred covenant requiring total 
commitment. The exploration of these themes reaffirms the foundational role of marriage within 
the divine order, setting a higher standard for covenant fidelity and stressing the theological 
significance of marital unity.

CHAPTER THREE 
CRITICS OF MARRIAGE AND DIVORCE   
3.0 Introduction 
In our contemporary secular world, the perception of marriage is increasingly characterized by 
three fundamental concepts. Firstly, marriage is often seen as a legal domestic partnership, where 
ending the relationship legally is not considered significant. Secondly, it is primarily viewed as a 
sexual arrangement between a man and a woman, with minimal societal impact when it ends. 
Thirdly, marriage is sometimes reduced to a purely commercial arrangement, akin to ending a 
business partnership. 
These secular views contrast sharply with the biblical perspective of marriage as ordained by 
God. McLuhan emphasizes that the sanctity and dignity of marriage, according to biblical 
teachings, are tied to the creation and procreation of complete human beings in body, soul, and 
spirit. Scriptural marriage involves a deep unity of spirit, soul, and body, along with shared God 
and physical familiarity. This chapter critically examine the social, cultural, and legal 
perspectives on marriage and divorce, discovering how these institutions have developed over 
time and the impact of these changes on modern society. 
3.1 Scholars’ Views 
In our contemporary secular world, the perception of the marriage relationship is progressively 
characterized by three essential concepts. Firstly, it is often seen as a legal domestic partnership, 
where the ending of the relationship legally is not considered a significant issue. Secondly, it is 
primarily viewed as a sexual arrangement between a man and a woman, and their decision to end 
the relationship is seen as a personal matter with minimal societal impact. Thirdly, marriage is 
sometimes reduced to a purely commercial arrangement, where its termination is like to ending 
any business partnership. 
McLuhan emphasizes that these secular views contrast sharply with the biblical perspective of 
marriage as ordained by God. The sanctity and dignity of marriage, according to biblical 
teachings, are tied to the creation and procreation of complete human beings in body, soul, and 

 
 
22 
 
spirit. True scriptural marriage involves a deep unity of spirit, soul, and body, along with a 
shared God, and love-driven physical familiarity28. 
John Stott adds that while marriage is a recognized human institution across societies, it is 
fundamentally God's idea, not a human invention, according to Christian teachings29. Francis 
Benyah further expands on this by noting that marriage has endured as an institution with various 
cultural interpretations since biblical times. He points to Genesis 2:24 as a central biblical 
reference that encapsulates the essence of biblical marriage—a union where a man leaves his 
parents to be united with his wife, forming a profound oneness.30 It can be indirect that the initial 
picture of marriage in the Bible, involving leaving, cleaving, and becoming one flesh, signifies 
the biblical concept of marriage as a covenantal relationship. Benyah also suggests that God's 
intention for marriage was for it to be a lifelong union. The man's departure from his parental 
home to unite with his wife and become one flesh with her reflects this divine design. Both Jesus 
(Matthew 19:5) and Paul (Ephesians 5:31) referenced this Genesis passage as the foundational 
understanding of marriage31.  Based on this passage, it is in directly that the initial representation 
of marriage in the Bible, involving leaving, cleaving, and becoming one flesh, signifies the 
biblical concept of marriage as a covenant relationship. Additionally, Benyah suggests that God 
intended marriage to be a permanent union, where the man leaves his parental home to unite with 
his wife and become one flesh with her. Both Jesus (Matthew 19:5) and Paul (Ephesians 5:31) 
referenced this Genesis passage as the foundational evidence of marriage. 
Moving on to the African concept of marriage, Kwame Gyekye views marriage as a fundamental 
institution in African society, serving not only to establish and maintain families but also to 
create and uphold kinship ties. He notes that in many African societies, a young man with 
employment and income is expected to marry, and delays may lead to parental or elder 
intervention to encourage marriage. Emphasizing that remaining unmarried is often viewed as 
unusual, indicating societal expectations of marriage.

Rebecca Ganusah further reinforces this view by highlighting Mbiti's agreement with Gyekye's 
view, stating that marriage is not just a personal choice but a societal duty and a important aspect 
of life that everyone is expected to participate in. Failure to do so may be seen as a disruption to 
the community and can carry negative social connotations32.   
 Not marrying under normal circumstances implies that the individual has rejected societal 
norms, leading society to reciprocate (respond) by rejecting them. G. K. Nunkunya shares a 
similar perspective, defining marriage as a union recognized legally, religiously, and culturally 
between a man and a woman who have followed societal procedures.33  
Rebecca Ganusah emphasizes that marriage holds immense value in African societies, and 
remaining unmarried past a certain age draws attention and may be interpreted negatively. For 
instance, an unmarried man might be seen as antisocial or irresponsible. Ganusah also notes that 
in Africa, marriage extends beyond the couple to include the families of both the man and 
woman. The household network encompasses relatives by blood, creating a communal life where 
the well-being of a couple affects the whole extended family34.  
3.2 Marriage as Portrayed in the Book of Genesis 
Many scholars of the Bible regard Genesis 2:24 as foundational for understanding the heart of 
marriage. The verse summarizes the definition of marriage: "Therefore a man leaves his father 
and his mother and cleaves to his wife, and they become one flesh35.  
Jesus later referenced this verse when questioned about acceptable reasons for divorce (Matthew 
19:4-5). Notably, Genesis 2:24 was spoken by God immediately after Eve was presented to 
Adam, signifying Adam's recognition of her as his God-given partner 
Research can conclude that according to the biblical perspective, a marriage is recognized by 
God when a man not only physically separates from his parents but also committed to deep 
promise with his wife, represented by becoming one flesh with her. The explanation of marriage

in Genesis 2:24, which involves leaving, cleaving, and becoming one flesh, stresses the idea of 
wedding as a covenantal relationship. This covenant of companionship is further explained in 
biblical. Malachi 2:14, where God is depicted as the witness to the marriage covenant and 
reproves against breaking faith with one's spouse. 
Understanding the Christian perspective on the purpose and core of marriage is crucial. It is 
viewed as a lifelong commitment between a man and a woman, surrounding mutual sexual 
rights. Benyah Francis, “because your heart were hard: an examination of Jesus’ discourse on 
divorce in Mark 10:2-12”36,   
The biblical concept of marriage is reflected in the statement from Genesis 2:24 (KJV): 
"Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they 
shall be one flesh." This verse emphasizes that marriage is an exclusive relationship between a 
man and a woman, publicly recognized and hardened through sexual intimacy. Samuele 
Bacchiocchi refers to these aspects as the central components of the marriage covenant. Samuele 
Bacchiocchi, the Marriage Covenant: a biblical study on marriage, divorce and remarriage37. 
3.3 Conclusion 
The prevailing secular views of marriage—often seen as a legal, sexual, or commercial 
arrangement—tend to reduce its perceived meaning and enable its dissolution. This modern 
perspective suddenly contrasts with the Biblical understanding, which presents marriage as a 
divinely instituted covenant characterized by deep sacredness and permanence. McLuhan’s 
analysis emphasizes the biblical portrayal of marriage as a complete union of body, soul, and 
spirit, which integrates both divine purpose and personal commitment. 
This scriptural foundation supports the view of marriage as an enduring, sacred covenant, 
standing in opposition to secular interpretations that often undermine its theological and moral 
importance. The biblical model thus provides a timeless and divine framework that challenges 
contemporary secular reductions, reaffirming the enduring significance of marriage as a sacred 
institution.

CHAPTER FOUR 
THE CHURCH RESPONSE ON DIVORCE 
4.0 Introduction 
The prevalence of divorce has become widespread, with nearly every Christian encountering it 
not only within their church but also among their close associates. This chapter discovers the 
response of churches to divorce cases within the church and societies. Furthermore, it gives light 
on the church's purpose and responsibility concerning the matter of divorce. 
The term "church" in the English Bible is translated from the Greek word "ekklesia." This word 
combines "kaleo" (to call) with the prefix "ek" (out), thus meaning "the called out ones." A more 
precise translation would be "assembly" since "ekklesia" referred to a group of people 
summoned for a meeting. It was also synonymous with "synagogue," which signifies a gathering 
or "Body of Christ." As believers are united with Christ through spiritual baptism, they are 
collectively known as the body of Christ (Romans 12:4-5; 1 Corinthians 12:11, 13, 18, 27; 
Colossians 1:18; Ephesians 5:30). This metaphor highlights both the interdependence and 
diversity among members (Romans 12:4; 1 Corinthians 12:14-17)38. 
The purpose of the church According to David Kpobi, the purpose of the church is to 
communicate God’s purpose for the world and for individual lives and to present Jesus as the one 
who can provide genuine meaning to life. Additionally, Christian mission aims to integrate the 
practice of faith with all aspects of life, encouraging Christians to make a positive impact 
wherever they are. 
M. G. McLuhan emphasizes that the increasing disregard for the sanctity of marriage in secular 
society is leading many believers, who were previously married to unbelievers, to return to the 
church after experiencing unwanted divorces. The rise of self-centeredness and narcissistic 
behavior is infiltrating the church, contributing to a higher divorce rate among believers. 
McLuhan further argues that the challenge lies not only in defending and preserving the 
sacredness of marriage among believers but also in scripturally restoring fellowship, self-respect, 
and forgiveness among the many individuals affected by divorce.

Regarding the purpose of the church, McLuhan points out that the New Testament indicates the 
church's primary role in the world is to facilitate reconciliation between God and humanity and 
among people. He supports this views Christ’s own statement about His mission in Luke 4:18, 
suggesting that the church is tasked with continuing Christ's ministry on earth39.  
The writer states that dedicated Christians who have been entangled in the complexities of 
divorce often face the shame of being instantly labeled as spiritual pariahs and societal rejects by 
the church. 
The insights provided by David Kpobi and McLuhan are crucial sources of information for this 
study because it focuses on examining the church’s role in addressing the widespread issue of 
divorce in our modern age. The researcher believes that the church's fundamental duty is to 
promote peace, comprehension, unity, and reconciliation in the world. Therefore, the church 
bears the responsibility of actively contributing to addressing the problem of divorce through 
education on marriage, both before and after marriage. This study digs into how churches are 
addressing divorce cases and the individuals who have gone through divorce40.  
Considering the above, the researcher aimed to explore how churches are handling divorce cases 
through pastoral care and counseling. Pastoral care and counseling are crucial for sustaining 
marriages. What approaches can the Church adopt in its pastoral care? In the effort to stabilize 
marital relationships, priests, pastors, and counselors in Ghana face a significant responsibility. 
They must utilize all available means to guide married individuals towards a deeper 
understanding of themselves and each other within marriage, thereby strengthening their marital 
bonds. The role of pastors and counselors is to reduce confusion and foster healthy, Christian 
relationships within families and society as a whole. Any pastoral models suggested for marriage 
must align with the will of God as depicted in Holy Scripture41.  
The church made efforts to counsel individuals in order to prevent divorces. However, they do 
not conduct visits to check on the status of marriages but instead only meet with couples at the 
church. It’s   evident that the church does offer counseling to prevent divorces, but there are

areas for improvement. The importance of practical counseling before marital problems worsen 
to divorce and emphasized the need for gender-balanced skill in handling marital issues. 
4.1 The church’s response to the decision to divorce 
Regarding the church's efforts to prevent divorces, the majority of respondents indicated that 
they did not involve the church in their decision-making process. Some of their responses 
include: 
Reasons for divorces within the church include infidelity, misplaced priorities, irresponsibility, 
dishonesty, sexual issues, long-distance marriages, interference from in-laws,  
4.2 Lack of submission and childbirth challenges. 
Many members who have undergone divorce either left the church before their situation was 
known or departed when the church intervened, leading to a lack of specific programs or support 
structures for divorcees within the church. 
Regarding the church’s stance on divorce and its treatment of divorcees, the church I serve does 
not condone divorce in any circumstances. Even in cases of adultery, forgiveness is encouraged, 
and there are no specific activities for divorcees. The church I serve is very strictly oppose 
divorce and provides no programs for divorcees.  
Divorce is not supported in church in the church I serve in that is church of Uganda in the 
province of church of Uganda, and leaders who divorce may lose their positions into the church 
leadership." There is no place for divorce in our church42.  
4.3 Period for pre-marital counseling 
Provide comprehensive pre-marital counseling that delves into biblical principles of marriage, 
such as Ephesians 5:22-33, which highlights the roles of husbands and wives and emphasizes 
mutual love and respect. 
Cover topics like communication (Proverbs 18:13), conflict resolution (Matthew 5:9), financial 
management (1Timothy 6:17-19), and spiritual unity (1Corinthians 7:5) to equip couples with 
practical skills and a solid foundation in their faith When asked about the duration of pre-marital 
counseling, counselors indicated that it typically lasts three months for couples within the same

church and six months if one partner is from a different church according to the marriage order 
of church of Uganda. This longer period is because they may not be familiar with the person's 
background and thus require more time to establish rapport. From these accounts, it's evident that 
the church does try to counsel couples considering divorce, but often, individuals choose to 
disengage from the church before significant intervention can occur43. 
4.4 Content of pre-marital counseling 
In terms of the content covered in pre-marital counseling, counselors highlighted several key 
teachings including the Bible's perspective on marriage and singleness, the roles of husbands and 
wives, strategies for creating a happy home, common issues in Christian marriages, and sex 
education for couples. These teachings are derived from a handbook used by counselors. 
4.5 Availability of post-marital counseling 
The church view on divorce and how divorcees are handled in the church. The church under 
study firmly upholds the covenant concept of marriage, emphasizing the sanctity and 
permanence of the marital bond. Consequently, the church does not condone or tolerate divorce 
within marriages. Despite this stance, it became evident through interviews that the church has 
encountered instances of divorce among its members, and some marriages within the church are 
currently grappling with significant marital challenges. 
Various reasons were cited for these divorces, including infidelity, misplaced priorities, 
irresponsibility, deception, sexual issues, long-distance marriages, interference from in-laws, 
lack of submission, and challenges related to childbirth. 
One notable observation from the interviews was that many members who had gone through 
divorce either left the church before the church became aware of the situation or departed when 
the church attempted to intervene or provide redress. As a result, the church did not have any 
specific programs or support structures in place for divorcees, as they often did not remain within 
the church community after divorcing44.

4.6 Premarital counseling is viewed as a strategic investment in couples' futures.  
While it doesn't guarantee success, it significantly increases the chances of a successful marriage. 
These counseling sessions cover crucial topics such as communication, conflict resolution, 
financial management, and spiritual unity, drawing from biblical principles like Ephesians 5:22-
33 and 1 Corinthians 7:5. Premarital counseling is seen as a strategic investment in the future of 
couples embarking on marriage. While there are no absolute guarantees, engaging in pre-
marriage counseling is about increasing the likelihood of success in marriage. During these 
counseling sessions, couples delve into essential problem-solving skills, openly discuss their 
expectations, identify their strengths and areas needing growth, and explore how their family 
backgrounds might shape their marriage dynamics. This process equips them to be more 
understanding and prepared for the challenges that may arise. Research suggests that couples 
who actively participate in premarital courses are less likely to consider divorce as an option45.   
Rice's advocacy for three formal preparations – Premarital Education, Assessment, and 
Counseling – aligns with the belief that proper orientation is key to marriage success, supported 
by biblical wisdom (Proverbs 3:5-6).  Rice advocates for the significance of three formal 
preparations crucial for successful marriages: Premarital Education, Premarital Assessment, and 
Premarital Counseling. This perspective aligns with the idea that proper orientation is key to 
achieving success in any endeavor. Just as professionals like medical officers or teachers 
undergo training for efficiency, couples benefit from structured marriage education comprising 
lectures, audio-visual aids, discussions, and role-playing exercises, which provide insights into 
establishing a stable marital foundation46.  
Hohman, Larson, and Harmer emphasize the importance of premarital assessment in preventing 
post-marital conflicts, advocating for thorough evaluations and critical examinations of potential 
problem areas in marriage, as suggested by biblical passages like Matthew 18:15-17 and 
Colossians 3:13. Hohman, Larson, and Harmer emphasize the importance of premarital 
assessment as a prerequisite for successful marriages. They suggest conducting thorough 
evaluations, including health assessments to ensure physical well-being and prevent sexually 
transmitted diseases. Additionally, couples are encouraged to critically evaluate potential

problem areas such as relationships with friends, family, in-laws, religious beliefs, values, 
finances, child-rearing practices, and intimacy. Addressing these issues before marriage can 
prevent conflicts that might escalate post-marriage.  
Another goal highlighted by Holman, Larson, and Harmer is to normalize seeking professional 
help for future marital or family issues. This is crucial, especially in the Ugandan context where 
seeking professional assistance for marital challenges is not yet widely accepted. Often, couples 
either keep their problems private until they escalate or seek advice from biased sources like in-
laws and friends, leading to further complications in their marriages. Encouraging couples to 
seek professional help promotes healthier communication and resolution of issues before they 
spiral out of control. 
The researcher proposes implementing post-marital counseling within the church to provide 
ongoing support and guidance to couples. This approach, rooted in Ephesians 5:22, aims to 
reinforce Biblical teachings and address hidden marital challenges proactively. The researcher 
suggests implementing post-marital counseling within the church, extending support to couples 
for at least the initial year after marriage. This ongoing counseling and oversight aim to reinforce 
the importance of continuing to align with the teachings of the Bible. Essential aspects such as 
the roles of husbands and wives, as outlined in Ephesians 5:22, should be continually 
emphasized even after marriage. 
Ideally, the counselor who guided the couple through pre-marital counseling should maintain 
contact with them, visiting on a quarterly basis to assess their progress and address any emerging 
challenges in their home life. The researcher suggests that maintaining continuity with the same 
counselor raises trust and openness in the couple, facilitating more effective counseling sessions. 
The researcher emphasizes that many couples face secret challenges that neither the church nor 
the church leadership is aware of, leading to divorces before issues can be resolved. However, 
through the practice of post-marital counseling, these hidden issues could be brought to light and 
addressed. This approach seeks to prevent marital breakdowns by providing ongoing support and 
guidance to couples as they navigate the complexities of married life47.

4.7 Conclusion  
The church under study holds firm to the covenant concept of marriage, emphasizing its 
sacredness and permanence. While it does not overlook instances of divorce within marriages, 
significant marital challenges have been observed within the church community. To address 
these challenges, church ministers can take existing actions aligned with Biblical principles to 
reduce divorce rates and stand-in strong marriages. These actions include comprehensive 
counseling, marriage improvement programs, spiritual guidance, community support, conflict 
resolution training, positive role modeling, collaboration with other organizations, advocacy for 
healthy marriages and raising awareness about the impact of divorce. Such efforts will empower 
individuals to review their vows on divorce and strengthen their commitment to marriage. 
Furthermore, the church's mission extends beyond proclamation; it involves revealing God’s 
purpose for humanity and presenting Jesus as the source of true life and meaning. This mission 
compels Christians to actively live out their faith in their daily lives, addressing pressing issues 
such as divorce. For example, the church should collaborate with other organizations and 
professionals to offer comprehensive marriage support services, including access to qualified 
counselors, therapists, and legal advisors when needed. Working together as a united body of 
believers, as emphasized in Biblical teachings, the church can provide holistic support to couples 
and families. Additionally, the church should advocate for policies and programs that support 
healthy marriages and families, drawing from biblical principles of justice and compassion. By 
setting a positive example of a healthy marriage, make straight standards set and demonstrating 
commitment and perseverance as illustrated in the Song of Solomon, the church can 
meaningfully contribute.

CHAPTER FIVE 
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS. 
5.1 Conclusions 
The study as a whole looked at the divorce in the church’s role in limitation to the situation. 
Biblically, the study supports the unquestionable fact that God is the designer of marriage 
(Genesis 1:26-27). God made male and female in His own image, and His main purpose for 
marriage was for companionship. Throughout history, the beauty of marriage has been tarnished 
in all cultures by conflict, misunderstanding, resulting in marriage break ups. The study also 
emphasized the fact that the issue of divorce is very shocking and has now become a universal 
evil since it is found in all countries and cultures. In an attempt to address this issue, the study 
surveyed the scriptures to understand what it has to say about marriage and divorce from Genesis 
to Revelation and focusing on Matthew 19:3-9 as the key verse for the study. 
The study reviewed the Biblical background to the issues of marriage and divorce by looking at 
the teachings of Genesis, the prophets, Jesus and the apostle Paul. The Biblical background 
further shows how the Scripture continually upholds marriage as a sacred and permanent 
covenant, witnessed and protected by God. The study observed that marriage as a sacred 
covenant was effectively used in the Old Testament to portray God’s relationship with Israel and 
in the New Testament to represent Christ’s relationship with His church. If God used marriage as 
any image to represent His commitment to His people, then it accepts that He regards marriage 
as a sacred, permanent covenant relationship. Since the disaster of divorce has consequence not 
only on the couples but also on the children, the study also looked at its effects on children and 
the following were gathered: stigmatized children dropping out of school, prostitution, armed 
robbery, madness, premature death, murder, suicide, street children and juvenile crime, child 
abuse and financial difficulties. 
The research also examined how church is responding to the issue of divorce. It was realized that 
the church allocated three to six month for premarital counseling. There was no availability of 
post-marital counseling. It was also realized that it is only during wedding ceremonies or during 
annual celebration of family life week that teachings on marriage are presented from the pulpit. 
Again, it was found out that there was no programs for divorcees in the church since those who 
divorced did not stay in the church. Any developing counselors, deacons or deaconesses who are 

 
 
33 
 
committed to the vision and goals of the church are assessed and taken through training to 
become marriage counselors. It was realized that the church has been hit by the issue of divorce 
and some marriages in the church have ended up in divorce whiles others are also facing serious 
marital challenges. Since the church does not advocate for divorce, leaders who divorce are 
stripped off their leadership positions.  
The researcher affirms that the Biblical view of marriage as a sacred and permanent covenant, 
witnessed by God Himself, is crucial in responding to the secular marriage. From the researchers 
own examination it can be concluded that the divorce rate is on the control. Divorce rate is 
rampant among the young couples (those who marry in their early ages). It can also be concluded 
that more and more young people are getting married from the Pentecostal, Charismatic and 
Evangelical churches. Nevertheless, the churches have of divorce which is attributed by to 
western cultural lifestyle and peer pressure. For instance some follow the soap operas which give 
wrong picture about marriage and the young people think what they see in these films are real, 
and as such when these expectations are not met their marriages lead to divorce. The other 
factors that cause divorce include challenges in communication, bitterness, barrenness or 
childlessness, adultery, desertion or abandonment, persistent conflicts and abuse. 
From the researcher’s findings it has come to light that the church have to lay down plans and 
procedures in responding and dealing with the issue of divorce. Moreover, it is sad to say that a 
lot of pastors and marriage counselors are ill equipped to handle the issue of divorce in their 
congregations. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
34 
 
5.2 Recommendations 
Marriage is a sacred institution and should not be easily terminated by divorce. The rampant rate 
of which divorce has reached in our society is a reflection of how the sacredness of marriage has 
been dishonored. In order to uphold God’s standard of monogamous lifetime marriage, the 
researcher recommends the following:  
1. Pastors and church leaders should be well trained in the Word of God as marriage counselors. 
Pastors who have not had formal training should be encouraged to attend Bible Schools. The 
researcher believes that this will contribute to their knowledge and broaden their limit in the 
teaching of marriage. It will further help them to develop better understanding on certain key 
marital issues so that they can offer good counseling to people who find themselves in marital 
crisis. Church leaders should pursue courses in exegesis and hermeneutics in order to be well 
equipped for better and accurate interpretation of the Word of God, especially Scripture texts that 
deal with the issue of divorce.  
2. Churches must devote time to teach on marriage as they teach on topics such as salvation, 
transformation, blessing and so on. Most sermons on marriage are preached during wedding 
ceremonies and special marriage seminars. The subject of marriage and divorce should be taught 
more frequently in churches. 
3. The church must play a lead role in educating the youth and married couples on issues related 
to sex. Sex education in marriage must be given much attention during counseling. This will go a 
long way to help married partners to be satisfied with each other and to avoid extra marital 
affairs, thereby curbing the issue of divorce. This can clearly be seen from the assertion of the 
lawyer in charge of marriage and divorce at the end in divorce at their end is as a result of sex 
problem. 
4. Counseling should be taken more seriously in the Churches. Emphasis must be laid on both 
pre-marital and post-marital counseling and this should be done frequently. The researcher is of 
the view that the church should institute post-marital counseling whereby couples will continue 
at least for the first year to receive counseling and some over sight and to get couples to 
understand why they need to continue to submit to the Word of God. In this regard Christian 
marriage counselors in Ghana should develop marriage seminars at regular intervals where the 
marriage couples and ‘would be’ couples would come and learn more about the institution of 

 
 
35 
 
marriage, their prospective roles in marriage and the challenges in marriage. This could help 
identify and solve a potential issue that could lead to divorce. 
5. The youth should be taught and encouraged to establish themselves in their chosen professions 
before making marriage commitments so as to minimize the incidents of divorce among young 
couples.  
6. The high cost of marriage must be addressed by the church. This is because many marriages 
that have lasted long were not because the couples were rich. Making marriage simple and less 
expensive should be encouraged. 
7. Finally, the clergy should make it a point to encourage married couples to stay united in love, 
forgiving each other and living out the principles of marriage as enshrined in Scriptures. 
8. The high cost of marriage needs to be addressed by ministers and church leaders. This is 
because many marriages that have lasted long were not because the couples were rich. Making 
marriage simple and less expensive should be encouraged by the church. 
Nobody should put asunder in the marriage and the couples should together in the times of all 
conditions, being poor or rich, in good health conditions and sick, weather in the times of with or 
without anything the two should learn to live together.  
There is the need for the church to step out and be proactive to address this crisis in Christian 
marriages since the church is supposed to be the salt and light of the world.
