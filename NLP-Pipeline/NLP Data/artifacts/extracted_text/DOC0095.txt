ABSTRACT 
This project addresses the problem of high-quality potable water being used to 
carry out low quality tasks such as flushing in toilets and urinals by offering an 
affordable, yet environmentally friendly way of harnessing treated wastewater 
effluent for non-potable applications. This research aims to assess the raw quality 
(physicochemical and microbiological characteristics) of treated wastewater 
effluent from the UCU wastewater treatment plant and treat it with reference to 
how it complies with established reclaimed water standards for use in toilet and 
urinal flushing.  
Uganda Christian University (UCU) purchases large volumes of potable water from 
National Water and Sewerage Corporation (NWSC) on a monthly basis. This water is 
used to ensure smooth running university activities such as cleaning, cooking, 
drinking, and waste management. Studies show that about 20-40% of domestic 
water demand is consumed in toilet flushing and 50-70% of commercial water 
demand (Ilemobade et al., 2012).

CHAPTER ONE: GENERAL INTRODUCTION 
1.0 BACKGROUND 
Uganda Christian university is currently using high quality potable water for non-
potable use in toilet and urinals, irrigation leading to incorrection use of treated 
water consequently the university incurs a substantial burden due to its 
dependence on potable water supplied by national water and sewerage 
corporation. Over the last years, UCU spent between UGX 30million and UGX 40 
million per month on potable water, equivalent to approximately 6000 to 7000 
cubic meters monthly (Mangene, 2025) 
Implementation of a wastewater effluent reuse would reduce the demand of 
potable water hence enhance sustainable environment by reducing volume of 
treated effluent discharged to environment. 
UCU activated wastewater treatment plant was commissioned in 2006 the first 
facility of it is kind in Uganda, it handles wastewater generated from the university 
residences including cooking, cleaning, washing and human waste management.it 
waste constructed to support on decentralized waste management, wastewater 
from toilet, showers and laundry areas is processed through a treatment system 
consisting of solid waste removal biological decomposition and chlorination. 
Influent from campus activities is converted to treated effluent that is safe for 
discharge into environment. 
1.1.0 PROBLEM STATEMENT 
Uganda Christians university currently relies on potable water for non potale uses 
such as flushing toilets and urinal plus irrigation resulting to inefficient allocation 

2 
 
of quality water, as potable water is being used for task that do not reuire such 
standards the practice is unsustainable and contribute to unnecessary strains on 
the university`s water resources. UCU Has it`s financial burdens incurred to NWSC 
for low grade over a period of five years, ucu has consistently spent between thirty 
million to forty million with equal volume of treated water of 6000 cubic metre to 
7000 cubic meter monthly 
Implementation of a wastewater effluent reuse would reduce the demand of 
potable water hence enhance sustainable environment by reducing volume of 
treated effluent discharged to environment.

1.1.4 JUSTIFICATION 
INTRODUCTION 
Institutions typical have high demand on water usage leading to substantial 
economic burdens due to the large volumes of water required for daily operation, 
application .at Uganda Christian university, this challenge is intensified by the 
misallocation of high-quality drinking water paid to National water and sewerage 
corporation at a cost of 30 million-40 million with equal volume of 6000-7000 cubic 
m most of this water is used for sanitary use. As a result of significant and 
continuous increasing financial expense, limiting the effective and suitable 
management of its potable resources.to address the problem, the university must 
adopt an alternative water source capable of serving the non-potable appliances 
Globally, many institutions facing similar challenges have successfully implemented 
wastewater reuse system (PUB, 2014). The approach involves treated wastewater 
to acceptable standards for non-potable uses such as toilet flushing, landscape 
irrigation and industrial cooling of equipment. Wastewater reuse has proven 
effective inclosing the water loop and reducing dependence on potable water 
supplies. 
1.1.5 CONTENT SCOPE

reuse system for non-potable applications in Uganda Christian University. This 
study strives to treat and compare effluent produced by the Uganda Christian 
University activated wastewater treatment plant to the guidelines of treated 
wastewater effluent quality for non-potable use (toilet and urinal flushing).

CHAPTER TWO: LITERATURE REVIEW 
2.0 INTRODUCTION  
Review gives information on the current research on the use of wastewater 
effluent for non-potable applications such as flushing in toilets and urinals, 
irrigation, and cooling of machinery in industries to mention but a few.  
The treatment and reuse of wastewater effluent for non-potable applications is an 
admirable strategy used to conserve potable water supplies in urban areas. The 
initial stage is the treatment of the wastewater effluent to meet non-potable 
water quality standards for toilet flushing. This is to reduce the risk human 
contamination and user acceptance of the project. This can reduce the demand for 
potable water in a community (Pandey, 2022). When wastewater effluent is 
incorporated into waste management, there is a closed loop in which water is 
transformed from a discharged waste into a precious resource. 
2.1.1 Physicochemical and Bacteriological Characteristics Ucu Wastewater 
Effluent  
Ucu Effluent Quality  
Effluent quality refers to the chemical, physical, and biological characteristics of 
the effluent generated by the UCU wastewater treatment plant in regards to the 
intended use. For water to be acceptable for use by the population, there must be 
no risk of disease contraction by the users and an aesthetically acceptable outlook 
of the reused water. 
A total of six water quality parameters were selected for this study (PUB, 2014). 
They include: 

6 
 
a) Turbidity. 
The turbidity of effluent indicates the presence of suspended particles in the 
effluent. Filtration is type of treatment widely used to reduce turbidity of water. 
in this process, the wastewater effluent is passed through the porous medium to 
remove particulate matter (J. Shanthi Sravan, Leonidas Matsakas and Sarkar, 
2024). Membrane technologies used include; microfiltration and ultrafiltration 
which are used for advanced wastewater treatment because they are effective in 
removing micron sized particles.  
, preventing salt water (seawater) contamination and augmenting the region’s 
drinking water supply. Another technology widely used in wastewater filtration is 
sand filtration. Larger suspended particles like silt are physically trapped in the 
spaces or pores between the sand grains as wastewater trickles through sand 
layers. In addition, through the process of adsorption, small colloidal particles that 
pass through the sand’s pore spaces are trapped by adhesion on the surface of the 
sand grains. 
a) Color. 
Color is an important physical parameter that informs about the wastewater 
effluent composition, condition, and potential contaminants therein.  
In the treatment of wastewater effluent, chemical methods of treatment are often 
employed. The coagulation and flocculation processes are widely employed 
because they are highly effective in the decolorization of water (Ho, Chua and 
Chong, 2020). This involves the addition of chemical coagulants to destabilize the 
suspended particles and colored compounds in the wastewater effluent. 

7 
 
In the treatment of wastewater effluent, it is crucial to have a neutral pH. This is 
because extreme pH values are fatal to both aquatic life and cause damage to the 
piping and plumbing systems in place aimed towards the reuse of effluent (El-
Khateeb, Nashy and Nayl, 2020). 
The fundamental principal in pH correction is the addition of an acidic or basic 
chemical to adjust the pH of the wastewater effluent to a neutral range. For 
example, between 6.0 – 9.0. 
b) Total coliforms 
Total coliforms are a group of bacteria that are no exactly harmful, however their 
presence in wastewater effluent indicates the presence of certain disease-causing 
microorganisms. Total coliforms are found in all parts of the environment such as 
the soil, in vegetation, and in the guts of warm-blooded animals (Solomon 
Oluwaseun Akinnawo, Peter Odunayo Ayadi and Mathew Temitope Oluwalope, 
2023).  
Chlorine is widely used as a disinfectant because it disrupts the microbial cell 
membranes and inactive enzymes crucial for cell survival of the bacteria. The 
effectiveness of the chlorination by chlorine depends largely on the chlorine 
dosage, contact time, pH, and the presence of other interfering substances.  
c) Escherichia coli (E. coli) 
E. Coli is a common bacterium found in the intestines or gut of warm-blooded 
animals, including humans. The presence of e. coli in wastewater effluent 
indicates fecal contamination, and the presence of pathogenic microorganisms 

8 
 
that are a health risk to the public and to the environment (Pallavali, Shin and 
Choi, 2023).  
E. Coli and other pathogens can also be treated using chemical disinfection with 
chlorine disinfection being one of the most used methods. Another method is 
ozonation where ozone, a powerful oxidant and disinfectant is used to inactivate 
microorganisms. In some cases, ozonation is preferred because of its ability to 
disinfect without forming harmful disinfection byproducts (Solomon Oluwaseun 
Akinnawo, Peter Odunayo Ayadi and Mathew Temitope Oluwalope, 2023).  
d) BOD5  
Biochemical oxygen demand over 5 days is an important parameter to determine 
the quality of the wastewater effluent. The concentration of BOD5 in water is 
indicative of the level of organic pollution present in the water. It is used to 
quantify the amount of dissolved oxygen consumed in the decomposition of organic 
matter by microorganisms (Maddah, 2022). Presence in organic pollutants in 
wastewater effluent increases the risk to human health if this effluent is reused 
for toilet flushing. 
2.1.2 Case Studies of Implemented Wastewater Effluent Reuse Systems 
Water Factory 21, Orange County California 
Water factory 21 is a large-scale ground water recharging facility located in 
Fountain Valley, Orange County California. It was founded by the Orange County 
Water District to augment and protect the scarce groundwater aquifers from 
seawater intrusion. The ground water aquifers in Orange County faced a problem 
of the drop of groundwater levels caused by the over excavation of groundwater 

9 
 
and the intrusion of seawater into the aquifers. The solution employed is the use 
of municipal sewage effluent generated by approximately 2.5 million residents to 
recharge the groundwater aquifers. The first objective was to treat the secondary 
effluent to a high quality for injection in to the ground (OCWD, 2018).  
A tertiary treatment train was used to treat the secondary effluent which involved 
lime clarification, carbon adsorption, reverse osmosis, and chlorination as a multi-
barrier treatment train. This treatment was focused on meeting drinking water 
quality standards. Injection wells were used to deliver the highly treated water 
into the aquifer, which then served as a natural storage and distribution reservoir 
Results showed that the Water Factory 21 provided a high-quality Groundwater 
Replenishment System, a supply system that can trace contaminants, and long-
term water security in a semi-arid region. 
2.1.3 Sembcorp NEWater plants, Singapore 
The Sembcorp NEWater plant is the world’s largest water reclamation plant 
operated by the Public Utilities Board of Singapore. It has a capacity of 228,000 
cubic meters per day. The challenge of water scarcity and national security have 
been vital in the driving of Singapore’s NEWater program which has been a vital 
initiative ever since its establishment because the country previously relied on 
imported water. Therefore, to diversify the nation’s water supply the scheme 
began to treat secondary effluent generated from the comprehensive sewerage 
network of the Island known as the Deep Tunnel Sewerage System (PUB, 2018). The 
non-potable applications considered are: flushing of water closets and urinals, 
general washing, irrigation, and cooling-tower make-up.  

10 
 
 
Figure 1: Sembcorp NEWater Plant in Singapore (Changi Water Reclamation Plant & 
Sembcorp NEWater Plant, 2023) 
The NEWater plants a treatment system that comprises of three stages to make the 
effluent reach non-potable water quality standards as per their PUB guidelines. 
They include:  
a) Microfiltration or ultrafiltration to remove suspended solids and colloids. 
b) Reverse osmosis to remove viruses and salts. 
c) Ultraviolet disinfection and chemical disinfection.  
NEWater facilities produce tens to hundreds of millions of gallons of water per day 
in aggregated capacity and significantly contribute to Singapore’s water supply. A 
single plant is reported to meet approximately 12% - 15% of the water demand. 
The reported output it was discovered to have a very high microbial and chemical 
quality suitable for industrial reuse and other non-potable applications. 
The distribution system comprises of a ‘purple pipe’ system that is used to deliver 
the treated effluent to the industrial facilities and the other non-potable water 
applications (Opening of Singapore’s Fifth and Largest NEWater Plant, The 
Sembcorp NEWater Plant, 2025). 

11 
 
The system design and selection went on as follows. After the characterization of 
the wastewater effluent to be reused, the data collected was used to identify 
worst case loads, typical loads, seasonal loads, and shock loads. This enabled PUB 
to clearly define the feedwater quality. Afterwards, the boards used removal 
performance data for the candidate treatment technologies of interest (membrane 
filtration, reverse osmosis, ultraviolet disinfection, and advanced oxidation) which 
they often obtained from pilot plants, such as the 2000 full-scale demonstration 
plant which would establish the suitable treatment train to achieve their desired 
water quality. To set the target water quality, PUB referenced WHO and the US EPA 
to attain high water quality standards. The board created mass balance and 
removal requirements for each contaminant as well as calculated log reductions 
that the treatment process must achieve to produce the desired water quality of 
the effluent.  
Informed by the pilot and baseline data, PUB selected the three-stage treatment 
train for NEWater mentioned above. 
Arizona State University (ASU) Tempe Campus, USA 
The Tempe Campus once faced the problem of heavy reliance on municipal water 
sources for non-potable applications which resulted in high operational costs and 
the need for water independence in an arid climate. The solution employed was 
the establishment of a wastewater effluent reusing system to offset the cost 
incurred due to the use of clean water for non-potable applications. The effluent is 
generated by the campus community (students, faculties, and staff residents) and 
nearby community (Tortajada, 2014). 

12 
 
The wastewater is obtained from the municipal secondary treatment plant back to 
the wastewater effluent reclamation plant on the Tempe Campus. The treatment 
methods used are typically sand filtration and chlorination to meet the strict 
health standards for non-potable uses. The distribution system employed consists 
of color-coded pipe networks (purple pipes) constructed within the campus 
grounds to distribute the treated wastewater effluent to large landscaping 
irrigation systems, athletic fields and most importantly, toilet and urinal flushing in 
academic buildings.  
Coastal Metropolitan Area Schemes - Catalonia Spain 
A Barcelona coastal metropolitan reuse scheme was developed to address seasonal 
water scarcity. In addition, they were also developed to reduce pressure on surface 
water and groundwater sources and to prevent seawater intrusion in the LIobregat 
delta aquifer. The scheme sources secondary effluent from the metropolitan 
wastewater treatment plants. The end uses of the effluent include agricultural 
irrigation, wetland restoration and the prevention of seawater intrusion through a 
barrier.  
To meet district end-use water quality standards, the schemes use a four-stage 
treatment system. That is to say, filtration, advanced biological and chemical 
treatment, and finally disinfection. For the distribution system, bulk conveyance 
pipelines, pumping stations, and reservoirs designed to meet seasonal peak 
demands as well as the need to meet the intrusion barrier (Mujeriego et al., 2008).  

13 
 
 
Figure 2: A Reclaimed water pumping station for instream flow and agricultural 
irrigation (Mujeriego et al., 2008). 
Treatment Of Wastewater Effluent to Meet Non-Potable Water Quality 
The tested parameters that did not meet the Singapore PUB guideline quality for 
non-potable water for toilet and urinal flushing are, turbidity, E. Coli, Total 
coliforms. This necessitates the use of a sequence of treatment units to polish the 
effluent and disinfect it to reduce the risk of microbial contamination of the users 
of the effluent reuse system.  
To select the appropriate treatment method, the following were taken in to 
careful consideration; 
a) What is the current quality of the effluent? 
b) What is the target effluent quality? 
c) What adjustment is desired in the effluent? 
d) What sequence of unit processes is most suitable to achieve the desired 
effluent quality? 
 

14 
 
Turbidity 
To polish the effluent and remove reduce its turbidity, a filtration unit is proposed 
to make the effluent more aesthetically acceptable.  
Filtration in the process of physically removing suspended particles, solids, and 
other fine particles from a liquid as it passes through a permeable barrier or a 
porous medium that retain these particles and allow the liquid filtrate to pass 
through the filter medium (Yogafanny et al., 2020). 
To select the type of filtration to be employed, the following technologies were 
identified and assessed basing on their capabilities, viability, and availability in 
Uganda 
Figure 3: A flow chart showing the unit process technologies for removal of 
particulate matter from treated wastewater effluent (Metcalf & Eddy Inc. et al., 
2014). 
2.1.4 Depth filtration 
This is a physical unit process that involves the physical removal of particulate 
matter and colloidal solids to a small extent from liquids passed through granular 
filter media. Depth filters operate by straining, sedimentation, interception, 
impaction, and adsorption (Metcalf & Eddy Inc. et al., 2014). A depth filter is the 
proposed treatment unit for polishing the wastewater effluent because of the 
principal mechanisms by which it operates.

ultrafiltration

15 
 
The principal mechanisms by which depth filters remove particulate matter 
include;  
a) Straining: where particles larger than the pores in the medium are trapped 
mechanically (Jiang et al., 2021). 
b) Sedimentation: where heavy particles in the liquid settle on the filter 
medium. 
c) Interception: when particulate matter in the liquid being filtered comes into 
contact with the surface of the filtering medium as is moves in a streamline. 
d) Adhesion: which occurs when particles become attached to the surface of 
the medium as they pass through the filter.  
e) Flocculation: occurs in the interstices of the filter medium where larger 
particles form due to the velocity gradients of the liquid as it is being 
filtered. Afterwards the particles are removed by any one of the above 
mechanisms.  
2.1.5 Estimating the performance of a depth filter in the reduction of the turbidity 
of wastewater secondary effluent. 
To determine whether a depth filter will be effective in the polishing of effluent 
from the UCU AWWTP, the following equation was employed to estimate whether 
the filtrate turbidity would meet the required turbidity quality of <2NTU. 
Filter effluent turbidity, NTU = 0.5 NTU + 0.2 (Filter influent turbidity, NTU) 
(Metcalf & Eddy Inc. et al., 2014) 
 
 

16 
 
From the above calculation, a depth filter cannot achieve the desired turbidity 
(<2NTU). This could mean that either a depth filter is not an appropriate 
technology for this treatment, or another treatment unit can be employed to 
reduce the effluent turbidity before it is fed into the depth filter. 
 
Figure 4: A flow chart showing options for the reduction of effluent turbidity 
Theoretically, a second depth filter can reduce the effluent turbidity to a level 
that can be polished by a primary depth filter that meet the turbidity limit of 
<2NTU as shown in the calculation below.

Comment 
Filter effluent turbidity, NTU 
= 0.5 NTU + 0.2 * 7.48 NTU 
= 0.5 NTU + 1.496 NTU

Filter effluent turbidity, NTU = 
0.5 NTU + 0.2 (Filter influent

E. COLI AND TOTAL COLIFORMS 
To protect human health, the microbiological characteristics (E. Coli and total 
coliforms) will have to be treated to acceptable levels according to the Singapore 
Public Utilities Board non-potable water quality guidelines for toilet flushing.  
The first step is to reduce the turbidity of the effluent because harmful pathogens 
can hide within the particles and suspended solids present in effluent rendering 
the disinfection ineffective.  
Identified disinfection technologies include; 
Chlorine dosing: dosing with chlorine involves the variation of dosage and contact 
time in order to determine the optimum dose that meets the chlorine demand in 
the effluent. This also entails determining the amount of residual chlorine required 
to continue disinfecting the non-potable water in the distribution lines. 
For the purpose of disinfection, chlorine dosing will be employed in this research 
because it is a technology already in place at the UCU activated wastewater 
treatment plant to disinfect wastewater effluent. 
Ultraviolet radiation (UV): This is a type of technology that is employed to 
deactivate disease causing microorganisms by damaging their genetic makeup. 
When ultraviolet light is incident on the cells of microorganisms, it damages the 
nucleic acid, i.e. DNA and RNA, which are necessary for their reproduction and 
multiplication (Pecson et al., 2020).  UV radiation kills all types of pathogens 
including viruses, protozoa, and bacteria. It is usually used in the disinfection of 
drinking water, wastewater, and water to be reused for various applications. 

18 
 
Factors to be considered for UV dosing for effective disinfection include; the 
exposure time of water to the radiation, the availability of  
a) Water quality: Ultraviolet disinfection is only effective in water or 
wastewater effluent that has a low concentration of suspended solids, 
turbidity, and color (PUB, 2014).  
b) UV transmittance 
c) Residual disinfectant: UV disinfection does not provide residual disinfectant 
in the wastewater effluent. This necessitates the need for a chemical 
disinfectant such as chlorine to inhibit the growth the distribution system.

CHAPTER THREE: METHODOLOGY 
3.0 INTRODUCTION 
The reuse of treated wastewater (effluent) for non-potable applications (toilet 
flushing in particular) is a sustainable water conservation and resource 
management strategy. This chapter serves to provide an academic and scientific 
rationale for selecting key parameters to determine the physical, chemical, and 
biological parameters for the quality assessment of UCU’s effluent which is 
intended to be reused for toilet flushing. The selected parameters are relevant to 
guaranteeing the safety, aesthetic acceptability, and long-term viability of a water 
reusing system. The selection is justified by their impact on human health, system 
longevity, and user acceptance.  
There is no single, universal standard for non-potable water quality for flushing 
toilets. Instead, the standards for water reuse vary widely from country to country 
and are regulated by a "fit-for-purpose" approach, i.e., water quality is managed 
to be safe to use and to pose no hazard to public health and the environment. 
Given that this research is taking place in Uganda, a country that experiences 
tropical climate and tropical weather patterns, the Singapore non-potable water 
standards for toilet and urinal flushing will be used to ensure the treated effluent 
meets public health standards for Uganda’s climatic conditions. Singapore is 
located near the equator which results in a tropical climate with high 
temperatures and high humidity all year-long (Department of Statistics Singapore, 
2025).

3.1.0 Determining the Physicochemical and Bacteriological Characteristics of 
Raw Ucu Effluent. 
Effluent discharged into water or on land by any establishment must be treated 
based on the best practicable means, that is to say, environmentally sound 
practice and in compliance with the relevant guidelines (Standards for Discharge of 
Effluent into Water or on Land Regulations, 1999).  National Environment 
Management Authority 
Procedure for sample collection 
1. Prepare the necessary equipment and apparatus for the field work. This 
includes sample collection containers and gloves. The containers are 
cleaned using distilled water to prevent any contamination of the raw 
sample.  
2. The UCU AWWTP (sampling location) is then accessed with clearance from 
the plant operator. This is to ensure all project activities are authorized and 
do no cause alarm to the concerned officials of the plant. A 1.5L 
representative sample was obtained from the effluent discharge point in the 
UCU AWWTP. This procedure was repeated twice, once in the afternoon and 
once in the evening monitor any variation with in the day.  
3. The sample was then transported to the UCU Environmental Quality Lab in a 
cooler box to protect it from sunlight.  
3.1LABORATORY TESTS 
3.1.0 Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD5) 
BOD5 is a measure of the amount of dissolved oxygen in water required by 
microorganisms to aerobically breakdown (oxidize) organic matter present in a 

21 
 
water sample with in a given period of 5 days. BOD concentration is indicative of 
the extent of organic pollution of the water or effluent in the case of this 
research. Water with a high BOD indicates a high concentration of organic 
pollutants. 
Procedure  
1. Collect raw effluent samples in clean sterilized containers. 
2. Two BOD bottles were obtained and cleaned with distilled water. 
3. 300ml of the collected samples were added into 2 BOD bottles. One for 
afternoon sample and another for evening sample. 
4. 50ml of Sodium thiosulphate solution were added into each BOD bottle. The 
bottles were then shaken gently to evenly mix the solution. 
5. Using a syringe, 1ml of manganese solution, sodium solution, and 
concentrated sulfuric acid were each added to the two samples in the BOD 
bottles and they are gently shaken to create a homogeneous solution. 
6. The bottles are then left to settle for about 2 minutes.  
7. Using a measuring cylinder, 100ml of each sample is added into a conical 
flask each.  
8. Place each of the conical flasks under a burette and read off the initial 
readings of the sodium thiosulfate solution in the burette. Titrate sodium 
thiosulfate into each of the conical flasks until the solutions become 
colorless. 
9. Read and record off the final burette reading. 
10. Incubate the two BOD bottles at 35oC for 5 days. 
11. After five days, repeat the procedure from step 5 to step 9. 

22 
 
12. The BOD5 result is then calculated using the burette reading obtained. 
The collected samples were taken to the UCU Environmental Quality Lab to 
determine the physicochemical and bacteriological characteristics of the raw 
effluent from the UCU wastewater treatment plant. The parameters were selected 
based on the Public Utilities Board (PUB), of Singapore because this country 
experience tropical climates like Uganda, with no distinct seasons like winter and 
summer, but rainy and sunny weather all year long with high temperatures and 
high humidity (Department of Statistics Singapore, 2025). 
source of the effluent i.e. toilets and bathrooms in the halls of residence, staff 
quarters, lecture blocks, public sanitary facilities and the Janani Lowum dining hall 
in UCU.  
3.1.1 COLOR  
The effluent color is an aesthetic parameter that quantifies color imparted into 
water by dissolved substances (true color) and suspended materials (apparent 
color), indicating potential contamination and aesthetic issues (Omer, 2019). User 
perception is greatly dependent on the color of the effluent.  
Procedure 
1. The raw effluent sample is collected and inspected for its apparent color.  
2. The effluent samples’ color is determined using an optical apparatus by 
filling a blank with the sample until the bottom of the meniscus reaches the 
bottle’s mark. 
3. After inserting the blank into the apparatus, the read button is pressed. The 
color reading is taken and then recorded. 

23 
 
3.1.2 pH value  
pH is the measure of how acidic or how basic the effluent is on a scale of 0 to 14.  
The pH of the effluent is critical for the effectiveness of other treatment measures 
such as chemical disinfection through chlorination. pH also influences the potential 
for corrosion of pipes and fixtures.  
Procedure  
1. A standard buffer solution with established pH values was used to calibrate 
the pH meter. 
2. The pH meter was used to determine the pH values of the raw effluent 
sample, then results were read and recorded.  
1. The petri dishes are then incubated at 36oC for 24 hours.  
2. After 24 hours had elapsed, the petri dishes were removed from the 
incubator colonies were counted. The number of colonies formed was then 
taken as the E. Coli colony count.  
3.1.3 Total coliforms  
Measuring total coliform concentration in wastewater effluent is significant as they 
are a composite parameter of water quality and treatment efficiency. While E. coli 
particularly points towards fecal contamination, the total coliform group consists 
of bacteria from a more diverse array of environmental sources such as soil, plant 
material, and putrefying organic matter.  Total coliforms are largely harmless, but 
their existence shows there is a pathway present for more dangerous pathogens to 
enter the system. 
 

24 
 
Procedure 
1. A culture media is prepared by mixing 2.55g of violet red agar in 100ml of 
distilled water, and boiled for 2 minutes with continuous mixing until it 
completely dissolves. Sterilized petri dishes are then filled with the agar 
and allowed to settle so that the agar cools and solidifies. 
2. The components of the membrane filtration are autoclaved to sterilize them 
and assembled afterwards. 
3. The collected effluent sample is well shaken and 100ml of the sample is 
poured into the funnel. 
4. After filtration, the sterilized forceps were used to place the filter paper in 
a violet red agar plate and then covered and labeled with the sample name.  
5. The petri dishes are then incubated at 36oC for 24 hours.  
6. After 24 hours of incubation, the petri dishes were removed from the 
incubator and the number of colonies formed are counted and considered as 
the total coliform result. 
3.1.4 E. coli  
3. 2.55g of MacConkey agar is mixed with 100ml of distilled water and boiled 
for 2 minutes with continuous mixing to ensure all the agar is dissolved into 
the water. 10ml of the agar is then poured into sterilized petri dishes and 
allowed to cool. 
4. The membrane filtration apparatus is then placed into an autoclave to 
sterilize them and assemble them afterwards. 
5. The raw effluent sample is thoroughly shaken and 100ml of the sample is 
measured and poured in the funnel in the membrane filter. 

25 
 
6. After filtration, the funnel was removed and membrane filter paper was 
transferred to the MacConkey agar in the petri dishes using sterilized 
forceps. 
7. The MacConkey agar plates are then covered and labeled with sample name.  
3.1.5 TURBIDITY  
Turbidity is a measure of the clarity of the effluent indicating the presence of 
suspended particles such as silt, sludge and inorganic matter. Turbidity is critical in 
this study because suspended solids in the effluent can create a hiding place for 
pathogens, protecting them from disinfection treatment methods such as 
ultraviolet (UV) light. The turbidity of raw effluent was measured using a 
turbidimeter instrument and the SI units are NTU (Nephelometric Turbidity Units). 
Procedure  
1. Using a standard calibration solution with known turbidity values, the 
turbidimeter is calibrated. 
2. The raw effluent sample is collected from the effluent discharge point. 
3. The effluent sample is then placed in a turbidimeter which determines the 
turbidity by measuring the degree at which light is scattered at 900 by 
suspended particles.  
4. The result is then read and recorded from the turbidimeter in 
Nephelometric Turbidity Units.

The sampling location is UCU Wastewater treatment plant in Mukono. The purpose 
of this sampling was to determine the characteristics of raw effluent which will 
inform the type of treatment required to meet the non-potable water standards 
for toilet flushing identified (Technical Guide for Greywater Recycling 1 st Edition: 
V2-Sep 2014). These guidelines were established to aid in the recycling of 
greywater for non-potable applications such as toilet and urinal flushing, general 
washing, irrigation, and cooling tower make up water.

CHAPTER FOUR: RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
4.1 INTRODUCTION  
secondary data was obtained from the UCU activated wastewater treatment plant 
office to help compare the parameter quality of the effluent. This information 
contained data collected on several parameters to determine the compliance of 
the plant to the National Standards for Wastewater effluent discharge into the 
environment from 2014 to 2023. three parameters (BOD5, E. Coli, and pH) in the 
secondary data are considered in this study and not all months of the years in that 
period are accounted. 
Effluent samples were collected at two different times: afternoon (2pm), and 
evening (4pm). The key parameters tested were pH, turbidity, color, E. coli, total 
coliform, and BOD5.  The findings were guided by the Singapore’s Public Utilities 
Board's Technical Guide for Greywater Recycling (PUB, 2014), which was selected 
because it gives the non-potable water quality requirements for toilet and urinal 
flushing.  
4.1.0 Physicochemical and Bacteriological Characteristics of Raw Effluent from 
The Ucu Wastewater Treatment Plant. 
The parameters of interest are turbidity, pH, color, E. coli, total coliforms, and 
BOD5. These parameters will be monitored before treatment, after treatment and 
during distribution of the effluent.  
The standards and guidelines considered for this study are the National 
Environment Standards-for Discharge of Effluent into Water or Land and the 
Singapore Public Utilities Board (PUB) guidelines. They are contrasted with the 
obtained lab results as follows. 

28 
 
TURBIDITY 
Turbidity is the measure of the cloudiness or haziness of the effluent caused by the 
presence of suspended particles like silt, clay, and organic matter. It is measured in 
Nephelometric Turbidity units (NTU).  
Secondary data obtained from the activated AWWTP did not provide information 
regarding the turbidity of the effluent. 
the turbidity value was found to be 18.2 NTU In the afternoon and was 34.9 NTU.  
the evening value This result is typical of secondary effluent which has not gone 
through tertiary treatment like filtration. The effluent turbidity values do not 
comply with the Singapore PUB guidelines, (<2 NTU). This might be an indication of 
an upset or hydraulic surge in the wastewater treatment process.  
For the atmospheric conditions, there was a rain storm before the evening sample 
was collected which might have resulted in disturbance of the wastewater in the 
wastewater treatment plant, resulting raising of any settled particles in the de-
sludging chamber. This therefore explains why the evening turbidity value is higher 
that the afternoon value. 
The turbidity results support the necessity for filtration, specifically sand filtration 
given the high levels of turbidity. Reducing the turbidity of the effluent will 
prevent suspended particles from shielding pathogens from applied disinfectants 
such as chlorine.  
 
 
 

29 
 
TOTAL COLIFORMS (TC) 
Total coliforms are group of bacteria indicating the general microbiological quality 
of water, rod shaped organism found widely in the environment (soil, plants) 
intestinal tracts of warm-blooded animals. 
The total coliform counts recorded 276CFU/100ml in the afternoon and 
95CFU/100ml in the evening showing the lower count in the evening than to the 
afternoon may be attributed to the dilution effect of rainfall. 
BIOCHEMICAL OXYGEN DEMAND BOD5 
Represent the amount of oxygen dissolved by aerobic microorganisms to break 
down organic matter in a sample water over a period of five days. the BOD5 value 
for afternoon and evening where within the limit according to Singapore PUB limit 
of <5mg/L meeting the environmental standards for effluent discharge and 
compliance with UCU wastewater treatment plant in removing soluble organic 
pollutants. 

30 
 
 
Figure 5: trend over seven-year period 
BOD5 concentration shows the extents of organic pollution in water. BOD5 levels in 
effluent sample indicate a presence of organic matter from wastewater this allows 
insight into how effective treatment system is removing organic particle. 
treatment process, organic matter is reduced through the action of aeration where 
blowers are introduced into wastewater to provide air to promote aerobic 
microbial breakdown of the loaded organism in the effluent likely to originates 
from students’ residence and quest quarters, DH and campus offices where organic 
discharged into toilets and food rests flushed into the system. 
COLOR 
 The clarity of the water is determined by Color, any total suspended particles 
change the color of water is the water quality parameter which refers to the 
presence of dissolved or suspended substances that cause water to appear 
discolored. 
the afternoon results were 8 PtCo in and 2.3 PtCo in the evening. These both 
complied with the PUB guidelines of <15 PtCo. A low color indicates a low

concentration of organic compounds that may make water or effluent dirty and 
unappealing observation affecting public acceptance.  
ESCHERICHIA. COLI (E. Coli)  
E. coli is indicator used to assess the microbiological quality of wastewater 
effluent, its presence fecal contamination. According to PUB guidelines, treated 
wastewater must be zero E. coli in a 100ml sample (PUB, 2014). These stringent 
standards exist because, although E. coli its self is generally not pathogenic, serves 
as dependable indicator of the possible harmful fecal origin of pathogens like 
salmonella therefore detecting E. coli sign of treatment process has not fully 
eliminate fecal contamination. 
Microbial count from effluent show that contamination from human waste while E. 
coli colony counts are lower than those in raw sewage indicating that some 
pathogens are removal during treatment, they are capable of exceeding the limits. 
The afternoon sample recorded 385 CFU/100ml, evening 334 CFU/100ml both are 
not meeting guideline 

32 
 
 
Figure 6: E. Coli trend over seven-year period 
In the secondary data, the E. Coli levels were significantly higher on 16th April, 
2020. In this period, the world was struck by the COVID-19 virus. The President of 
the Republic of Uganda initiated a lockdown in the country from 30th March to 30th 
June (Katana et al., 2024). The very high level of E. coli detected in the effluent 
on 16th April, 2020 could be a result of the scaling down of the wastewater 
treatment plant operations because the operators were either at home or had 
limited access to the premises. 
pH VALUE 
pH measures the acidity or alkalinity of the effluent by indicating the 
concentrations of hydrogen ions. the pH scale ranges from 0-14, with 7 
representing neutral value, values below 7indicate acidity while above 7 indicate 
alkalinity. 
The measured effluent pH value of 9.1 in the afternoon and 9.2 in the evening fall

required range, dosing with sulfuric acid is necessary to slightly reduce pH. pH 
levels are likely to be influenced by alkaline cleaning products used in residence 
halls and staff houses and detergents as well as food waste from kitchens. 
Secondary data indicates that over the past seven years, the effluent pH has 
generally remained within the acceptable limits set by the Singapore PUB for non- 
potable water used in toilets flushing. (6.0-9.0) 
From 18`th/November 2023 -15`th February 2025 effluent PH consistently 
remained within the range of 6-8. Data shows that the effluents the effluent was 
more acidic which may have resulted from the use of acidic cleaning products and 
disinfectants in campus toilets and bathrooms such as hydrochloric acid (HCL) the 
recent primary data shows that the effluent is slight alkaline suggesting increased 
use of alkaline compounds like sodium carbonate which elevate the pH

4.1.1 Effluent treatment. 
According to parameter tested, most of the parameters did not meet the guideline 
standards, turbidity, color, total suspended solids PH, total collide forms and E-
coli. The suggested treatment process would be slow sand treatment think the 
rationale of the above can fall within the treatment mechanism incorporated with 
the plain sedimentation to allow for pretreatment and sludge settlement before 
discharging to the filters that may clog with the short time. 
Required parameters for the treatment process are flow rate of the effluent 
(Qm3/day) per day, surface area (A m2), filtration rate/day, filtration velocity, sand 
depth, filter bed volume sand porosity, contact time and pore volume. 
Designing a wastewater treatment system.  
Depth filtration: will involve the physical removal of suspended particles from the 
secondary effluent passed through a granular filter media.  
Mechanisms: straining, sedimentation, interception, adhesion, and flocculation. 
Effectiveness of depth filtration.

and staff whose sanitary appliances are connected to existing wastewater 
treatment of UCU. 
effluent from the UCU wastewater treatment plant is used as treated pilot- scale 
horizontal subsurface constructed wetland. Once the quality of the effluent meets 
the target parameters for non- potable reuse, a dual-pipe water system will be 
installed to supply the recycled water for flushing toilets, urinals and for irrigation. 
(Mosher, 2015). 
According to Mosher (2015) design requirements, a separate reclaimed water 
distribution network should be developed to avoided cross contamination between 
potable water and non-potable water. The reused water will be conveyed from the 
clean water tank through outlet into a dedicated storage tank sized to hold a 
volume equivalent to at least 1.5 days of flushing demand. (Saudi Organisation for 
Standardization, Metrology and Quality, 2013). 
As recommended in the Handbook on Feasibility studies for water reuse system, 
backflow prevention devices and labelling at all outlets points will be part of the 
reuse system. A monitoring plan should encourage so that the treated water is in 
line with non- potable reuse standards taking a priority on parameters such as 
BOD, TSS coliforms, and turbidity. Continuous application of chlorine in the system 
to allow for periodic chlorination of the treated effluent to facilitate safe 
microbial quality during storage and transportation (New Zealand Water and 
Wastewater Association, 2002).
