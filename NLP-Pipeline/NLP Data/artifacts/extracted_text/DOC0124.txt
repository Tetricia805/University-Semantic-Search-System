ABSTRACT 
Soak pits remain the primary method of grey water disposal in many schools in Mukono.  
This method is effective for small volumes but inadequate due to the growing student 
population and expanding school activities thus leading to environmental risks like 
faster clogging and overflowing thus disease spreading. This research focused on 
identifying the quality and quantities of grey water in institutions specifically at St. 
Francis Borgia and going on to recover grey water as a valuable source that if recycled 
and reused for non-potable purposes like irrigation. 
Local and low cost materials were suggested to be used in grey water treatment and 
quartz sand filters showed promising results. Experiments were made with plain quartz 
sand and treated quartz sand and results showed higher percentage of contaminant 
reduction (between 40% and 80%) with treated quartz sand. Based on results, there was 
a suggestion of design of treatment unit using treated quartz sand for adsorption and 
filtration of grey water to ensure it meets standards for which it is treated for.

CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION  
1.1 BACKGROUND 
Grey water is the waste water from sinks, bathtubs, and washing machines, 
excluding sewage. The treatment and reuse of grey water is one of the biggest 
resource recovery and sustainable water use in institutions (Misra, 2020) 
Water scarcity and pressure on freshwater systems are the main reasons for 
increased sustainable water reuse in the world especially in cities that are rapidly 
growing. Globally, 50-70% of the total household wastewater is greywater, and the 
safe reuse of greywater has been considered one of the main measures for reducing 
the demand for freshwater (Eriksson et al., 2002). Greywater reuse has already 
become a necessity in water stressed areas such as the Middle East, South Asia, and 
East Africa for irrigation, landscaping and non-potable applications. Research in 
countries like India, Kenya, and Ethiopia indicate that untreated greywater is a 
major cause of nutrient loading, groundwater contamination and clogging of soil 
infiltration systems (Mbae et al., 2024). 
In Sub-Saharan African countries, mostly greywater is not treated before disposal 
because of the limited infrastructure, poor enforcement of environmental standards 
and the use of economical disposal methods like soak pits (Semiyaga et al., 2015). 
Increased student numbers lead to more greywater that soon surpasses the capacity 
of the existing systems. Thus, rapid clogging of soak pits occurs leading to overflow 
into yards and the increased BOD, COD, TSS, and nutrient concentrations reach 
surrounding soils and aquifers causing increase in vector and pathogens due to 
stagnancy (Matos et al., 2012). 

2 
 
 
Greywater from Africa is commonly rich in organic matter, phosphates coming from 
detergents and suspended solids. Research studies from East Africa have confirmed 
that wastewater of institutions usually exceed the discharge limits defined by WHO 
and the national standards (Niwagaba et al., 2021).  
Schools in Uganda generally produce greywater with high BOD (50-120 mg/L) mainly 
due to the presence of soaps and organic matter, high COD (100-250 mg/L), TSS over 
100 mg/L, and phosphates 3-10 mg/L particularly where commercial detergents are 
used (Niwagaba et al., 2021). 
Worldwide and regionally, low-cost filtration has been practiced with natural and 
modified sand, biofiltration, and adsorption media besides others. Iron-coated 
quartz sand (ICQS) has been identified as one of the best materials for phosphate 
and organic matter removal with proven scientific techniques, especially in 
detergent-based greywater (Xu et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2018). 
1.2 PROBLEM STATEMENT 
In many schools across Mukono District, soak pits are the primary method of grey 
water disposal. This method is effective for small volumes however it is inadequate 
due to the growing student population and expanding school activities. 
(Atwebembeire et al., 2019)  
St. Francis Borgia a secondary school in Mukono disposes its grey water into soak 
pits. In weekends when students are doing laundry, most of the laundry waste water 
is disposed in the compound and left to flow freely. Due to under designing and 

3 
 
increased volumes of grey water per day at the school (21cubic meters), the 
available soak pits are overloaded and end up clogging faster. 
According to Ugandan standards (MoH, 2018) Soak pits must receive only pretreated 
effluents, sized according to percolation test with depth (1.5-5m) and internal 
diameter (1-2.5m) 
However, construction designs of these soak pits were not to the standard ie no 
percolation test was done, depth was 1.3m and sizing (0.9m diameter) hence 
possible clogging and over flowing leading to environmental and health risks (KCCA, 
2022) 
Studies have shown that regardless of designs, soak pits are not viable and 
sustainable methods of grey water treatment for growing institutions that generate 
large quantities of grey water. (Semiyaga et al., 2015) 
Furthermore, the seepage of untreated grey water poses risks of contaminating 
groundwater sources used for domestic and institutional purposes. It is extremely 
difficult to eliminate the risk of ground water contamination when onsite sanitation 
systems effluent is discharged into sub surface. (Mbae et al., 2024) 
Preliminary tests were carried out and the presence of high BOD, COD, total 
suspended solids, and nutrients in untreated grey water exceeded recommended 
NEMA standards for discharge and reuse. Such pollution not only degrades the 
environment but also increases the risk of waterborne diseases within the school and 
surrounding communities. The current disposal methods fail to utilize grey water as 
a resource, despite its potential for reuse in irrigation thus missing an opportunity 
to conserve water. Experiments (batch and column) were made in the lab for both 

4 
 
plain quartz sand and treated quartz sand and it was found out that the treated 
quartz sand removes the highest percentage of contaminants in grey water due to 
large surface area for phosphates and organic matter. It was also found out that iron 
doesn’t leach into the treated grey water 
 
Iron-coated quartz sand filtration offers a promising approach due to its ability to 
enhance nutrient and organic matter removal. This study seeks to assess the 
performance of iron-coated quartz sand filters for treating grey water for reuse in 
institutions like St. Francis Borgia. 
1.3 Main Objective 
 To assess the use of iron-coated quartz sand in grey water treatment for reuse. 
1.3.1 Specific Objectives 
1. To assess the physical-chemical characteristics of grey water 
2. To determine the percentage reduction of contaminants by untreated quartz 
sand and treated quartz sand 
3. To design a grey water treatment unit with treated quartz sand 
1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS 
1. What are the physical-chemical characteristics of grey water? 
2. What percentage of contaminant removal can untreated and treated quartz 
sand achieve in treated grey water? 
3. What are permissible limits for grey water discharge into the environment 
and for various reuse options?

1.5 SCOPE OF STUDY 
St. Francis Borgia High school, Mukono 
1.6 JUSTIFICATION 
Iron-coated quartz silica sand has a high adsorption capacity of ferric oxides which 
bind contaminants like phosphate ions through electrostatic interactions as 
phosphate anions are attracted to the positively charged iron surface. (Liu et al., 
2018) This happens when iron oxides get positively charged under a low to neutral 
PH with a high variance, they are able to attract the negatively charged phosphate 
ions. 
Fe 3+ +PO4 3- == FePO4 + H2O 
Quartz silica sand has as a porous support material, hard and resistant to abrasion. 
It enhances flow and its large surface area enhances contaminant removal. Coating 
it with iron oxides significantly improves its adsorption efficiency. (Rusch et al., 
2010). In presence of oxygen and alkaline conditions, ferric oxides are stable thus 
insoluble in water. 
Its local availability and low cost, will provide a practical solution to promote water 
reuse and enhance sanitation in institutional settings hence reduction in fresh water 
consumption. There has been cases of water scarcity in institutions in Mukono as 
reported by Love Binti in 2023 thus this study can address this issue to some extent 
using locally available materials. 
 1.7 SIGNIFICANCE OF RESEARCH 
Environmental protection: This study provided a low-cost and eco-friendly solution 
to reducing pollution in grey water before it is discharged into the environment. 

6 
 
Public health concerns. By treating grey water, the risks of contamination and 
related diseases among school communities were reduced. For example, issues of 
water related diseases. 
Sustainable water management: Institutions will be empowered to recycle and reuse 
treated grey water for non-potable purposes, thus conserving fresh water resources. 
Scientific contribution: The research also contributed to scientific knowledge on the 
use of modified natural materials ie iron-coated sand in wastewater treatment. 
1.8 THEORETICAL/CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK 
The adsorption theory rooted in surface chemistry is the basis of this study. This 
theory states that attractions, either physical or chemical, between solid surfaces 
and pollutants, like phosphates in greywater, are the means for their removal. The 
iron coating over quartz sand brings in ferric oxides whose charges are positive and 
because of that they tend to associate with the negatively charged phosphate ions 
(PO4^3−) massively and most of the contaminants in grey water are negatively 
charged thus easy and fast interaction. The interaction causes the contaminants to 
stick to the media surface so they are removed from the water. The filtrate is then 
treated to eliminate any pollutant that might have evaded the adsorption process. 
COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS  
A cost benefit analysis was done to find out the benefit of incorporating a grey water 
treatment plant versus the cost of soak pits, fresh water consumption and use in 
irrigation and other non-potable purposes and it was found out that there are more 
cost benefits in treating grey water for non-potable purposes.

Population of the school and volumes of grey water generated  
St. Francis Borgia currently has a population of 1115 students and 85 staff members  
The school uses 27 m3 of water per day and assuming 78% of this waste water is grey 
water 
Volume of grey water generated per day=78/100x27= 21m3 
Volume of grey water generated per month= 21x30=630m3 
The school spends 8.3M USH on water per month  
Population growth projections in the next 20 years: 
Using the formula for population growth  
P(t)=Pi×(1+r)t 
P(t) = population after time t 
Pi = Initial population 
r= Annual growth rate (decimal form) = 0.029 
t = time in years 
P(t)= 1115(1+0.029)20= 1976 students calculated using standard design manuals for 
waste water treatment plants 
In the next 20 years, population projection is estimated to be 1976 students. Given 
that a student uses 18.6 liters of water per day, the total amount of grey water 
generated in the next 20 years is 37.2m3 

8 
 
This indicates that more volumes of grey water will be generated as population keeps 
increasing  
Calculating savings 
Savings= volume of treated grey water x cost of NWSC water per litre

CHAPTER 2: LITERATURE REVIEW 
2.1 WASTEWATER 
 This refers to used water that contains a mixture of both organic and inorganic 
material that is harmful to the environment (Shah, 2017). It simply means water that 
is not clean because it has been used in households, factories, runoff from farms, 
and others. Wastewater is polluted water, and its pollutants are from both point 
sources and dispersed sources (R L and Mehta, 2020). It is dangerous to the 
environment when released without treatment.  
Point sources: this simply means a single identifiable source of pollution for example 
drain or a pipe (usually industrial wastewater effluent being discharged by a pipe 
into a river) 
 Dispersed/ non-point sources: Also known as diffuse pollution simply mean inputs 
that happen over a large/ wide area and can be zeroed down to one source. They 
are usually attributed to a specific land use for example urban land use, Agricultural 
land use and factory land use and others. Diffuse pollution is executed by agents like 
storm water that greatly impact the water quality of the different waterways they 
flow into (EPA, 2021). Wastewater from the different sources affects the quality of 
surface and ground water. 
COMPOSITION OF WASTE WATER. 
• Nutrients like nitrates and phosphates 

10 
 
• Heavy metals like lead, mercury and copper 
• Bacteria and pathogens 
• Suspended solids 
• Detergents and soap residue. 
2.2 PARAMETERS MEASURED IN WASTE WATER 
Total Phosphorus (TP) 
TP measures all forms of phosphorus (organic and inorganic) in water. Excess 
phosphorus promotes eutrophication, leading to algal blooms, oxygen depletion, and 
aquatic ecosystem damage. It is often contributed by detergents, fertilizers, and 
sewage. Studies show that grey water contributes significantly to nutrient loading in 
local rivers (Niwagaba et al., 2021). 
Turbidity 
Turbidity refers to the cloudiness of water caused by suspended solids that scatter 
light. It is measured in Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU). High turbidity can 
indicate the presence of pathogens, organic matter, or pollutants and affects water 
clarity and quality. 
 pH 
pH measures the acidity or alkalinity of wastewater on a scale of 0 to 14. A pH of 7 
is neutral, below 7 is acidic, and above 7 is alkaline. pH affects biological processes, 
chemical reactions, and the solubility of pollutants. Wastewater should have a pH 
between 6.5 and 8.5 to be considered safe for discharge. 

11 
 
Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) 
BOD is the amount of dissolved oxygen needed by aerobic microorganisms to break 
down organic matter in water. It is an indicator of organic pollution. High BOD means 
more organic matter, leading to oxygen depletion in receiving water bodies. It is 
usually high in black water due to high organic matter from human fecal matter. 
Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) 
COD measures the total quantity of oxygen required to chemically oxidize all organic 
substances in water. High COD indicates the presence of significant organic and 
inorganic pollutants 
 Total Suspended Solids (TSS) 
TSS refers to the solid particles suspended in water that can be trapped by a filter. 
High TSS can reduce water clarity, hinder light penetration, affect aquatic life, and 
clog treatment systems. It includes silt, decaying matter, and industrial waste 
particles. 
Electrical conductivity 
Electrical conductivity in wastewater measures the water’s ability to conduct 
electricity, which depends on the concentration of dissolved ions such as salts (e.g 
sodium, chloride, sulfate, nitrate). It is expressed in µS/cm (micro siemens per 
centimeter). High EC indicates a high concentration of dissolved salts or ions from 
detergents and low EC indicates low salt content, meaning the water is less 
mineralized and relatively clean.

GREY WATER 
Grey water is form of waste water excluding sewage. It is waste water from the 
kitchen, laundry, washing utensils, showers and cleaning. This waste water is less 
contaminated compared to black water thus treatment is easier. 
Physical, chemical and microbiological quality of greywater  
Physical and chemical quality  
There is a high amount of variability in the chemical and physical quality of 
greywater produced by institutions, due to factors such as the source of water, the 
water use efficiency of appliances and fixtures, Individual habits, products used 
(e.g. detergents, shampoos, soaps,) and other site-specific characteristics.   

13 
 
The amount of salt (sodium, calcium, magnesium, potassium and other salt 
compounds), oils, greases, fats, nutrients and chemicals in greywater can largely be 
managed by the types of products used within an institution or community.  
Nutrients   
Greywater contains nutrients generated from the bathroom and laundry. By 
managing the type and amount of washing detergents, personal hygiene products 
and cleaning agents that are used, the amount of nutrients in greywater can be 
managed.   
Salts   
Salts in greywater originate from washing detergents and are commonly in the form 
of sodium, magnesium and calcium compounds. 
Why grey water is treated before disposal or reuse 
Treating grey water at household or institutional level reduces the volume and 
organic load entering centralized wastewater treatment plants, improving system 
efficiency and reduces expansion costs (NEMA, 2020). 
Protect Public Health. Untreated grey water contains pathogens such as bacteria 
and viruses that can cause infections. Chemical contaminants from detergents and 
pharmaceuticals also pose health risks (WHO, 2006) 
Environmental protection. Discharging untreated grey water contributes to 
eutrophication due to nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. It can also degrade 
soils and contaminate groundwater. 

14 
 
Resource recovery and circular economy. Treated grey water can be reused for 
irrigation and toilet flushing, reducing demand on freshwater supplies and 
supporting sustainable water management 
2.3 MATERIALS: QUARTZ SILICA SAND  
Quartz silica sand has the main chemical component of silicon dioxide (SiO2), which 
is a mineral that has a lot of remarkable features like very low reactivity with other 
chemicals, hardness, and that is why it comes in big granular sizes. One of the 
greatest properties of quartz is its high surface area and that is why it has found its 
place in the filtration systems as a filtering media. And since it is an inert material, 
it will not take part in the reaction going on with water or other substances, thus 
keeping the quality of the treated effluent. 
However, uncoated quartz silica sand has a low ability to hold up the pollutants 
mainly because of its negatively charged surface. For it effective with phosphate 
anions, it has to go through a surface modification by getting coated with metal 
oxides like iron. 
Iron specifically in the form of ferric oxides (Fe2O3, FeOOH) have a tendency to bind 
to phosphate ions. The surface of iron which carries a positive charge attracts the 
negatively charged phosphate ions (PO4^3-) thereby forming stable complexes. This 
phenomenon increases the phosphate extraction capacity. 
Iron coating has the additional advantage of increasing the number of active sites 
on the quartz surface, thus giving a boost to its adsorption efficiency. Research 
reports have confirmed that iron-coated sand can accomplish the removal of 
phosphate with an efficiency of up to 90% if conditions are made favorable. 

15 
 
Moreover, iron is economically priced, and non-toxic, thus, it becomes the perfect 
option for environmental water treatment. 
Generally, the procedure of coating involves immersing clean quartz sand in a ferric 
chloride solution, then drying and heating it to create a stable iron oxide layer on 
the sand grains. Not only does this process impart hardness to the filtration medium 
it is also suitable for both batch and column types of greywater treatment systems. 
The natural adsorption capacity of quartz sand is such a way that it quickly captures 
and gets rid of iron particles thus contributing not only to the water quality but also 
to the longevity of the water infrastructure. Its durability and effectiveness are 
expressed 
Procedure for preparation of iron coated quartz sand 
Dissolve 2M of ferric chloride in 80ml of distilled water and stir. Wash the sieved 
quartz sand thoroughly until clean water comes out to remove any kind of dirt. Dry 
the sand in an oven at 100degrees Celsius to ensure it dries properly. Mix the clean 
sand with the ferric chloride solution and stir. Prepare a 1M NaOH solution by 
dissolving 40g of NaOH pellets in 250ml of distilled water and then make up the 
solution to 1 litre. Slowly by slowly, add the NaOH in the mixture until optimum pH 
6-8 and soak for 1-2 hours. Ph is the most critical to determine the final structure, 
surface area and the stability of iron oxide coated sand. The FeOH precipitate forms 
directly on the sand surface and sand is separated from the mixture, washed with 
clean water and oven dried at 105 degrees Celsius.

2.4 GREYWATER USES  
Many research efforts have outlined the various potential uses of greywater. Among 
the most widely accepted applications are:  
•Toilet flushing and landscape irrigation. In the United States, greywater is most 
commonly used for watering landscapes, including lawns, ornamental plants, trees, 
and even certain food crops provided the water has been properly disinfected (Matos 
et al., 2012).  
•The application of greywater in toilet flushing has been encountered all over the 
Globe especially Europe (OMS, 2006).  
• Grey water is also used for general washing  
• Also used as a cooling tower make up water.  
Sources of grey water  
▪ Hand basins and washing dishes  
▪ Washing machines/laundry tubs, sinks, and water from washing clothes  
▪ Showers and baths etc.  
2.5 GREY WATER TREATMENT SYSTEMS  
Grey water does not typically produce unpleasant odors immediately after it is 
discharged. However, when stored in a tank without treatment, it rapidly depletes 
oxygen and transitions into an anaerobic state. In this condition, it becomes septic, 
forming sludge that may either sink or float depending on the amount of gas trapped 
within and its overall density. At this stage, greywater can emit foul smells similar 
to raw sewage and may also harbour anaerobic microorganisms, some of which are 
potentially pathogenic (Matos et al., 2012).  

17 
 
Therefore, effective grey water management requires prompt treatment and reuse 
before it turns septic. One of the simplest and most suitable approaches is to use 
freshly produced grey water directly, without allowing it to stagnate (Verstraete et 
al., 2009).  
2.6 GREYWATER TREATMENT METHODS 
There are many different approaches available for treating grey water (GWT) each 
varying in terms of how they operate the types of pollutants they target their design 
and the stages of treatment they involve. Choosing the right treatment method 
usually depends on several factors such as the amount of grey water being produced, 
how much organic matter it contains, what the treated water will be used for and 
the regulatory standards it must meet (Kulabako et al., 2009).  
Typically, grey water treatment is divided into three key stages: preliminary, 
primary and secondary treatment. Across the board, there is strong agreement that 
treatment methods should aim to be environmentally sustainable ideally avoiding 
harsh chemicals or the creation of toxic waste. While some studies suggest that grey 
water can be stored for a short time before treatment this period should be kept as 
brief as possible to prevent the growth of harmful microorganisms.  
Treatment techniques vary physical and chemical methods often involve filtration 
and disinfection, while biological processes might include aeration or the use of 
membrane bioreactors (Oteng-Peprah et al., 2018). Because they can create high 
quality treated grey water, sophisticated systems like sequencing batch reactors and 
biologically aerated filters are being used more and more all over the world.  

18 
 
However, these systems are less practical for low income or developing nations 
because of their high energy requirements and high installation and maintenance 
costs. 
The utilization of natural available resources as an alternative way is the main focus 
of this study due to these difficulties. These eco- friendly materials show promise 
for application in adsorption and filtration procedures providing efficient treatment 
without generating hazardous by products. 
 Pre-treatment 
Pretreatment techniques eliminate the bulk solids, hair, lint, sand, oil and grease as 
well as other materials that might interfere with the proper functioning of the 
equipment downstream and cause fouling. The pretreatment makes sure that filters, 
biological reactors, etc. are not clogged. It consists of screening, grit removal, and 
trapping of grease as unit processes.  
Primary treatment 
The technique discussed here makes use of sedimentation and similar physical 
processes to remove from the liquid waste the solid matter that can settle, thus 
reducing TSS and BOD levels (some). Primary treatment decreases the load on 
biological 
(secondary) 
processes. 
The 
most 
common 
processes 
include 
sedimentation, lamella or tube settlers and dissolved air flotation. 
Secondary treatment (biological and combined processes) 
This treatment method biologically removes dissolved and colloidal organic matter 
(BOD/COD), reduces pathogens and further reduces suspended solids. Secondary 
treatment transforms organic matter into biomass and, ideally, stable effluent that 

19 
 
is reusable or can be safely discharged. These processes consist of activated sludge, 
bio filters, constructed wetlands (nature-based systems that combine filtration, 
adsorption, and biological degradation). (Arden et al., 2018) 
Sedimentation in Grey Water Treatment 
Sedimentation is one of the simplest and most natural ways of cleaning grey water 
before it moves on to more advanced treatment steps. It works on a very basic idea 
if you give water enough time to rest heavier particles will slowly sink to the bottom. 
This simple action helps remove a big portion of the dirt and solids found in grey 
water from showers, sinks, and laundry. As grey water comes into the sedimentation 
tank, the water flow is reduced to allow the settling down of different kinds of debris 
such as soil, hair, soap and food particles. The sinking materials aggregate into a 
sludge layer on the floor of the tank. This sludge is to be removed at intervals to 
ensure the system remains clean and working efficiently. The water which is clearer 
than before now on the surface is then permitted to pass on to the following 
treatment stage. 
Sedimentation is especially useful because it can significantly reduce several 
parameters making the rest of the treatment process easier and more effective. 
Some of the main parameters reduced include total suspended solids and turbidity. 
Total Suspended Solids (TSS) 
 This is the biggest improvement achieved through sedimentation. Most of the solid 
particles settle out, often reducing TSS by a big percentage. 
Because the solids settle, the water becomes clearer. Turbidity may drop 
significantly. 

20 
 
Other parameters like BOD, COD and microbial load reduce slightly. They may be 
significantly reduced by biological processes.  
Factors that influence sedimentation efficiency 
▪ Retention time (1-3 hours) 
▪ Tank depth and type 
▪ Temperature 
▪ Particle size and density 
▪ Presence of surfactants 
Types of sedimentation tanks 
Circular sedimentation tanks 
The tanks are circular in shape and influent normally enters at the center and flows 
outward. Sludge is scraped to the center by rotating scrapers and effluent is 
collected at the edges via peripheral weirs. 
Advantages 
▪ Symmetrical flow patterns reduce dead zones. 
▪ Efficient sludge collection. 
▪ Suitable for large flow rates. 
▪ Continuous smooth operation of mechanical scrapers. 
Disadvantages 
▪ Require more land area. 
▪ Higher construction cost due to mechanical equipment. 
▪ Wind may disturb hydraulic efficiency. 

21 
 
▪ Harder to cover for odor control. 
 
Rectangular sedimentation tanks 
These are long straight channels with influent entering at one end and leaving at the 
other and sludge moves to the end through gravity or chain mechanisms they have a 
uniform horizontal flow. 
Advantages 
▪ Require less land area. 
▪ Hydraulically more efficient (straight uniform flow). 
▪ Easier to expand by adding parallel units. 
▪ Cheaper construction and maintenance. 
▪ Easier sludge removal. 
▪ Perform better during peak flows. 
Disadvantages: 
▪ Possibility of short-circuiting if poorly designed. 
▪ Sludge removal equipment needs periodic maintenance. 
▪ Inlet flow distribution must be well designed. 
Why rectangular tanks are often preferred 
▪ Use less land area for same capacity. 
▪ Better hydraulic efficiency. 
▪ Cheaper to construct. 
▪ Easier to operate and maintain. 

22 
 
▪ Allow easy modular expansion. 
Adsorption 
Adsorption is the concentration of a solute which maybe molecules dissolved or 
suspended in the liquid phase on the surface of a solid. During adsorption molecules 
bind onto the solid surface or are held of the solid surface by the weak 
intermolecular forces of attraction. 
Types of adsorbents used 
Biochar, activated carbon, clay minerals, zeolites and these have proved to be 
efficient in waste water treatment. Modified quartz sand has also shown better 
results in treating grey water at institutional level. 
Requirements of treated grey water for irrigation 
Grey water when treated should be able to meet standards for reuse according to 
different reuse options which include irrigation, toilet flushing and cleaning floors 
among others. It should be free from pathogens since human beings come in contact 
with it during the operations of these activities. 
 Guidelines for Wastewater Reuse in Irrigation (WHO, 2006) 
 Guidelines for wastewater reuse in irrigation (2006), provides the worldwide 
accepted framework for the safe application of wastewater and greywater in 
agriculture. The main aim is to protect the public health through the establishment 
of both the microbiological and physicochemical standards for the effluents that are 
to be used for irrigation. 

23 
 
The guidelines distinguish between three types of irrigation practices: unrestricted 
(for edible crops consumed raw), restricted (for crops not consumed raw), and non-
food crop irrigation. The required treatment level for the water depends on the 
exposure risk for humans based on the crop type and irrigation method chosen. 
Despite the emphasis on microbial risks, the WHO guidelines also suggest values for 
chemical parameters such as BOD, COD, TSS, turbidity, and nutrients with 
phosphorus among them. Monitoring such parameters is an indicator that wastewater 
is safe for irrigation and does not cause soil structure deterioration, emitter clogging, 
or environmental degradation.  
Table 2: Key effluent parameters for safe of treated wastewater in irrigation. 
Parameter 
Effluent standard (WHO, 2006) 
BOD 
≤ 30 mg/L 
COD 
≤ 50–100 mg/L 
Total Suspended Solids (TSS) 
≤ 30 mg/L 
Turbidity 
≤ 5 NTU 
Total Phosphorus (TP) 
≤ 2 mg/L 
 
Application of the guidelines in Irrigation  
In case the wastewater is treated to the level of WHO (2006) standards, it can be 
directly applied for agricultural irrigation but only if proper irrigation methods like 
drip irrigation are used. Such methods ensure that there is little human exposure 

24 
 
and that the likelihood of non-edible crops being contaminated is lessened. Varying 
the effluent parameters along with the irrigation system is a must for monitoring the 
process. 
2.7 SOAKPITS  
A soak pit also known as a soak away refers to a covered porous walled chamber 
usually around 1.5 to 4 m deep, into which effluent is discharged after being settled 
for the pre-specified time, so that the effluent is slowly infiltrated into the 
surrounding soil. It is used in most cases for disposing pre treated waste water from 
septic tanks, grease traps, and grey water treatment installations.  
In Uganda and several other countries that can be categorized as low or middle-
income, gravel-packing soak pits are a common practice for the disposal of small 
flows of waste water effluent or greywater. The sanitation guidelines refer to soak 
pits as inexpensive alternatives that do not require much area of land to be set aside 
and can only accommodate the influence volumes that are relatively small and may 
be a higher risk of groundwater pollution if they are poorly sited or designed (Ministry 
of Water and Environment, 2018).  
Through hydraulic infiltration, physical filtration, and biological processes, the 
effluent is infiltrated through the porous pit wall and the surrounding soil at a rate 
which is mainly controlled by the soil infiltration rate. The soil infiltration rate is 
obtained through percolation tests and the wetted wall area of the soak pit. Sandy 
or granular soils with high permeability are suitable while clayey or black-cotton 
soils have very low infiltration rates thus leading to quick ponding, back-up of 
wastewater, and surface overflow.  

25 
 
As the gray water comes in contact with gravel and soil, it gets rid of suspended 
solids, soap scum, and very fine particles that are all held within the voids of the 
soil. Such solids together with microbial biofilm undergo the process of forming a 
clogging layer(biomat) at the interface between the soil and water. This layer 
gradually decreases the effective infiltration capacity of the soak pit (UNHCR & 
Eawag, 2024).

CHAPTER3: METHODOLOGY  
3.1 ASSESSING THE PHYSICO-CHEMICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF GREY WATER. 
Grey water samples were collected from St. Francis Borgia, at key discharge points 
preserved below 4 degrees Celsius in a cooler box and transported to the laboratory. 
Samples were collected on different days in morning afternoon and evening to 
determine how they vary in different times due to different activities  
For the physical properties, these tests were carried out: turbidity and total 
suspended solids (TSS).  
For the chemical properties, these tests were carried out: pH, BOD, COD, phosphates 
and electrical conductivity. 
Procedure for determining BOD (APHA 5210B) 
Measure the initial dissolved oxygen level in the waste water sample. Pour a portion 
of the sample into a sealed BOD bottle and a separate bottle for dilution if needed. 
Incubate the sealed sample in the dark at 20oc for 5days. Measure the final Do level 
after this incubation period. Calculate the BOD by taking the difference of final DO 
initial DO 
Procedure for determining COD (APHA 520D) 
Pick a waste water sample and add a known amount of a strong oxidizing agent such 
as potassium dichromate in a digestion flask. Heat the flask at a high temperature 
for a set period to allow chemical reactions to happen. The remaining oxidizing 
agent is then measured through titration to determine the amount of oxygen 
required for chemical oxidation 

27 
 
3.2 DETERMINING THE PERCENTAGE REDUCTION OF CONTAMINANTS BY 
UNTREATED AND TREATED QUARTZ SAND 
Sourcing of graded quartz sand from Jomai quary. Sieve quartz sand of particle 
size(2mm) through a 2mm sieve. Wash, thoroughly the quartz silica sand with 
distilled water and ensure it gets rid of any dirt. Quartz silica sand is then mixed 
with a ferric chloride (FeCl3) solution to introduce iron oxides in a volume ratio of 
1:4 where one unit of silica sand will be added in 4 units of ferric chloride solution. 
Slowly by slowly, add the NaOH in the mixture until optimum pH 6-8 and soak for 1-
2 hours. pH is the most critical to determine the final structure, surface area and 
the stability of iron oxide coated sand. The FeOH precipitate forms directly on the 
sand surface and sand is separated from the mixture, washed with clean water and 
oven dried at 105 degrees Celsius.  Wash again to remove free ions that may leach 
with treated water. Make experimental setups that involve batch and column 
experiments with different bed heights and determine percentage removal of 
contaminants using the concentrations before and after treatment. Batch 
experiments are to determine optimal conditions (pH, contact time, adsorption 
capacity) and column experiments simulate real-time filtration performance under 
continuous flow. Measuring of key parameters again to check the percentage 
removal of contaminants from the samples.

3.3 DESIGNING GREY WATER TREATMENT UNIT WITH IRON COATED QUARTZ 
SAND 
By analyzing the quality and quantity of grey water, a suitable treatment unit is 
chosen using standard procedure. Determining the amount of grey water produced 
at St. Francis Borgia currently and future population projections, flow rates, 
velocities, contact time, filter depth and using AutoCAD for the drawings. It was 
found out that St. Francis Borgia generates 21 cubic metres of grey water per day 
with a population of 1115 students as of 2025. Pretreatment process was considered 
to remove large particles or debris from grey water. Filtration methods were 
incorporated to distribute water evenly over sand bed. Disinfection was to remove 
any pathogens that could have remained in the filtered water.

CHAPTER 4: RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
4.1 Introduction 
Grey water samples from key discharge points were analyzed at the National Water 
and Sewerage Corporation (NWSC) Bugolobi Laboratory to determine the physico 
chemical characteristics. The results obtained were compared to the National 
Environment Management Authority (NEMA) and NWSC effluent discharge guidelines, 
which set standards to protect human health, soil quality, and the environment. The 
parameters analyzed include Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Biological Oxygen 
Demand (BOD), Total Phosphates, Turbidity, Total Suspended Solids (TSS), pH, and 
Electrical Conductivity (EC).  
Results from grey water tested showed mean values of COD 128.8 mg/L, BOD 62 
mg/L, TSS 117.1 mg/L and TP 4.0 mg/L which confirmed that the greywater is high-
strength and does not comply with NEMA (2020) discharge limits. The morning and 
evening peaks correlate with various activities that take place at the school like 
bathing/laundry activity which accumulate high volumes of grey water and more 
concentrations (Kulabako, 2009). The neutral pH (7.3) and low EC (248.6 µS/cm) are 
favorable, indicating no acute salinity or acidity issues for treatment or reuse (WHO, 
2006).

The COD value in the evening was 146.3 mg/L, which was above the NEMA and NWSC 
discharge limit of 70 mg/L. This trend aligns with greywater patterns in East African 
institutions, where evening bathing and laundry activities produce concentrated 
organic-rich greywater (Mbae et al., 2024). COD indicates the amount of oxygen 
required to oxidize totally both biodegradable and non-biodegradable organic 
matter in water. Evening high COD levels could be the result of a large amount of 
grey water that has high concentrations pointing to the presence of organic 
pollutants such as soap residues, oils, and detergents which are typical in grey water 
from showers.  
These pollutants interact with water and thus they require more oxygen for chemical 
oxidation since the inorganics cannot be decomposed naturally as shown in fig 5 
According to the adsorption theory, the presence of large amounts of biodegradable 
and non-biodegradable organics increases the oxygen demand and determines how 
much can be removed by adsorption onto modified media. Treated quartz sand with 
iron oxides offers ligand exchange sites and electrostatic attraction that enhance 
binding of organic anions, partially explaining the improved removal in Table 4. 

33 
 
4.3 Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) 
 
            Figure 6: Variation of BOD with time 
The BOD value was measured as 74.7 mg/L in the evening, which was above the 
NEMA recommended limit of 50 mg/L for treated effluent discharge. BOD signifies 
the quantity of oxygen that living organisms would consume while eating away at 
organic matter, or rather in an aerobic situation. A high BOD indicates that the 
gray-water hides a lot of biodegradable organic materials like body fat, soap and 
skin coming from the shower water. If such water is disposed of or reused without 
proper treatment, the oxygen that is needed for microbial breakdown will out-
compete the one used by aquatic organisms, which will eventually result in oxygen 
depletion. 
4.3.1 VARIATION OF BOD AND COD IN GREY WATER THROUGHOUT THE DAY  
Grey water has been mainly produced in schools from kitchen, bathroom, and 
laundry uses. With the passage of time, the quality of this grey water varies, thus 
affecting its parameters like Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) and Chemical 

34 
 
Oxygen Demand (COD). These fluctuations are mainly caused by humans' different 
activities and the differing amounts of water being produced at different times. 
Morning 
The generation of grey water in the morning is at its highest point when most of the 
students and staff take their baths, brush their teeth, and do laundry. Soaps, 
detergents, body oils, and a little bit of organic matter make up the grey water at 
this time. Consequently, BOD and COD levels range moderately high because of both 
fresh organic input and higher concentrations.  
On the other hand, the highwater volume leads to slight dilution thus lowering the 
concentration of the pollutants a bit. (fig6) 
Afternoon 
In the afternoon, the production of grey water is less because most daily activities 
have already taken place. The water might become a bit stagnant, which would 
allow some microbial degradation to happen. The BOD and COD values are moderate 
or slightly lower than in the morning due to the less addition of fresh organic matter 
to the system. 
Evening 
Grey water production in the evening goes up again because of increased bathing 
and cooking activities. This water usually contains food particles, grease, soaps, and 
other organic pollutants in higher proportions. Hence the BOD and COD levels are 
highest at night due to a higher concentration of pollutants and less dilution 
compared to the morning period. 
 

35 
 
Influence of grey water volume on BOD 
The volume of water generated has an impact on the Biochemical Oxygen Demand 
(BOD) of grey water. From fig6, when the volume is high, such as during the 
morning, pollutants are more diluted thereby leading to a lower BOD concentration 
(dilution effect). In the case of the evening when the water volumes are low, there 
is less dilution of pollutants which results in the high BOD values. Hence, the 
concentration of BOD is inversely related to the volume of grey water produced. 
table 
4.4 Total Phosphates 
 
 
             Figure 7:  Variation of TP with time 
The total phosphate concentration was found to be 5.1 mg/L, in the evening time 
which is slightly above the NEMA standards for effluent discharge of 5 mg/L.  These 
results reflect detergent-based phosphate inputs a problem widely documented in 
African and Asian greywater streams (Eriksson et al., 2002). These values are nearly 

36 
 
same as those found in Ethiopian and Kenyan institutional greywater (4–8 mg/L) 
where detergent regulations are weak similar to Uganda 
 Excessive phosphate levels can lead to eutrophication of surface water if runoff 
occurs. However, the moderate concentration observed in this study is not harmful. 
For irrigation purposes, such phosphate levels are beneficial, as phosphorus is a key 
nutrient that supports plant growth and root development.  
But also applying phosphates grey water for irrigation might result in the soil's high 
phosphorus content which could change the chemical composition of the soil causing 
nutrient imbalance. 
4.5 Total Suspended Solids (TSS)
 
                Figure 8: Variation of TSS with time 
The evening value of Total suspended solids concentration was 152 mg/L which is 
more than the NEMA discharge limit of 50 mg/L. These values are the main factor in 
the rapid clogging of soak pits. In Uganda, it has been reported that soak pits with 
TSS >100 mg/L will lose their infiltration capacity within 6–12 months due to the 

37 
 
formation of a bio mat (Semiyaga et al., 2015). The TSS levels are over this limit in 
fig 8 thus demonstrating that the failure of the system was anticipated. 
TSS is made up of very tiny particles like silt, hair, soap residues, and other organic 
waste usually found in grey water. The presence of high TSS can slow down the water 
movement in soil and that can eventually lead to sealing up the surface and clogging 
the soak pits. The high TSS value implies that effective sedimentation or filtration 
is required before the grey water is approved for watering plants.  
4.6 Ph 
 
 
         Figure 9: Variation of pH with time 
The pH of the grey water was 7.3 in the evening and morning time which falls within 
the NEMA and WHO acceptable range of 5.0 to 8.5 for effluent discharge reuse. This 
means that the grey water is not acidic or strongly alkaline hence it is safe for all 
types of soils and plants. A pH of 7 neutral helps nutrients and microorganisms in 
the soil. 

38 
 
4.7 Electrical Conductivity (EC) 
The Electrical Conductivity (EC) was found to be 265 µS/cm, which is significantly 
lower than the NEMA recommended maximum limit of 1000 µS/cm. The 
measurement of EC indicates the amount of dissolved ions including sodium, 
chloride, and sulfate that are present in the water. Low EC values indicate low 
salinity, which is ideal for irrigation because it minimizes the risk of salt 
accumulation in soil and prevents osmotic stress in plants. 
 High EC values, by contrast, suggest high salt levels that can damage soil structure 
and inhibit plant water uptake. Therefore, the recorded EC value (tab shows that 
the grey water poses minimal risk of soil salinization and is appropriate for reuse 
after basic treatment. 
 4.8 PERCENTAGE REDUCTION OF CONTAMINANTS WITH PLAIN AND TREATED 
QUATRZ SAND 
4.8.1 COLUMN EXPERIMENTS 
Column experiments were carried out for adsorption and filtration with different 
bed heights, surface areas and with plain quartz sand and treated quartz sand at 
different contact times. 
Results showed that there is a higher percentage removal of contaminants by 
increase in contact time from 30minutes to 60minutes and bed height of treated 
quartz sand from 20cm was 40cm because adsorption is time dependent. The plain 
quartz sand showed a smaller percentage of contaminant reduction indicating that 
treatment(modifying) was necessary. This was indicated by different percentages by 
the parameters measured before and after treatment of grey water. The treated 

39 
 
quartz sand showed better results possibly because higher adsorption capacity of 
iron oxides for contaminants. These findings are similar to studies in Kenya and South 
Africa where ICQS increased phosphate removal by 40–80% and enhanced organic 
matter capture (Oteng-Peprah et al., 2018)
