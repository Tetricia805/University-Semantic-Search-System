In this text, Jesus addresses the Pharisees'\ninquiry regarding the legitimacy of divorce by stressing the divine intention for marriage to be a\nlifelong and indissoluble union. Drawing from the Genesis creation narrative, Jesus asserts that\nmarriage, as ordained by God, should not be dissolved by human actions. Citing France, R. T.\nHowever, “He acknowledges an exception in cases of \"sexual immorality,\" a term that has been\nthe subject of extensive theological debate which the study1” undertaken France.\nAccording to Carson, D. A. Matthew 19:3-9 has deeply influenced Christian doctrines on\nmarriage, divorce, and remarriage, highlighting the pressure between the ideal of lifelong\nmarriage and the complications essential in human relationships. This research examines the\nBiblical views on divorce as presented in this passage, taking into account its historical and\ncultural context, theological significance, and its ongoing impact on Christian teachings.\nThrough this exploration, the study aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how this\nscripture has informed Christian perspectives on divorce and how it continues to shape\ncontemporary discussions on the subject2. 1.1 Background to the study\n1.1 Background to the study\nChristian teachings on marriage affirm that marriage is God’s idea not human being. This further\nargues that, According to John Stott “The Biblical revelation identifies that God purposefully\ninstituted marriage for the mutual society, help and comfort that one ought to have, of the other\nboth in prosperity and adversity, the procreation of children and their upbringing in an\n\n1 France, R.

God designed marriage and the family to\nensure that the world He created becomes a place of hope, happiness, love, friendship and peace.\nThis makes marriage a vital establishment for a person’s happiness and contentment in life. The\nChristian view of marriage is a lifelong commitment.\nThe beauty of marriage begins when a man and a woman fall in love and make preparation to\nlive together as a husband and a wife. At this point in their lives, both put in much effort to make\ntheir purposes fulfilled. Unfortunately, the case now a marriage which began with tender love\nand rich expectations now lies in skeletons. The experience of divorce is very devastating with\nits challenges. John Stott citied “It violates God’s will, frustrates His purposes, and brings to a\nhusband and(2)wife the pains of rejection, disappoint, guilt and the children of the marriage if\nthere are any become vulnerable after divorce”. Divorce is a means whereby a legal marriage is\ndissolved publicly and the participants are free from further obligations of the matrimonial\nrelationship. (3) Divorce has become an issue in our society as a result of the many consequences\nit brings on the parties involved, the children and the society at large. More than just affecting\nthe immediate family, divorce can have a profoundly negative effect on society as a whole.\nDespite the sufferings accompanying divorce, the rate of divorce continues to be high. The\nnegative effects is a drain on our churches and societies as a whole and the costs attached to them\ngo far beyond just financial expenditure.(4) Cases of divorce have become so rampant and\nwidespread, even in Christian marriages, some Men and Women of God are not spared. Despite\nthe series of counseling sessions that are held for couples by their churches, divorce is still on the\nincrease.

However, contemporary society witnesses a significant rise in\ndivorce rates, which poses a fundamental challenge to the biblical understanding of marriage\nwithin Christian communities. This research project aims to explore the underlying factors\ncontributing to the conflict between the biblical teaching on marriage's permanence and the\nreality of marital breakdowns. By researching into the complexities surrounding marital stability,\nincluding societal influences, individual motivations, and spiritual perspectives, this study seeks\nto provide insights that align with Matthew 19:3-9 and offer potential interventions to strengthen\nmarriages within Christian faith communities which seems not to be in the contemporary church.\n1.3 Research objectives\nTo exegete the meaning of marriage in Matthew 19: 3-9\nTo critically examine the social, cultural, and legal perspectives on marriage and divorce.\nTo investigate ways through which the church can respond to issues of divorce that arise in\nfamilies and churches.\n1.4 Research questions.\nWhat does the Bible teach on marriage and divorce according to Matthew 19:3-9 and Genesis 2?\nHow do contemporary criticisms of marriage and divorce reflect the changing attitudes towards\nthese institution?\nIn what ways can the church respond to issues of divorce in family affecting the church?\n1.5 The significance of the study.\nThe importance of this study is emphasized by the ever-increasing occurrence of divorce,\nparticularly within the Christian community.

B. Powers\nexplains that marriage serves a single purpose with three dimensions: companionship, mutual\nassistance, and the fulfillment of the sexual aspects of both man and woman. This union is built\non mutual commitment and relies on the ongoing consent of both partners. Additionally,\nmarriage is emphasized as a creation ordinance and a gift from God to humanity, designed for\nmen and women5.\n1.1.2 Other Scholars' Views from Biblical Points\nBible scholars see Genesis 2:24 as the basis for the meaning of marriage. The text states,\n“Therefore a man leaves his father and his mother and cleaves to his wife, and they become one\nflesh.” Jesus later quoted this when asked about permissible grounds for divorce (Matthew 19:4-\n5). This verse was spoken by God right after Eve was brought to Adam, who recognized her as\nhis God-given spouse6.\nIn the Bible, marriage exists when a man leaves his parents to cleave to his wife and become one\nflesh with her. This reveals the Biblical understanding of marriage as a covenant relationship.\n\n5 Powers, B. (2003). Marriage: Its foundation, purpose, and covenant nature.

(n.d.).G\n\nenesis 2:24.\n\nMalachi 2:14 explicitly expresses this meaning, stating, “...It is because the Lord is acting as the\nwitness between you and the wife of your youth, because you have broken faith with her, though\nshe is your partner, the wife of your marriage covenant.7”\nMarriage is a lifelong commitment between a man and a woman involving mutual sexual rights.\nCharacteristics of the biblical concept of marriage are found in Genesis 2:24, indicating that\nmarriage is an exclusive man-woman relationship, publicly acknowledged and consummated by\nsexual intercourse.\n1.1.3 ‘Leaving’ – The First Component of the Marriage Covenant\nThe first step in establishing a marriage covenant is leaving all other relationships, including the\nclosest ones of father and mother: “Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother” (Gen\n2:24). The key word “leave,” expressed in Hebrew as aw-zah, means to release, forsake, leave\ndestitute, or refuse. The idea here is that the man forsakes his parents, cuts himself off from\nthem, and breaks the union with them almost in the sense of divorcing himself and becoming\nlater single. It is as if he has been bound to them in a marriage state but, in an act of the will,\ndeparts from them regarding responsibility and dependence (if such exists) and becomes alone to\nunite with the chosen woman. The bridegroom cannot be both a dependent child and an\nindependent husband in the same home. Even in a world infused with the concept of extended\nfamilies, priorities must be kept straight.\nThe text speaks specifically of the man in this matter. He must be his own head of the household.\nIf in family relations he is dependent upon his father, then to whom do his dependents look for\nauthority? It would create for his wife an unworkable ordered arrangement: she would have two\nheads (i.e., her husband and his father), which, according to Jesus (Matthew 6:24), is not right. In\nsuch an arrangement, the father’s authority would possibly overtake her husband’s, yet,\naccording to the Scripture, it is the latter who is to be her final authority in family matters\n(Ephesians 5:22-34).\nLeaving does not mean the abandonment of one’s parents. The responsibility to “Honor your\nfather and mother” (Ex 20:12) is applied by Jesus to adults (Mark 7:6-13). This is not evading\nour responsibility toward our parents as they grow old. Jesus despised the pretense of those who\ngave to the Temple the money they had set aside for their parents (Mark 7:9-13). As adults,", "word_count": 471, "start_char": 23242, "end_char": 26091}

The Bible never suggests\nthat married couples should sever their ties with their parents, but that they must “let go” of their\nformer lives as sons and daughters to cement their relationships as husbands and wives. What\n“leaving” means is that all lesser relationships must give way to the newly formed marital\nrelationship8.\nA leaving must occur to cement a covenant relationship of husband and wife. This principle of\nleaving applies likewise to our covenant relationship with God. It is said of the disciples that\n“they left everything and followed Him” (Luke 5:11). Leaving is not always easy. It is often hard\nfor a baby to leave his mother’s womb. It may look cruel to see a doctor cut the umbilical cord\nwhich binds the baby to the mother. Yet, it is necessary for the growth and development of the\nbaby. It is also hard for children to leave their parents and for parents to let their children go.\nSimilarly, a marriage cannot mature unless both partners are willing to leave their parents to\ncement a new marital relationship and establish a new family.\nLeaving involves ending financial dependence upon parents to stand financially on your own feet\nto develop your future plans independently. It again involves leaving behind parental authority\nsince possessive, interfering parents can threaten the best marriages. This does not imply that\nparental authority ends with marriage or that one ignores, abandons, or forsakes his or her\nparents. In Ephesians 6:1, it is made clear that “Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this\nis right.” Also, in Exodus 20:12, “Honor your father and your mother and you may live long in\nthe land the LORD your God is giving you.” Leaving means the husband-wife relationship is\nnow the priority relationship.\nAnother aspect of leaving is learning to abandon some of our parents’ attitudes and influences. In\neffect, the first principle derived from the divine institution of marriage recorded in Genesis 2:24\nis, ‘To establish an exciting “one flesh” marriage covenant, we must be willing to leave all lesser\nrelationships.’\n1.1.4 ‘Cleaving’ – The Second Component of the Marriage Covenant\nThe second essential component of a marriage covenant is cleaving: “Therefore a man leaves his\nfather and mother and cleaves to his wife” (Gen 2:24). A leaving must occur before a cleaving\ntake place. This process reveals divine wisdom. A man and a woman must leave all relationships", "word_count": 473, "start_char": 25772, "end_char": 28624}

The Hebrew word for “cleave”\ndabaq suggests the idea of being permanently glued or joined together. It is one of the words\nfrequently used to express the covenant commitment of the people to God: “You shall fear the\nLord your God; you shall serve him and cleave to Him” (Deuteronomy 10:20; cf. 11:22; 13:4;\n30:20). The word is used to describe Ruth’s refusal to leave her mother-in-law Naomi: “Ruth\nclave unto her” (Ruth 1:14). In the sight of God, cleaving means wholehearted commitment\nwhich falls over to every area of our being. Cleaving involves endless loyalty to one’s marital\npartner. Note that man is to cleave to “his wife.” This excludes marital unfaithfulness. A man\ncannot be glued to his wife and play or engage in sexual intercourse with another woman. The\ntwo are mutually limited.\nIn a marriage covenant, cleaving does not allow the “freedom to leave” when the relationship is\nno longer satisfying. If the “freedom to leave” is retained as a real option, it will hinder the total\neffort to develop a marital relationship characterized by covenant faithfulness. As in marriage,\n“Keeping divorce as an escape clause indicates a flaw in your commitment to each other, even as\na tiny crack can be fatally widened by the many forces working to destroy homes and families.”\nIt could be summarized that the second principle derived from the divine institution of marriage\nrecorded in Genesis 2:24 is: To maintain a exciting “one flesh” marriage covenant we must be\nwilling to cleave to our marital partners, avoiding any thought, word, or action that could weaken\nloyalty and commitment to them.\n1.1.5‘Becoming One Flesh’ – The Third Component of the Marriage Covenant\nThe third essential ingredient of a marriage covenant is that “they become one flesh” (Gen 2:24).\nNote the progression: leaving, cleaving, and becoming one flesh. As husband and wife leave\nlesser relationships and learn to cleave to one another, they become a new entity, “one flesh.”\nThe phrase “one flesh” needs some explanation because it is frequently misunderstood to refer\nprimarily to the sexual union. To become “one flesh” (Gen 2:24) means to become one\nfunctioning unit. Samuele Bacchiocchi quotes10, becoming one flesh “involves the complete\nidentification of one personality with the other in a community of interests and pursuits, a union", "word_count": 433, "start_char": 28492, "end_char": 31157}

Paul explicitly uses the phrase in this way\nwhen speaking of sexual intercourse between a man and a harlot (1 Cor. 6:16). Sexual\nintercourse, however, does not automatically assure that a man and a woman become one in a\nmystical, emotional, and spiritual unity.\n1.1.6 Conclusion;\nThis chapter examined the Biblical foundations of marriage and divorce. The teachings of\nGenesis, the prophets, Jesus, and Paul regarding marriage consistently highlight how Scripture\nviews marriage as a sacred and permanent covenant, overseen and safeguarded by God. Marriage\nas a sacred covenant is used in the Old Testament to depict God's relationship with Israel and in\nthe New Testament to illustrate Christ's relationship with His church. If God used marriage to\nsymbolize His commitment to His people, it must be seen as a sacred, enduring covenant.\nReaffirming the Biblical perspective of marriage as a sacred and permanent covenant, guaranteed\nby God, is crucial to counteracting the secularization of marriage. This secularization has led\nmany Christians to see marriage as a temporary social contract governed by civil laws, rather\nthan a lasting covenant witnessed and guaranteed by God. To address this, Christians must\nrediscover and embrace the Biblical view of marriage as a sacred covenant.\n1.2.0 Research design/ plan\nIn the broad sense of the word, research design means all the issues involved in the planning,\nexecution of the research project from identifying the problem through to the report and\nsubmission of the results.

This process includes\nunderstanding the Pharisaic views on divorce, exploring the legal and religious framework of\nmarriage in Jewish law, considering Jesus' broader teachings on ethics and the Kingdom of God,\nand conducting a comparative analysis with parallel passages in Mark 10:2-12 and Luke 16:18.\nBy researching these aspects, historical criticism seeks to uncover the original meaning and\nsignificance of Jesus' teachings on divorce and remarriage for his contemporary audience12.\n1.2.2 Literal analysis of Matthew 19:3-9\nInterpreting Biblical Texts through Various Critical Approaches\nUnderstanding biblical texts requires a comprehensive approach encompassing different methods\nof criticism and analysis. This ensures a well-rounded interpretation of the scriptures, particularly\nin understanding theological concepts such as marriage and divorce. This section explores how\ndifferent critical methods can be applied to the study of biblical texts, using Genesis 2:18-25 and\nMatthew 19:3-9 as focal points. Textual criticism involves examining manuscript evidence to\nreconstruct the original text. For studying God's mandate for marriage in Genesis, this entails\nweighing variant readings to recreate its initial meaning. This method focuses on the text as it\nwas likely written, free from later alterations and interpolations. By comparing different\nmanuscripts and versions, the researcher identifies the most authentic wording, ensuring an\naccurate interpretation of the biblical mandate for marriage.\n1.2.2.1 Historical Criticism\nHistorical criticism seeks to reconstruct the history behind the text. For Genesis, this means\nunderstanding the cultural, religious, and historical context in which the text was written. This\napproach uncovers the background and circumstances that influenced the writing of Genesis,\nproviding insights into the societal norms and theological concepts prevalent at the time.

For\nGenesis 2:18-25, this means examining the meanings of words such as \"helper,\" \"suitable,\" and\n\"one flesh\" to understand their implications within the context of marriage. Lexical analysis\nclarifies the nuances of these terms, contributing to a more precise interpretation of the text. This\nmethod focuses on the individual words and their meanings, essential for understanding how\nthey contribute to the overall message of the passage. Discourse analysis focuses on the flow and\nunity of the text, examining how ideas are developed and connected throughout the passage. For\nMatthew 19:3-9, discourse analysis involves analyzing the features that show the coherence and\nprogression of the argument about divorce. This method identifies the rhetorical strategies and\ndiscourse markers used by the author to emphasize key points and maintain the logical flow of\nthe discussion.

It begins with the Pharisees questioning Jesus about the acceptability of divorce for\nany reason. In His response, Jesus refers to the Genesis account to emphasize that marriage was\nintended by God to be a lifelong, indivisible union. While Jesus acknowledges the Mosaic\nconcern permitting divorce due to \"hardness of heart\" (σκληροκαρδία), He emphasizes that this\nconcession was a temporary allowance due to human failure and not part of the original divine\nplan for marriage. To fully understand this passage, it is essential to consider the common\nhistorical context of beginning Jewish marriage practices. During this age, men could initiate\ndivorce for various reasons, reflecting the broader discussion among Jewish scholars, such as\nHillel and Shammai, about the grounds for divorce. The Pharisees' question highlights the\ncomplication and disagreement of these practices.\nThe passage features significant terms like \"hardness of heart\" (σκληροκαρδία) and \"one flesh\"\n(σὰρξ μία), which explain the moral failings and ideal unity of marriage, respectively. The\nanalysis of Jesus' response reveals His confident in interpretation of Scripture, reinforcing the\nsacredness of marriage. The interaction between Jesus and the Pharisees shifts from a legal\ndiscussion to a profound theological statement, reflecting a dynamic conflict. This tension\nillustrates a disagreement story, revealing of broader dissatisfaction with existing divorce norms.\nSource criticism suggests that Matthew's account may have been influenced by earlier traditions,\nincluding those from the Gospel of Mark, to address issues related to his community. Matthew\nfocus was on highlighting theological themes, aligning Jesus' teachings with Old Testament\nscriptures (see France. Additionally, rhetorical criticism examines how Jesus uses scriptural\nauthority to challenge contemporary divorce practices and reaffirm the purity of marriage13.\n\n13 France, R. T. (2007).

The author exhibits a profound understanding of Jewish customs, scriptures, and\nprophetic fulfillment, indicating a background closely aligned with Jewish traditions.\nThe primary audience of Matthew's Gospel is Jewish Christians. The text emphasizes Jesus as\nthe fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies and presents Him as the long-awaited Messianic\nKing14.\nThe purpose of the Gospel is to present Jesus as the Messianic King and authoritative teacher\nwho fulfills the Law and the Prophets. It aims to establish the legitimacy of Jesus' teachings and\nhis role in God's redemptive plan15.\nAccording to R. T. France, the late first-century context of Matthew's Gospel highlights the\ncommunity's efforts to navigate their faith among Jewish traditions. The Gospel of Matthew was\ncomposed during this period, marked by the promising Christian community's efforts to define\nits identity distinct from Judaism. This era saw significant theological and social challenges as\nChristians navigated their faith in a predominantly Jewish context.

T. France in \"The Gospel of Matthew\" from the New International Commentary\non the New Testament, \"The question posed by the Pharisees aims to draw Jesus into the\nongoing debate between the Hillel and Shammai schools\" (p. 280). The Pharisees, known for\ntheir strict adherence to the Mosaic Law, approached Jesus with the intent of trapping him in a\ntheological debate. Their inquiry, \"Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any and every\nreason?\" was designed to involve Jesus in the argumentative dialogue regarding the grounds for\ndivorce. This question stresses the differing interpretations among Jewish scholars, particularly\nthe contrasting views of the Hillelite and Shammaite schools. The Hillelites advocated for a more\nlenient stance, allowing divorce for minor causes, while the Shammaites maintained a stricter\nposition, restricting divorce to serious wrongdoings such as adultery.\nAccording to U. Luz in \"Matthew 8-20: A Commentary\" from the Hermeneia Series, \"The\nPharisees' query is rooted in the complex and often contentious interpretations of Deuteronomy\n24:1-4\" The Pharisees' question reflects a legalistic approach, examining Jesus' conformity to the\nMosaic Law. Jewish law, as outlined in Deuteronomy 24:1-4, permitted divorce, although the\nconditions and justifications for such an act were subjects of significant debate. This encounter\nhighlights the dominant cultural and religious context: while divorce was permissible, the\ngrounds for it remained a sensitive issue.\n2.3.2 Verse 4: Beginning (ἀρχή, archē) Creator (κτίζω, ktizō)\nJesus redirects the discussion to the foundational creation narrative, invoking Genesis 1:27. His\nrhetorical question, \"Haven't you read,\" appeals to the authority of Scripture, which the Pharisees\nrevered. By highlighting that the Creator \"made them male and female,\" Jesus underscores the\noriginal divine intent for human beings and their relational dynamics. Bauckham16. Notes, \"Jesus'\ncitation of Genesis establishes a foundational basis for understanding the divine intent of\nmarriage\" This assertion serves to remind the Pharisees of the inherent purpose and sacredness\nrooted within the institution of marriage as imagined at the beginning of creation17.\n\n16 Bauckham, R.

The creation account establishes the binary nature of\nhumanity and the complementary design of male and female, intended for unity and mutual\nfulfillment. This invocation of Scripture situates Jesus' response within a broader theological\nframework, emphasizing divine intentionality over human legalism.\n2.3.3 Verse 5: Leave (καταλείπω, kataleipō), United (προσκολλάω, proskollaō) Flesh\n(σάρξ, sarx)\nBy quoting Genesis 2:24, Jesus elucidates the profound unity and permanence of the marital\nbond. The passage, \"For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his\nwife, and the two will become one flesh,\" signifies a transformative and covenantal union.\nWaltke and Fredrick state, \"The concept of 'one flesh' signifies an intimate and unbreakable\nunion within the marital relationship\" This union transcends previous familial allegiances,\nestablishing a new, primary relationship between husband and wife. The metaphor of \"one flesh\"\nconveys the depth of this connection, implying an indivisible and holistic partnership18.\nIn Jewish tradition, familial loyalty and the honor accorded to parents were paramount. Jesus'\nassertion that a man will leave his father and mother to be united with his wife introduces a\nradical reordering of relational priorities. The emphasis on the \"one flesh\" concept denotes an\nindissoluble unity, challenging contemporary norms and practices concerning marriage and\ndivorce.\n2.3.4 Verse 6: One (εἷς, heis) Joined (συνζεύγνυμι, synzeugnymi) Separate (χωρίζω,\nchōrizō)\nJesus culminates his argument with a definitive pronouncement on the divine sovereignty over\nmarriage. The statement, \"So they are no longer two, but one flesh,\" reiterates the indivisibility\nof the marital union. Jesus further asserts, \"Therefore what God has joined together, let no one\nseparate,\" raising divine authority and leaving out human interference in the dissolution of\nmarriage.

Jesus' declaration elevates the discussion\nto a theological plane, emphasizing covenant fidelity and divine right. The indissolubility of\nmarriage as articulated here challenges the permissive attitudes towards divorce and underscores\na higher ethical and theological standard.\n2.3.5 Verse 7: Certificate (βιβλίον, biblion) Divorce (ἀποστάσιον, apostasion).\nThe Pharisees counter Jesus' argument by invoking Deuteronomy 24:1-4, which stipulates the\nissuance of a certificate of divorce. Their question, \"Why then did Moses command that a man\ngive his wife a certificate of divorce and send her away?\" highlights a perceived discrepancy\nbetween Jesus' teachings and Mosaic Law. Instone-Brewer explains, \"Moses' regulation was a\nprotective measure designed to prevent arbitrary divorces and ensure legal recognition\" (p. 89).\nThe Pharisees interpret Moses' regulation as a prescriptive command, implying an endorsement\nof divorce under certain conditions.20\nMoses' regulation concerning divorce was instituted within a patriarchal society to provide a\nmeasure of protection for women. By mandating a formal certificate, the law aimed to prevent\narbitrary and capricious dismissals, thereby safeguarding women's rights and ensuring legal\nrecognition of the dissolution of marriage21.\nThe Pharisees' reference to this law reflects a legalistic interpretation, focusing on the procedural\naspects rather than the underlying ethical principles.

He contrasts this with the original divine intent, \"But it was not\nthis way from the beginning,\" underscoring the distinction between divine ideal and human\naccommodation23.\nMoses' allowance for divorce was a pragmatic response to the realities of human sinfulness and\nthe hardness of heart. It aimed to mitigate potential injustice and harm within the marital\nrelationship. However, Jesus reaffirms the original divine standard for marriage, rooted in\ncreation, which envisaged a permanent and sacred union. This higher ethical standard calls for\nadherence to the divine ideal rather than mere legal compliance. The phrase \"hardness of heart\"\nindicates a moral and spiritual deficiency necessitating regulatory measures24.\n2.3.7 Verse 9: Sexual immorality (πορνεία, porneia) Adultery (μοιχάω, moichaō)\nThe exception for sexual immorality (πορνεία, porneia) reflects the gravity of this breach of the\nmarital covenant (Wenham & Heth, Jesus’ teaching on divorce and remarriage sets a high ethical\nstandard, emphasizing the sanctity of marriage25. By introducing the exception clause, \"except\nfor sexual immorality,\" Jesus permits divorce in cases of marital infidelity. However, He also\nreinforces the principle of marital fidelity by stating that remarriage after an unjustifiable divorce\nconstitutes adultery26.\nThis teaching raises the sanctity of marriage and stresses the ethical demands of covenant\nloyalty. By permitting divorce only in cases of sexual immorality, Jesus challenges the merciful\ncontemporary practices that allowed for divorce on small grounds. This emphasis on marital\nfidelity and the significance of divorce and remarriage bring into line with broader theological\nthemes of holiness, covenant, and divine intention27.\n\n23 Nolland, J.

This portrays Jesus approving God's original plan for marriage as a\nlifetime union between a man and a woman, condemning divorce except in cases of sexual\nimmorality. This scripture stresses the importance of honoring marital commitments, the spiritual\nand moral aspects of relationships within the setting of God.\nMosaic Law vs. God's Ideal Jesus gaps the permissive nature of the Mosaic Law regarding\ndivorce (Deuteronomy 24:1-4) with God's ideal standard of marriage, highlighting the hardness\nof human hearts as the reason for the law's allowance.\nException Clause Jesus allows for divorce in cases of sexual immorality (Greek: πορνεία,\nporneia), indicating a break of the marital covenant that justifies separation.\nIn contrast to Genesis 1:27 states, \"So God created mankind in his own image, in the image of\nGod he created them; male and female he created them.\" This verse establishes the foundational\nprinciple of humanity being created in God's image and the dual nature of genders (male and\nfemale). Jesus' reference to this in Matthew 19 reaffirms the sanctity and permanence of the\nmarital union based on God's original design.\nThe passage in Matthew 19:3-9 addresses difficult issues surrounding divorce, marriage, and\nGod's design for human relationships. It underscores the importance of understanding Biblical\nprinciples in their original context while also dealing with contemporary ethical and societal\nchallenges.\nThe tension between Mosaic Law, cultural practices, and God's ideal standard raised questions\nabout the interpretation and application of Biblical teachings in different historical and cultural\nsettings.

Firstly, marriage is often seen as a legal domestic partnership, where\nending the relationship legally is not considered significant. Secondly, it is primarily viewed as a\nsexual arrangement between a man and a woman, with minimal societal impact when it ends.\nThirdly, marriage is sometimes reduced to a purely commercial arrangement, akin to ending a\nbusiness partnership.\nThese secular views contrast sharply with the biblical perspective of marriage as ordained by\nGod. McLuhan emphasizes that the sanctity and dignity of marriage, according to biblical\nteachings, are tied to the creation and procreation of complete human beings in body, soul, and\nspirit. Scriptural marriage involves a deep unity of spirit, soul, and body, along with shared God\nand physical familiarity. This chapter critically examine the social, cultural, and legal\nperspectives on marriage and divorce, discovering how these institutions have developed over\ntime and the impact of these changes on modern society.\n3.1 Scholars’ Views\nIn our contemporary secular world, the perception of the marriage relationship is progressively\ncharacterized by three essential concepts. Firstly, it is often seen as a legal domestic partnership,\nwhere the ending of the relationship legally is not considered a significant issue. Secondly, it is\nprimarily viewed as a sexual arrangement between a man and a woman, and their decision to end\nthe relationship is seen as a personal matter with minimal societal impact. Thirdly, marriage is\nsometimes reduced to a purely commercial arrangement, where its termination is like to ending\nany business partnership.\nMcLuhan emphasizes that these secular views contrast sharply with the biblical perspective of\nmarriage as ordained by God.

True scriptural marriage involves a deep unity of spirit, soul, and body, along with a\nshared God, and love-driven physical familiarity28.\nJohn Stott adds that while marriage is a recognized human institution across societies, it is\nfundamentally God's idea, not a human invention, according to Christian teachings29. Francis\nBenyah further expands on this by noting that marriage has endured as an institution with various\ncultural interpretations since biblical times. He points to Genesis 2:24 as a central biblical\nreference that encapsulates the essence of biblical marriage—a union where a man leaves his\nparents to be united with his wife, forming a profound oneness.30 It can be indirect that the initial\npicture of marriage in the Bible, involving leaving, cleaving, and becoming one flesh, signifies\nthe biblical concept of marriage as a covenantal relationship. Benyah also suggests that God's\nintention for marriage was for it to be a lifelong union. The man's departure from his parental\nhome to unite with his wife and become one flesh with her reflects this divine design. Both Jesus\n(Matthew 19:5) and Paul (Ephesians 5:31) referenced this Genesis passage as the foundational\nunderstanding of marriage31. Based on this passage, it is in directly that the initial representation\nof marriage in the Bible, involving leaving, cleaving, and becoming one flesh, signifies the\nbiblical concept of marriage as a covenant relationship. Additionally, Benyah suggests that God\nintended marriage to be a permanent union, where the man leaves his parental home to unite with\nhis wife and become one flesh with her. Both Jesus (Matthew 19:5) and Paul (Ephesians 5:31)\nreferenced this Genesis passage as the foundational evidence of marriage.\nMoving on to the African concept of marriage, Kwame Gyekye views marriage as a fundamental\ninstitution in African society, serving not only to establish and maintain families but also to\ncreate and uphold kinship ties. He notes that in many African societies, a young man with\nemployment and income is expected to marry, and delays may lead to parental or elder\nintervention to encourage marriage.

Failure to do so may be seen as a disruption to\nthe community and can carry negative social connotations32.\nNot marrying under normal circumstances implies that the individual has rejected societal\nnorms, leading society to reciprocate (respond) by rejecting them. G. K. Nunkunya shares a\nsimilar perspective, defining marriage as a union recognized legally, religiously, and culturally\nbetween a man and a woman who have followed societal procedures.33\nRebecca Ganusah emphasizes that marriage holds immense value in African societies, and\nremaining unmarried past a certain age draws attention and may be interpreted negatively. For\ninstance, an unmarried man might be seen as antisocial or irresponsible. Ganusah also notes that\nin Africa, marriage extends beyond the couple to include the families of both the man and\nwoman. The household network encompasses relatives by blood, creating a communal life where\nthe well-being of a couple affects the whole extended family34.\n3.2 Marriage as Portrayed in the Book of Genesis\nMany scholars of the Bible regard Genesis 2:24 as foundational for understanding the heart of\nmarriage. The verse summarizes the definition of marriage: \"Therefore a man leaves his father\nand his mother and cleaves to his wife, and they become one flesh35.\nJesus later referenced this verse when questioned about acceptable reasons for divorce (Matthew\n19:4-5). Notably, Genesis 2:24 was spoken by God immediately after Eve was presented to\nAdam, signifying Adam's recognition of her as his God-given partner\nResearch can conclude that according to the biblical perspective, a marriage is recognized by\nGod when a man not only physically separates from his parents but also committed to deep\npromise with his wife, represented by becoming one flesh with her.

This covenant of companionship is further explained in\nbiblical. Malachi 2:14, where God is depicted as the witness to the marriage covenant and\nreproves against breaking faith with one's spouse.\nUnderstanding the Christian perspective on the purpose and core of marriage is crucial. It is\nviewed as a lifelong commitment between a man and a woman, surrounding mutual sexual\nrights. Benyah Francis, “because your heart were hard: an examination of Jesus’ discourse on\ndivorce in Mark 10:2-12”36,\nThe biblical concept of marriage is reflected in the statement from Genesis 2:24 (KJV):\n\"Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they\nshall be one flesh.\" This verse emphasizes that marriage is an exclusive relationship between a\nman and a woman, publicly recognized and hardened through sexual intimacy. Samuele\nBacchiocchi refers to these aspects as the central components of the marriage covenant. Samuele\nBacchiocchi, the Marriage Covenant: a biblical study on marriage, divorce and remarriage37.\n3.3 Conclusion\nThe prevailing secular views of marriage—often seen as a legal, sexual, or commercial\narrangement—tend to reduce its perceived meaning and enable its dissolution. This modern\nperspective suddenly contrasts with the Biblical understanding, which presents marriage as a\ndivinely instituted covenant characterized by deep sacredness and permanence. McLuhan’s\nanalysis emphasizes the biblical portrayal of marriage as a complete union of body, soul, and\nspirit, which integrates both divine purpose and personal commitment.\nThis scriptural foundation supports the view of marriage as an enduring, sacred covenant,\nstanding in opposition to secular interpretations that often undermine its theological and moral\nimportance. The biblical model thus provides a timeless and divine framework that challenges\ncontemporary secular reductions, reaffirming the enduring significance of marriage as a sacred\ninstitution.\n\n36 Trinity journal of church and theology, Vol 18no 1 March2014.\n37 (Michigan biblical perspective, 2001), 16", "word_count": 400, "start_char": 68181, "end_char": 70943}

This chapter discovers the\nresponse of churches to divorce cases within the church and societies. Furthermore, it gives light\non the church's purpose and responsibility concerning the matter of divorce.\nThe term \"church\" in the English Bible is translated from the Greek word \"ekklesia.\" This word\ncombines \"kaleo\" (to call) with the prefix \"ek\" (out), thus meaning \"the called out ones.\" A more\nprecise translation would be \"assembly\" since \"ekklesia\" referred to a group of people\nsummoned for a meeting. It was also synonymous with \"synagogue,\" which signifies a gathering\nor \"Body of Christ.\" As believers are united with Christ through spiritual baptism, they are\ncollectively known as the body of Christ (Romans 12:4-5; 1 Corinthians 12:11, 13, 18, 27;\nColossians 1:18; Ephesians 5:30). This metaphor highlights both the interdependence and\ndiversity among members (Romans 12:4; 1 Corinthians 12:14-17)38.\nThe purpose of the church According to David Kpobi, the purpose of the church is to\ncommunicate God’s purpose for the world and for individual lives and to present Jesus as the one\nwho can provide genuine meaning to life. Additionally, Christian mission aims to integrate the\npractice of faith with all aspects of life, encouraging Christians to make a positive impact\nwherever they are.\nM. G. McLuhan emphasizes that the increasing disregard for the sanctity of marriage in secular\nsociety is leading many believers, who were previously married to unbelievers, to return to the\nchurch after experiencing unwanted divorces. The rise of self-centeredness and narcissistic\nbehavior is infiltrating the church, contributing to a higher divorce rate among believers.\nMcLuhan further argues that the challenge lies not only in defending and preserving the\nsacredness of marriage among believers but also in scripturally restoring fellowship, self-respect,\nand forgiveness among the many individuals affected by divorce.\n\n38 www.alanknox.net/2007/07/ekklesia-and-kuriakon/: dated assessed- 20th October, 2014", "word_count": 375, "start_char": 70645, "end_char": 73181}

He supports this views Christ’s own statement about His mission in Luke 4:18,\nsuggesting that the church is tasked with continuing Christ's ministry on earth39.\nThe writer states that dedicated Christians who have been entangled in the complexities of\ndivorce often face the shame of being instantly labeled as spiritual pariahs and societal rejects by\nthe church.\nThe insights provided by David Kpobi and McLuhan are crucial sources of information for this\nstudy because it focuses on examining the church’s role in addressing the widespread issue of\ndivorce in our modern age. The researcher believes that the church's fundamental duty is to\npromote peace, comprehension, unity, and reconciliation in the world. Therefore, the church\nbears the responsibility of actively contributing to addressing the problem of divorce through\neducation on marriage, both before and after marriage. This study digs into how churches are\naddressing divorce cases and the individuals who have gone through divorce40.\nConsidering the above, the researcher aimed to explore how churches are handling divorce cases\nthrough pastoral care and counseling. Pastoral care and counseling are crucial for sustaining\nmarriages. What approaches can the Church adopt in its pastoral care? In the effort to stabilize\nmarital relationships, priests, pastors, and counselors in Ghana face a significant responsibility.\nThey must utilize all available means to guide married individuals towards a deeper\nunderstanding of themselves and each other within marriage, thereby strengthening their marital\nbonds. The role of pastors and counselors is to reduce confusion and foster healthy, Christian\nrelationships within families and society as a whole. Any pastoral models suggested for marriage\nmust align with the will of God as depicted in Holy Scripture41.\nThe church made efforts to counsel individuals in order to prevent divorces.

From these accounts, it's evident that\nthe church does try to counsel couples considering divorce, but often, individuals choose to\ndisengage from the church before significant intervention can occur43.\n4.4 Content of pre-marital counseling\nIn terms of the content covered in pre-marital counseling, counselors highlighted several key\nteachings including the Bible's perspective on marriage and singleness, the roles of husbands and\nwives, strategies for creating a happy home, common issues in Christian marriages, and sex\neducation for couples. These teachings are derived from a handbook used by counselors.\n4.5 Availability of post-marital counseling\nThe church view on divorce and how divorcees are handled in the church. The church under\nstudy firmly upholds the covenant concept of marriage, emphasizing the sanctity and\npermanence of the marital bond. Consequently, the church does not condone or tolerate divorce\nwithin marriages. Despite this stance, it became evident through interviews that the church has\nencountered instances of divorce among its members, and some marriages within the church are\ncurrently grappling with significant marital challenges.\nVarious reasons were cited for these divorces, including infidelity, misplaced priorities,\nirresponsibility, deception, sexual issues, long-distance marriages, interference from in-laws,\nlack of submission, and challenges related to childbirth.\nOne notable observation from the interviews was that many members who had gone through\ndivorce either left the church before the church became aware of the situation or departed when\nthe church attempted to intervene or provide redress. As a result, the church did not have any\nspecific programs or support structures in place for divorcees, as they often did not remain within\nthe church community after divorcing44.\n\n43 (Church of Uganda, n.d., p. 45)\n44 Smith, A.

Premarital counseling is seen as a strategic investment in the future of\ncouples embarking on marriage. While there are no absolute guarantees, engaging in premarriage counseling is about increasing the likelihood of success in marriage. During these\ncounseling sessions, couples delve into essential problem-solving skills, openly discuss their\nexpectations, identify their strengths and areas needing growth, and explore how their family\nbackgrounds might shape their marriage dynamics. This process equips them to be more\nunderstanding and prepared for the challenges that may arise. Research suggests that couples\nwho actively participate in premarital courses are less likely to consider divorce as an option45.\nRice's advocacy for three formal preparations – Premarital Education, Assessment, and\nCounseling – aligns with the belief that proper orientation is key to marriage success, supported\nby biblical wisdom (Proverbs 3:5-6). Rice advocates for the significance of three formal\npreparations crucial for successful marriages: Premarital Education, Premarital Assessment, and\nPremarital Counseling. This perspective aligns with the idea that proper orientation is key to\nachieving success in any endeavor. Just as professionals like medical officers or teachers\nundergo training for efficiency, couples benefit from structured marriage education comprising\nlectures, audio-visual aids, discussions, and role-playing exercises, which provide insights into\nestablishing a stable marital foundation46.\nHohman, Larson, and Harmer emphasize the importance of premarital assessment in preventing\npost-marital conflicts, advocating for thorough evaluations and critical examinations of potential\nproblem areas in marriage, as suggested by biblical passages like Matthew 18:15-17 and\nColossians 3:13. Hohman, Larson, and Harmer emphasize the importance of premarital\nassessment as a prerequisite for successful marriages. They suggest conducting thorough\nevaluations, including health assessments to ensure physical well-being and prevent sexually\ntransmitted diseases.

Addressing these issues before marriage can\nprevent conflicts that might escalate post-marriage.\nAnother goal highlighted by Holman, Larson, and Harmer is to normalize seeking professional\nhelp for future marital or family issues. This is crucial, especially in the Ugandan context where\nseeking professional assistance for marital challenges is not yet widely accepted. Often, couples\neither keep their problems private until they escalate or seek advice from biased sources like inlaws and friends, leading to further complications in their marriages. Encouraging couples to\nseek professional help promotes healthier communication and resolution of issues before they\nspiral out of control.\nThe researcher proposes implementing post-marital counseling within the church to provide\nongoing support and guidance to couples. This approach, rooted in Ephesians 5:22, aims to\nreinforce Biblical teachings and address hidden marital challenges proactively. The researcher\nsuggests implementing post-marital counseling within the church, extending support to couples\nfor at least the initial year after marriage. This ongoing counseling and oversight aim to reinforce\nthe importance of continuing to align with the teachings of the Bible. Essential aspects such as\nthe roles of husbands and wives, as outlined in Ephesians 5:22, should be continually\nemphasized even after marriage.\nIdeally, the counselor who guided the couple through pre-marital counseling should maintain\ncontact with them, visiting on a quarterly basis to assess their progress and address any emerging\nchallenges in their home life. The researcher suggests that maintaining continuity with the same\ncounselor raises trust and openness in the couple, facilitating more effective counseling sessions.\nThe researcher emphasizes that many couples face secret challenges that neither the church nor\nthe church leadership is aware of, leading to divorces before issues can be resolved. However,\nthrough the practice of post-marital counseling, these hidden issues could be brought to light and\naddressed. This approach seeks to prevent marital breakdowns by providing ongoing support and\nguidance to couples as they navigate the complexities of married life47.\n\n47 Hohman, J. M., Larson, D.

While it does not overlook instances of divorce within marriages,\nsignificant marital challenges have been observed within the church community. To address\nthese challenges, church ministers can take existing actions aligned with Biblical principles to\nreduce divorce rates and stand-in strong marriages. These actions include comprehensive\ncounseling, marriage improvement programs, spiritual guidance, community support, conflict\nresolution training, positive role modeling, collaboration with other organizations, advocacy for\nhealthy marriages and raising awareness about the impact of divorce. Such efforts will empower\nindividuals to review their vows on divorce and strengthen their commitment to marriage.\nFurthermore, the church's mission extends beyond proclamation; it involves revealing God’s\npurpose for humanity and presenting Jesus as the source of true life and meaning. This mission\ncompels Christians to actively live out their faith in their daily lives, addressing pressing issues\nsuch as divorce. For example, the church should collaborate with other organizations and\nprofessionals to offer comprehensive marriage support services, including access to qualified\ncounselors, therapists, and legal advisors when needed. Working together as a united body of\nbelievers, as emphasized in Biblical teachings, the church can provide holistic support to couples\nand families. Additionally, the church should advocate for policies and programs that support\nhealthy marriages and families, drawing from biblical principles of justice and compassion. By\nsetting a positive example of a healthy marriage, make straight standards set and demonstrating\ncommitment and perseverance as illustrated in the Song of Solomon, the church can\nmeaningfully contribute.", "word_count": 309, "start_char": 85265, "end_char": 87506}

God made male and female in His own image, and His main purpose for\nmarriage was for companionship. Throughout history, the beauty of marriage has been tarnished\nin all cultures by conflict, misunderstanding, resulting in marriage break ups. The study also\nemphasized the fact that the issue of divorce is very shocking and has now become a universal\nevil since it is found in all countries and cultures. In an attempt to address this issue, the study\nsurveyed the scriptures to understand what it has to say about marriage and divorce from Genesis\nto Revelation and focusing on Matthew 19:3-9 as the key verse for the study.\nThe study reviewed the Biblical background to the issues of marriage and divorce by looking at\nthe teachings of Genesis, the prophets, Jesus and the apostle Paul. The Biblical background\nfurther shows how the Scripture continually upholds marriage as a sacred and permanent\ncovenant, witnessed and protected by God. The study observed that marriage as a sacred\ncovenant was effectively used in the Old Testament to portray God’s relationship with Israel and\nin the New Testament to represent Christ’s relationship with His church. If God used marriage as\nany image to represent His commitment to His people, then it accepts that He regards marriage\nas a sacred, permanent covenant relationship. Since the disaster of divorce has consequence not\nonly on the couples but also on the children, the study also looked at its effects on children and\nthe following were gathered: stigmatized children dropping out of school, prostitution, armed\nrobbery, madness, premature death, murder, suicide, street children and juvenile crime, child\nabuse and financial difficulties.\nThe research also examined how church is responding to the issue of divorce. It was realized that\nthe church allocated three to six month for premarital counseling. There was no availability of\npost-marital counseling. It was also realized that it is only during wedding ceremonies or during\nannual celebration of family life week that teachings on marriage are presented from the pulpit.\nAgain, it was found out that there was no programs for divorcees in the church since those who\ndivorced did not stay in the church.

It was realized that the church has been hit by the issue of divorce\nand some marriages in the church have ended up in divorce whiles others are also facing serious\nmarital challenges. Since the church does not advocate for divorce, leaders who divorce are\nstripped off their leadership positions.\nThe researcher affirms that the Biblical view of marriage as a sacred and permanent covenant,\nwitnessed by God Himself, is crucial in responding to the secular marriage. From the researchers\nown examination it can be concluded that the divorce rate is on the control. Divorce rate is\nrampant among the young couples (those who marry in their early ages). It can also be concluded\nthat more and more young people are getting married from the Pentecostal, Charismatic and\nEvangelical churches. Nevertheless, the churches have of divorce which is attributed by to\nwestern cultural lifestyle and peer pressure. For instance some follow the soap operas which give\nwrong picture about marriage and the young people think what they see in these films are real,\nand as such when these expectations are not met their marriages lead to divorce. The other\nfactors that cause divorce include challenges in communication, bitterness, barrenness or\nchildlessness, adultery, desertion or abandonment, persistent conflicts and abuse.\nFrom the researcher’s findings it has come to light that the church have to lay down plans and\nprocedures in responding and dealing with the issue of divorce. Moreover, it is sad to say that a\nlot of pastors and marriage counselors are ill equipped to handle the issue of divorce in their\ncongregations.", "word_count": 315, "start_char": 89858, "end_char": 91787}

The rampant rate\nof which divorce has reached in our society is a reflection of how the sacredness of marriage has\nbeen dishonored. In order to uphold God’s standard of monogamous lifetime marriage, the\nresearcher recommends the following:\n1. Pastors and church leaders should be well trained in the Word of God as marriage counselors.\nPastors who have not had formal training should be encouraged to attend Bible Schools. The\nresearcher believes that this will contribute to their knowledge and broaden their limit in the\nteaching of marriage. It will further help them to develop better understanding on certain key\nmarital issues so that they can offer good counseling to people who find themselves in marital\ncrisis. Church leaders should pursue courses in exegesis and hermeneutics in order to be well\nequipped for better and accurate interpretation of the Word of God, especially Scripture texts that\ndeal with the issue of divorce.\n2. Churches must devote time to teach on marriage as they teach on topics such as salvation,\ntransformation, blessing and so on. Most sermons on marriage are preached during wedding\nceremonies and special marriage seminars. The subject of marriage and divorce should be taught\nmore frequently in churches.\n3. The church must play a lead role in educating the youth and married couples on issues related\nto sex. Sex education in marriage must be given much attention during counseling. This will go a\nlong way to help married partners to be satisfied with each other and to avoid extra marital\naffairs, thereby curbing the issue of divorce. This can clearly be seen from the assertion of the\nlawyer in charge of marriage and divorce at the end in divorce at their end is as a result of sex\nproblem.\n4. Counseling should be taken more seriously in the Churches. Emphasis must be laid on both\npre-marital and post-marital counseling and this should be done frequently. The researcher is of\nthe view that the church should institute post-marital counseling whereby couples will continue\nat least for the first year to receive counseling and some over sight and to get couples to\nunderstand why they need to continue to submit to the Word of God.

The youth should be taught and encouraged to establish themselves in their chosen professions\nbefore making marriage commitments so as to minimize the incidents of divorce among young\ncouples.\n6. The high cost of marriage must be addressed by the church. This is because many marriages\nthat have lasted long were not because the couples were rich.
