It is a Church that upholds and exploits spiritual gifts to bear spiritual\nfruits of the Spirit. The work of mission continues to be emphasized and people continue\nto surrender their lives to Christ. The Diocese has upheld holistic Christian values that\nliberate God’s people.\nThe Diocese has 17 Archdeaconries, 102 Parishes, and 417 Local Churches. It also has\n25 Chaplaincies that are vibrantly raising children and students in schools and colleges.\nThe recent (2023) internal Diocesan Census put the total population at 356,000 people.\nThe the archdeaconries include; Rwancerere, Kamuganguzi,Muyebe Kikungiri All saints\nkabale, Kamuronko, Kizinga, Nyabirerema, Buhangizi, Kihanga, Kantare, St.peters\nCathedral, Bubare, Nyaruhanga, Muko, Kacerere and Rukore archdeaconry where\nEmmanuel Rubaya church of Uganda Parish is located.\nThe Diocese covers the 3 Districts of Kabale, Rukiga, and Rubanda, and the Diocesan\nHeadquarters (Diocesan Offices and Cathedral) are located at Rugarama Hill in the\nCentre of Kabale Town.\nRubaya Church of Uganda started in 1944 at a place called Kyabagara which is found\ncurrently in kahungye sub county at the top of the hill where its sub parish Kyabagara\nis situated. It was led by late Elinest Bazira, followed by Mr Filipo Butozi and a wife to\nlate Rwemera called Elinora Bwandagara.\nIn 1946, it was shifted from Kyabagara to kitojo and by then,it was led by Mr Samuel\nNtonzi. In 1947, it was again shifted from kitojo to the current beautiful place which\n\nwas given in by late Bangamwabo in the exchange of the land in kitojo where it was\nbuilt.\n\nIn 1950, Rubaya Church of Uganda was granted a sub parish status (muluka) and given\nauthority to oversee eleven (11) local churches.

This is not\nsurprising because even Jesus’ disciples wanted to hinder them from accessing him\n(Mark 10:13-14). Research shows that Some Churches that have embraced children\nministry lack the element of holistic children ministry. Emphasis is put on memorization\nof bible verses but application is lacking. There is no standard curriculum, no official\nteaching materials, no professionally trained teachers, and facilities are also lacking.\nThe physical element is lacking because children are not taught healthy issues for\nexample taking care of their bodies and avoiding diseases. The social element is lacking\nbecause children are not given time to interact freely and have no mercy in what they\ndo, ego centric in their ways. Also, the cognitive/educational element is neglected for\nexample children have no chance to think about their careers and there is no\ndevelopment of livelihood skills. (Philip, 2016) According to World Vision the church\nneeds to reach out to people and especially children in a holistic way – spiritually,\nphysically, socially as well as economically. The church has a responsibility to invest in\nchildren and the time is now. (Mukhwana, 2015). Available records show that the church\nlacks a strong foundation of children ministry and because of that there are no wellgroomed Christians who can stand the test of time and carry on the church to the\ndesired growth. Christians today are swept by all kinds of teaching because they are\nnot well groomed spiritually, physically, socially and cognitively. The world lacks adults\nwith Christian principles to serve in various positions because they are not well groomed", "word_count": 449, "start_char": 12289, "end_char": 15154}

It goes beyond traditional Sunday school teaching to include\nmentorship, psychosocial support, life skills training, and community engagement. The\ngoal is to nurture the whole child in a manner that reflects biblical values and practical\ncare (Brewster, 2013; Myers, 2011).\nChurch\nIn this study, the term “Church” refers to the organized Christian community,\nspecifically the Emanuel Rubaya Church of Uganda Parish, functioning within the Rukore\nArchdeaconry of the Diocese of Kigezi. The church serves as both a religious and social\ninstitution, playing a central role in moral teaching, spiritual growth, and community\ndevelopment, particularly for children and youth (Kisembo, 2014).\n\nChild Development\nChild development in the context of this study refers to the progressive improvement\nof a child's capabilities across various domains that is,spiritual, cognitive, emotional,\nphysical, and social. It emphasizes nurturing children's potential through intentional,\nsupportive, and faith-based interventions provided by families, churches, and\ncommunities (Nabwami, 2020).", "word_count": 286, "start_char": 17285, "end_char": 19262}

This\nchapter involves the facts that have already been written about children and church\ngrowth/ development.\n2.1 Contributions of holistic children ministry to the church\nResearch indicates that a person’s lifelong behaviors and beliefs are generally\ndeveloped when they are young particularly before their teenage years.\nGlobally, the role of the church in child development has increasingly been recognized\nas a critical aspect of holistic ministry. Holistic child ministry seeks to address the\nspiritual, emotional, physical, and intellectual needs of children within the context of\nfaith communities. According to Brewster (2013), holistic child ministry integrates\nbiblical teaching with child-focused development strategies to ensure that children\ngrow in a nurturing and morally grounded environment. The church, as a spiritual and\nsocial institution, is uniquely positioned to influence children’s moral behavior,\ncharacter development, and community engagement from a young age.\nIn many parts of the world, churches have taken a proactive approach by developing\nchild-focused ministries that combine education, health awareness, mentorship, and\nspiritual growth. As per Myers (2011), such initiatives often collaborate with families,\nschools, and community leaders to build a strong support network around the child.

This global framework establishes the foundation for understanding the\nimportance of holistic child ministry within local church settings such as Emanuel\nRubaya Church of Uganda Parish.\nIn the African context, the church has historically played a significant role in shaping\nthe moral and social development of children. African communities, particularly in rural\nsettings, regard the church not only as a religious institution but also as a pillar of\ncommunal life. According to Kasambala (2006), the African church has evolved into a\ncenter for education, social support, and moral instruction, especially for the young.\nChild-focused ministries have become increasingly necessary in addressing challenges\nsuch as poverty, family instability, and limited access to formal education.\nIn many parts of Africa, churches run Sunday schools, youth fellowships, and\neducational programs aimed at equipping children with life skills and ethical values. A\nstudy by Moyo & Sibanda (2019) emphasized that holistic child ministry is particularly\neffective when church programs intentionally include mentorship, recreational\nactivities, and practical life guidance, thereby helping children avoid societal pitfalls\nlike early substance abuse or delinquency. African churches that incorporate a holistic\napproach often report stronger youth engagement and better long-term moral\noutcomes for the children involved.\nUganda presents a unique context for holistic child ministry due to its strong Christian\nheritage and predominantly young population.

A study by Nabwami (2020) found that when churches integrate spiritual\nteachings with practical services like health education and academic support, children\nare more likely to exhibit positive behavioral and academic outcomes. The church is\ntherefore a vital actor in ensuring that children not only learn about faith but also\nexperience practical love and support from their religious communities.\nWithin the Diocese of Kigezi, and specifically the Rukore Archdeaconry, the Emanuel\nRubaya Church of Uganda Parish stands as a model for grassroots holistic child ministry.\nLocated in a rural and mountainous area of southwestern Uganda, the parish has made\nsignificant efforts to minister to children through integrated programs. According to a\nlocal report by Rukore Archdeaconry (2023), the church runs a vibrant Sunday school\nand youth fellowship that focus on character formation, biblical literacy, and life skills\ntraining. These programs are led by dedicated volunteers and lay readers who recognize\nthe importance of early moral and spiritual guidance.\nHolistic child ministry in Emanuel Rubaya Parish includes not only spiritual formation\nbut also psychosocial support.

A recent study by Rukore Child Outreach Team (2024) revealed\nthat children involved in church programs at Emanuel Rubaya Parish demonstrated\nhigher levels of empathy, discipline, and community participation than their peers who\nwere not engaged. The church has also initiated peer mentorship groups, where older\nyouths guide younger ones in spiritual matters and personal growth, promoting\nintergenerational support within the congregation.\nMoreover, the church actively collaborates with parents and guardians, recognizing that\nholistic child development requires a collective effort. According to Tumuhimbise\n(2023), parental involvement in church-led child programs has led to more stable family\nenvironments and reduced incidents of behavioral issues among participating children.\nBy integrating faith, community service, education, and psychosocial care, Emanuel\nRubaya Church exemplifies how rural parishes can implement holistic ministry models\nthat are contextually relevant and spiritually transformative.\nResearch indicates that a person’s lifelong behaviors and beliefs are generally\ndeveloped when they are young particularly before their teenage years.\nAccording to Barna 2003, a person’s moral foundations are generally in place by age 9.\nAfter that age, most people simply refine their views. A person’s response to Jesus (and\nthe gospel concerning his life, death and resurrection) is usually determined before age\n18. For most Americans, the response is set by age 12. A person’s spiritual beliefs are\nset in place when they are preteens. Those beliefs include the nature of God, the\nexistence of Satan, the reliability of the Bible, the afterlife, Jesus Christ, the means of\ngaining God’s favor, and the influence of spiritual forces in a person’s life.

(Barna, 2003)\n\nBarna noted that adult church leaders usually had significant involvement in the church\nwhen they were children. Thus, those who will become the church’s leaders 20 years\nfrom now are probably active in children’s church programs today. Children ministry\nplays a crucial role in grooming leaders for today and tomorrow. In his journal\nequipping children for ministry, Ted Johnstone says “I was visiting a congregation on\nthe East coast and a couple of young girls about age 10 circulated through the\ncongregation, receiving the offering in baskets. They then brought the baskets to the\nfront and joined an adult to offer a prayer of thanksgiving. They did a marvelous job—\nclearly, they had been equipped for this work.” When children are exposed to ministry\nopportunities at an early age, they will serve even in their adult years. (Johnston, 2022)\nChildren ministry teaches child discipline for example, it teaches children how to\nrespect authority and to have good manners. Discipline is core for the success of any\nchild in life and a child cannot get discipline anywhere else apart from the church.\nPsalms 1:7 states that “the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom” following God’s\nlaws at an early age allows a child to grow up with discipline and it is through discipline\nthat they attain knowledge.\n\nChildren’s ministry provides kids with opportunities to help the community, such as\ndoing acts of good and feeding the poor. Children learn to offer service to the\ncommunity through Sunday school and other children’s programs. For example, through\nthe compassion sponsorship program children are given opportunity to do acts of service\nin the community such as cleaning the well, fetching water for the elderly, cleaning\n\npremises for old people’s homes and distributing some household items to families of\nneedy people. ElizabethScott. (2022).\n\nChildren ministry gives a chance to children to accept Jesus Christ. Research has proven\nthat kids tend to be more receptive to the Gospel than any other age group. Belief in\nJesus at a tender age, helps children to avoid some negative outcomes of sin. Only\nGod’s grace can change our hearts, but knowing the consequences of disobeying God is\noften a wakeup call. When children understand the great price that Jesus paid for their\nsalvation, they are more likely to stay on the way of the righteous.

Children ministry helps children\nto meet together through different activities, as they participate in those activities,\nthey get to know each other and make friendships. Friendships made at church at such\nan early age are usually lasting friendships. For example, children supported by\nagencies such as world vision and compassion international are exposed to different\nprograms both spiritual, physical, social and educational which help them to interact\nwith each other hence forming long lasting friendships that even help them in the future\nlong after their education. (Sharma, 2023)\nIt helps children to discover and intervene in abusive home situations. This is something\nwe rarely address. But the church is often one of the few safe places on Earth for abused\nchildren. The church is a place where children can easily interact with their teachers\n\nand through this interaction teachers are able to discover what takes place within a\nchild’s life. These interactions help children to share their stories about their homes\nand community hence when there is abuse in a child’s life, the teacher is able to\ndiscover it and take appropriate measures to rescue the child.

(Sharma, 2023)\n\nChildren ministry supports Godly parenting. Godly parenting is very crucial for raising\nGod fearing children with both knowledge and discipline. This is done through parent/\ncaregiver seminars which are intended to educate parents and caregivers about their\nrole in parenting. The church was never meant to be the exclusive faith teacher of\nchildren. Instead, God’s plan was for the two institutions (church and family) to form a\npartnership. Through these seminars parents and caregivers are helped to fulfil their\ncalling by involving them in the ministry, providing them with resources and training\nthem in family discipleship which helps parents and caregivers to carry on the ministry\noutside church premises which is very crucial in ministry sustainability. (Caplan, 1989)\nHolistic child ministry helps caregivers to acquire some skills through sensitizations.\nChildren ministry programs which emphasize parent/ caregiver involvement usually\nhelp in empowering them with different skills through sensitizations. For example,\nthrough compassion international children ministry, parents and caregivers are usually\ninvited for sensitizations such as nutritional sensitizations, family planning\nsensitizations and disease prevention sensitizations. Such skills have a great impact on\nfamily and community. They help families to know the number of children they should\nhave at a given time depending on the available resources. They learn how to feed their\n\nchildren on the foods that are appropriate for their age so that they grow as healthy\nvessels for the work of God. (Ministry, 2023)", "word_count": 273, "start_char": 29577, "end_char": 31401}

(Ministry, 2023)\n\nHolistic child ministry brings unchurched families in contact with the Gospel. In our\nculture, reaching children is one of the most effective ways to make contact with\nunchurched families. A children’s program at church acts as a point of contact between\nthe church and the children’s families. Churches with such programs usually also have\ntimes when they do home visitations, through home visitations, they are able to\nminister to the entire family, that is, the siblings and the parents/ caregivers. In so\ndoing the gospel is spread to the entire family. For example, the World outreach\nministry has reached more than three billion people through its children’s ministry since\n1932 (Ministry, 2023)\nHolistic child ministry helps the church to pass on the faith. In every period of church\nhistory, this has been a struggle. Children’s ministry helps the church in raising a\ngeneration of Christians who deeply understand their faith. This is achieved when the\nchurch has a comprehensive plan for Christian education. The Sunday school curriculum\nis very essential in helping children acquire spiritual knowledge necessary to equip them\nwith the basic biblical knowledge. This curriculum is designed according to the church\ncalendar hence it helps the children to learn the church seasons from advent through\neaster, Pentecost and Trinity. (Barna, 2003)\nHolistic child ministry helps train future church leaders. When children are given chance\nto lead their peers through bible reading, leading praise, leading small groups, leading\n\nintercessions among others, they acquire leadership skills that will even help them\nwhen they are adults. Leadership skills allow children to have control of their lives and\nthe ability to make things happen. Leadership instills confidence, and helps children\nsolve problems creatively, work in a team, and work collaboratively with others.\nLeadership gives children many opportunities to develop responsibility. There is some\ndebate whether some children are “born leaders” or they “learn to be” leaders. All\nchildren have the potential to develop leadership skills. Leadership development can\nbe a lifelong process. As adults, we can teach the skills necessary for children to take\non leadership roles now and in the future.

(Care, 2019)\n\nHolistic child ministry raises community awareness of the church through special\nevents. Special events such as sports gala, music dance and drama attract people from\nall walks of life and as they come for such events, they become aware of the church\nand its programs. Events such as talent competitions – a day where kids get together to\nshowcase their talents is a great church event idea to get parents and children involved.\nIt even brings on board the elderly (grandma and grandpa) as cheerers of their precious\nlittle ones. (Sharma, 2023)\nHolistic child ministry helps big church go smoothly. Quality childcare is essential to\nallow parents to participate fully in the church worship service. As children are being\nattended to by their teachers, parents and caregivers, get time to concentrate in the\nadult service. Some churches which are more advanced have child care centers for even\ntoddlers. For example, churches in Chicago western suburbs give parents the\n\nopportunity to embrace weekly religious services without the struggle of caring their\nchildren. Drop-off nurseries and children’s Bible school for preschool-aged children give\nparents the ability to connect with their faith, all while knowing their children are being\ncared for. ElizabethScott. (2022).\nHolistic child ministry helps build a strong youth ministry. Children who grow up in child\nministry become leaders in the student ministry. Children ministry produces vibrant\nyouth who carry on the youth ministry as youth leaders, choir leaders, church machine\noperators and even Sunday school teachers. There can never be a vibrant youth ministry\nin a church where there is no vibrant children ministry. An intentional focus on\nchildren’s and youth ministry results in more young people growing in their maturity of\nfaith, more young people inviting their friends to church, and more young people\ncontinuing in their faith post high school. The Anglican Church in Australia has declared\nthat “We are seeing young people influencing their parents and whole households\ncoming to investigate Christ and his church through the godly witness of their children.\nAdditionally, we are seeing all age groups in the church flourish as disciples of Jesus as\nthey witness and participate in the church’s investment in ministry to children and\nyouth.” (Beilharz, 2021)", "word_count": 421, "start_char": 33349, "end_char": 36008}

A tried-and-true way to\npromote learning is to teach on different maturity levels. Grouping children of the same\nage in a class is believed to meet the learning needs of the majority, the assumption\nbeing that children of the same age have similar levels of socio-emotional and cognitive\n\ndevelopment; that their early childhood developmental trajectories, as well as inputs\nfrom their home environment, prepare them equally to meet the demands of formal\nschooling. Curricular expectations and teaching-learning materials are designed based\non this assumption. (Thomas, 2022)\n2.3 The challenges hindering the holistic development of children ministry\nA critical challenge is the scarcity of adequately trained personnel to manage and lead\nchildren's ministry programs. Many church leaders and volunteers lack formal training\nin child development and pedagogy, leading to suboptimal delivery of ministry\nactivities. This gap in expertise affects the effectiveness of spiritual and moral guidance\nprovided to children (Kisembo, 2014).\nIn some communities, children are not perceived as active participants in church life.\nThis cultural mindset leads to their marginalization in decision-making processes and\nministry activities. Such attitudes undermine efforts to engage children holistically,\nlimiting their opportunities for spiritual and personal growth within the church setting\n(Kasambala, 2006).\nThe physical infrastructure of many rural churches, including Emanuel Rubaya Parish,\nis often inadequate to support children's ministry programs. Lack of proper classrooms,\nplay areas, and sanitation facilities creates an environment that is not conducive to\neffective learning and development for children (Rukore Archdeaconry report, 2023).\nParental engagement is crucial for the holistic development of children. However, many\nparents in the community are either unaware of or indifferent to the importance of", "word_count": 309, "start_char": 35810, "end_char": 37982}

This lack of participation\nhinders the reinforcement of church teachings at home, affecting the overall\ndevelopment of children (Nabwami, 2020).\nThe prevailing socio-economic hardships faced by families in the region contribute to\nchildren's neglect in ministry programs. Economic constraints force children to\nprioritize labor over education and spiritual activities, leading to absenteeism and\ndisengagement from church programs (Nanteza, 2020).\nGender biases within the community can lead to unequal opportunities for boys and\ngirls in participating in church activities. Girls, in particular, may face cultural\nrestrictions that limit their involvement in certain programs, thereby hindering their\nholistic development (Kasambala, 2016).\nThe lack of a structured and consistent approach to children's ministry results in\nfragmented and ineffective programs. Without a clear curriculum and regular activities,\nchildren receive disjointed teachings, which diminishes the impact of the ministry on\ntheir development (Rukore Archdeaconry reports, 2023).\nMany children in the community face emotional and psychological challenges, yet the\nchurch lacks formal counseling services to address these issues. The absence of trained\ncounselors and structured programs leaves children without the necessary support to\nnavigate personal difficulties (Kisembo, 2014).\nChildren are often exposed to negative peer influences that conflict with the values\ntaught in church. The church's limited engagement with the broader community makes\n\nit challenging to counteract these influences effectively, leading to moral and\nbehavioral isses among children (Mwita & Mwikali, 2022).\n\nThe integration of technology in children's ministry is minimal, limiting the church's\nability to engage children through modern educational tools. Incorporating technology\ncould enhance learning experiences and make ministry programs more appealing to the\nyounger generation (Brewster, 2013).\nThe church's outreach programs often fail to reach all children in the community,\nespecially those from marginalized backgrounds. This exclusion prevents a significant\nportion of the child population from benefiting from the church's holistic development\ninitiatives (Rukore Archdeaconry reports, 2023).\nThe absence of adequate spiritual role models within the church community affects\nchildren's moral and spiritual development. Without positive examples to emulate,\nchildren may struggle to internalize and practice the teachings imparted during ministry\nprograms (Kasambala, 2016).\nThere is often an overemphasis on academic success at the expense of spiritual and\nmoral education. This imbalance leads to the neglect of holistic development, where\nchildren's emotional and spiritual needs are overlooked in favor of academic\nperformance (Nabwami, 2020).", "word_count": 441, "start_char": 37615, "end_char": 40859}

Traditional practices and reluctance to innovate can prevent the church from\nimplementing effective programs that address the evolving needs of children in the\ncommunity (Kisembo, 2014).\n2.3 The possible ways through which holistic children ministry can be improved at\nchurches\nChildren ministry can be improved through a holistic approach to ensure each child’s\nindividual needs are supported, holistic child ministry is tailored to a child’s age,\ngender, health, culture and family situation. When a child is enrolled in child ministry,\nthey should receive spiritual guidance through the church, but should also be helped\nthrough family support programs to have access to nutritious food, access to clean\nwater, quality health care and emotional support, alongside education and skills-based\ntraining. For example, Compassion’s holistic child development model is designed to\nhelp children grow up to become thriving followers of Jesus who are positively\ninfluencing their world. its programs focus not only on the spiritual but also the social\nemotional, physical and cognitive aspects. (Noakes, 2022)\nIn order to improve children ministry, there is need to develop and equip a team to\ncarry on the ministry. This should be done prayerfully by identifying and extending a\npersonal invitation to potential coworkers. When you ask someone to join the team,\ntell them what’s expected, clarify what they will do, and describe how they’ll be\nsupported and trained. The church should identify children ministry workers who\nqualify, who have a good moral background and invest in training them and giving them", "word_count": 318, "start_char": 40431, "end_char": 42563}

Building and\nequipping a children’s ministry team also involves motivation, supervision and\nsupporting the team with resources. (Linda, 2016)\nImproving children’s Ministry requires a compelling vision. A clear and compelling vision\nstatement tells people what you aspire to achieve – why you exist – what is the good\nyou seek to create in the world. It also tells those you want to convince to join you for\nexample, funders, partners, clients/audiences why what you are doing is important. To\nenvision is to imagine, plan beforehand, or ponder the possibilities. What has God\nplaced in your heart and mind? People need to know the why and where of children\nministry is. A clear vision helps the congregation visualize a future that’s appealing and\ncaptivating which enables them to support the ministry.\nChildren ministry should be Christ-centered and Scripture-rich. Major in the Gospels,\nespecially with younger children. Bible studies should prioritize knowing and growing a\nrelationship with Jesus. Avoid curriculum that emphasizes values, morals, heroes, or\nbehavior modification. The bible has everything needed for the holistic development of\na person. 2Timothy 3:16-17 states “all Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for\nteaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the servant of God\nmay be thoroughly equipped for every good work. The bible is the source of all the\nwisdom needed to thrive in this world. When children have a strong spiritual foundation,\nthey can thrive well in other aspects.

Research indicates\nthat most local churches are running programs and activities; yet don’t have a\ndeliberate short- and long-term plan for evangelizing and discipline children. A good\nchild ministry strategy includes planning for new members, child safety, making child\nministry interesting by including play, investing in a curriculum among others.\n(Union, 2019)\nChildren should be taught how to read the bible using bible reading guides. This helps\nthem to develop a bible reading culture at an early age. The guide also helps them to\ninterpret the scripture in the right context. For example, scripture union guides have\nhelped many people to read the bible over the years. Scripture union resources such as\nGod and me, daily power and daily guide are useful resources that can help children as\nthey study and read the word of God. (Linda, 2016)\nIn order to improve children ministry, families must be supported as partners in the\nministry. Parents/ caregivers should be helped to embrace and excel as the primary\ndisciples of their children. There is need to share the best resources for families.\nChildren ministry workers/ church leaders should provide advice, assistance, spiritual\ncounsel, and a deeper level of dialogue about family faith formation.

When you do\noutreaches to schools, children get to know you and they will follow you at the church.\nUse motivational gifts such as sending birthday cards to families with children. Rather\nthan waiting for kids to come to church, take ministry to where kids already are. To\nattract unchurched kids, consider locating activities in a store front, park, or\nrecreational center. (Barna, 2003)\nIn order for children ministry to thrive, it should be inclusive. Welcome children of all\nabilities, exceptionalities, ethnicities, and backgrounds.

The design applied both qualitative and quantitative\nmethods to data collection and analysis. A cross-sectional design is a kind of design that\ninvolves measuring different variables in the population of interest at a single point in\ntime. The design is suitable for the study because it helped in determining the\nrelationship between variables.

To ensure validity of the instruments,\nthe researcher consulted two experienced senior researchers and find out whether they\ngave the information that seek to answer questions of the study. Content Validity Index\n(CVI) was computed to establish validity of the instruments.\n3.9.2 Reliability of Instruments\nReliability is the tendency to obtain the same results if the measure is to be repeated\nby using the same subjects under the same conditions (Hjelmand Atwine, 2011). For\nthe case of the study, reliability is ensured by standardizing the questionnaire through\npre-testing. Questionnaires were pre-tested from a sample outside the target sample\nbut with similar or close demographic characteristics to those of the study area.\nReliability of the questionnaire in relation to the consistency of the respondents’\nanswers was computed using the Cronbach’s Alpha Coefficient.\n3.10 Data management and analysis\n3.10.1 Data Management\nThe data collected was cleaned, edited and coded to avoid incompleteness during\nentry. Minor mistakes committed during data collection were corrected in the field.\n\nUpon the completion of data collection and editing in the field, systematic organization\nof raw data was done to facilitate data analysis. Questionnaires with missing variables,\ninformation or mistakes were left out.\n3.10.2 Data Analysis\nData was analyzed under two major principles that is quantitative and qualitative\nanalysis\n3.10.3 Quantitative Data Analysis\nThe data collected have been cleaned, coded and demographic characteristics of the\nrespondents were described using largely descriptive statistics such as frequencies and\npercentages. Bivariate analysis was used to identify the significant factors limiting\nsuccess of Sunday school programs. The outcome of the analysis was presented in\nstatistical tables.\n3.10.4 Qualitative Data Analysis\nQualitative data was analyzed by developing themes (headings) or sub themes, which\nwas derived from the study objectives. The recorded information was transcribed\nverbatim and translated from local languages into English. Observational field notes\nwere incorporated into the data for analysis. The transcripts have been read repeatedly\nand words with similar meanings grouped into categories. Similar categories were\ngrouped into themes and subthemes which were presented as results", "word_count": 434, "start_char": 53782, "end_char": 56773}

Further approval was obtained from the leaders of\nEmanuel church Rubaya Church of Uganda and finally informed consent from the\nparticipants themselves. Participants were guaranteed confidentiality of the\ninformation collected. This was preceded by thorough explanation of the aim and\nobjective of the study. Participation was based on informed and voluntary consent.\nRespondents for the study were informed of their right to withdraw from the study at\nany time they deemed necessary. They were fully assured of their confidentiality and\nanonymity. Confidentiality of data was maintained by use of identification numbers\nrather than names and limiting access to the data. The questionnaire administered to\nthe in-patients were prefaced with a consent form requesting consent of the\nrespondents before participation in the study.\n3.12 Ethical Consideration\nConfidentiality of the information was provided to the respondents. To ascertain the\npractice of ethics in this study, the following activities were implemented by the\nresearcher.\nAll the questionnaires to the respondents were coded instead of reflecting the names\nthat provided anonymity of the respondents.\n\nCHAPTER FOUR: DATA PRESENTATION AND ANALYSIS OF FINDINGS\n4.0\nThis chapter presented the analysis and interpretation of the results obtained from the\nfield study of investigating the distribution of holistic children ministry to the church\nwith particular focus on Emmanuel Rubaya church of Uganda Parish. Questionnaires\nwere administered to 36 respondents. All the thirty-six respondents ably answered and\nreturned the questionnaires giving a response rate of 100%.\n4.1 Social- economic characteristics of respondents.\nThis sub-section presents the social – economic features of 36(thirty-six respondents\nsampled. The key demographic characteristics captured for the study included; gender,\nage bracket, marital status, education levels, occupation, employment status, house\nhold size and the type of house hold. These features were found to be of great help in\nclearly depicting the diverse background of the sample population.\nTable 2: Socia-demographic characteristics of the respondents.\nTable 2: Socio-demographic Characteristics of the Respondents\nSocial-demographic\nCharacteristics\nFrequency\nPercentage (%)\nGender of respondents\nMale\n38.9%\nFemale\n61.1%\n\nRespondents’ Age Bracket\n\nUnder 23\n41.7%\n24–35\n13.9%\n35+\n44.4%\nMarital Status of Respondents\nSingle\n41.7%\nMarried\n58.3%\nSeparated\n0.0%\nWidow\n0.0%\nLevel of Education\nNone\n13.9%\nPrimary\n41.7%\nSecondary\n27.8%\nUniversity\n30.6%\nOccupation/Livelihood Source\nFarming\n27.8%\nSalary\n13.9%\nBusiness\n16.7%\nNone\n41.7%\nType of Household\nMale-headed\n100.0%\nFemale-headed\n0.0%", "word_count": 448, "start_char": 56411, "end_char": 59606}

The\nhigher number of female respondents may be attributed to the fact that women are\noften more involved in children’s ministry programs within church settings. In many\nrural Ugandan churches, mothers play a more active role in Sunday school, caregiving,\nand community-based child support initiatives, making them more accessible and\nengaged during such studies.\nRespondents’ Age Bracket\nThe age distribution shows that 15 respondents (41.7%) were under 23 years, 5 (13.9%)\nwere between 24-35 years, and 16 (44.4%) were aged 35 and above. The significant\nnumber of respondents under 23 reflects the involvement of youth and young adults in\nchurch activities, particularly as volunteers in children’s ministry. Meanwhile, the\nstrong representation of those above 35 indicates the influence of older adults and\nparents, who often serve as mentors, leaders, or teachers in church programs.\nMarital Status of Respondents\nThe majority of respondents were married, making up 21 (58.3%) of the total, while 15\n(41.7%) were single. There were no respondents who identified as separated or\nwidowed. The high proportion of married individuals is likely due to the demographic\ncomposition of the church community, where adult, family-oriented members are more\n\nengaged in church leadership and children’s ministry. Their marital status allows them\nto relate more directly with parenting and child development issues, which are central\nto the study.\nLevel of Education\nRegarding education levels, 5 respondents (13.9%) had no formal education, 15 (41.7%)\nhad primary education, 10 (27.8%) had secondary education, and 11 (30.6%) had\nuniversity education. This distribution suggests a mixed educational background within\nthe parish. The predominance of primary education aligns with the rural setting of the\nparish, where access to higher education may be limited. However, the presence of\nrespondents with university education is notable and may indicate increasing\neducational attainment among younger or urban-connected members of the parish.\nOccupation/Livelihood Source\nIn terms of occupation, 10 respondents (27.8%) were farmers, 5 (13.9%) earned salaries,\n6 (16.7%) were involved in business, and 15 (41.7%) reported having no source of\nincome. Farming is a common livelihood in rural Uganda and therefore features\nprominently. The high number of respondents without any occupation suggests a\nconsiderable level of economic dependency or unemployment, which could include\nstudents, stay-at-home caregivers, or youth. This socio-economic challenge may impact\nthe effectiveness of children’s ministry due to financial constraints in supporting church\nprograms.", "word_count": 408, "start_char": 59606, "end_char": 62396}

This complete dominance of maleheaded households reflects the traditional patriarchal structure that is prevalent in\nrural Ugandan societies, where men are culturally recognized as the heads of families.\nThis has implications for how decisions regarding children's spiritual development and\nparticipation in church activities are made, as male household heads may influence\nfamily-level engagement with church programs.\n4.2\nThe contribution of holistic children ministry programme to Emmanuel\nRubaya Church of Uganda Parish.\nThis section of the study addresses research objective two which sought to determine\nthe the contribution of children ministry programs on church growth.\nDavid Tiwangye the senior warden of Emmanuel Rubaya church of Uganda Parish a 67year man said that children ministry programs are breeding ground for potential leaders\nfor the church and community.
