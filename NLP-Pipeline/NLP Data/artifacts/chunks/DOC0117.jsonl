Instead of importing goods and services, tourists decide to visit a\ncountry and undertake activities of their own choice, directly benefiting the domestic\neconomy through the businesses and services catering to their needs. This realization\nof the significance of tourism in local economies led to its sudden growth, especially\namong developing countries with emerging economies. Tourism, in consequence,\nturned out to be one of the fastest-growing industries in the world.\nFollowing the definition, tourism includes activities of people traveling to places\nother than their usual environment for a continuous period up to one year for\npurposes like leisure, business, and others. During recent decades, international\ntourism has developed into a global phenomenon. Despite the recent global economic\ncrisis, world tourism recorded in 2010 a very strong recovery, even better than\nforecast. Tourism arrivals in 2010 alone rose by 6.7 percent, therefore reversing the\n4.0 percent decline recorded in the previous year (UNWTO, 2011).\nThe tourism industry worldwide has been bouncing back with much resilience from\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, and the international tourist arrivals reached about 70% of\nthe pre-pandemic levels in 2022. However, the tourism sector of Nepal has not\nrecovered yet, and the arrival of foreign visitors is estimated to have reached\napproximately 600,000 people in 2022-way below the record-high number of 1.2\nmillion people recorded in 2019.

Accordingly, with the global tourism industry still rebounding, Nepal\nshould be positioned to regain momentum and continue to build on its natural beauty,\nrich cultural heritage, and a fast-growing reputation as a destination for adventure\ntourism.\nTourism is an significant partner in the Ugandan economy, with estimated revenues\nderived from this industry being about 7.7% of the country's GDP in 2022. The case\nstudy will be on Lake Mburo National Park in Western Uganda, describing the major\narea of effect that tourism has had on economic development within the region. It\nhas directly generated employment and income for the people within its vicinity\nthrough entry fees, guided tours, and accommodation therein. This revenue, arising\nbecause of tourism, has a multiplier effect on the local economy, abetting businesses\nin all aspects, from agriculture to retail. Because of this fact, the park had spurred\nsupporting infrastructure growth and yielded more investments in the region, and this\nhas deeply helped in stimulating economic growth. Tourism has helped preserve the\nlocal communities' cultural heritage and also induced ownership and pride feelings.\nNeedless to say, this needs to be done in such a way that there is a balance between\ntourism promotion and management of the park's natural resources for sustainability\nand equitable distribution of the economic proceeds at the grassroots level.", "word_count": 303, "start_char": 11158, "end_char": 13110}

Most literature that is available tends to center on the\nmore well-known Uganda mountain gorillas, which up until now, have been the\nhighlight of Uganda's tourism development efforts (Gotanegre, 1992; Shackley, 1995).\nRealizing the potential such a valuable resource, more lately, members of the\nUganda's tourism industry have come to realize the need to broaden the country's\ntourism products. This chapter presents discussions on the historical development of,\nand major shifting faces in, tourism's role within the economy of Uganda by\nemphasizing particularly the orientation of the industry towards international tourism\nand gorilla tourism.\nLocated in southwestern Uganda along the border with Tanzania, Lake Mburo National\nPark takes its name from Lake Mburo, the major feature in this park. The Akagera\nRiver forms part of the eastern boundary, adding to the collection of lakes on the\nwest, where the biggest is Lake Ihema. The park's landscape encompasses undulating\nrolling hills mixed with Acacia and Brachystegia Woodland; numerous grasslands; and\nlakes, which have swamps around them. All these put together give Lake Mburo\nNational Park a charming combination that makes it a place of stunning scenic\nbeauty.\n1.1 Statement of the problem\nLake Mburo National Park in Western Uganda has for some time now been a\nconsiderable tourist destination, receiving high volumes of visitors annually.

In this\nchapter, I summarize various relevant studies and expert views in respect to the\ncontribution the tourism industry has made towards the economic development of the\nsurrounding communities, the challenges faced by the tourism sector, and the link\nbetween tourism and economic growth in Uganda.\n2.1 Definition of key terms.\nTourism: These are the activities of people who travel to and stay in places other\nthan their usual environment for not more than one consecutive year for leisure,\nbusiness, or any other purpose. In this regard, tourism for the purpose of this study\nshall mean any visitor activity within Uganda for a period less than one year.\nEconomic Development: Economic development involves the enhancement of\nstandards of living, amelioration of economic and political factors, and social\ndevelopment of a nation or region. It involves increasing the productive capacity of a\ncountry, diversifying the economy, infrastructure development, and enhancing\ncitizens' standards of living.\nDirect Economic Impacts: The direct economic impacts refer to the immediate effects\nthat\nare\nproduced\nthrough\ntourism\nexpenditure,\nsuch\nas\nreceipts\nfrom", "word_count": 383, "start_char": 23094, "end_char": 25844}

Multiplier Effect: Multiplier effect means successive\nrounds of spending and respending of tourist-related income that generate additional\neconomic activities, increasing overall economic output above and beyond that\nprovided by the initial tourism expenditure.\n2.2. The direct economic benefits accruing from tourism activities related to Lake\nMburo National Park in the form of park entrance fees, accommodation, food and\nbeverages sold, as well as other tourism-related services.\nLiterature has shown that tourism activities at Lake Mburo National Park have\nbenefited the region in terms of direct economic benefits. A recent study by\nTumwesigye et al. 2021 estimated that the revenue generated by this park, from\ndifferent sources related to tourism in 2019, has been more than US$2.5 million. This\nincludes income from the entrance fees paid by the visitors, accommodation booking\nincome, and various other tourism-related services and amenities available within the\npark area. For example, tourism packages at Lake Mburo also involve game drives,\nboat cruises, and guided nature walks, which equally attract domestic and", "word_count": 277, "start_char": 25532, "end_char": 27484}

This\ninflux of tourism dollars supports not only the operations and conservation work of\nthe Uganda Wildlife Authority, managing the National Park, but also creates\nsignificant spillover benefits to local communities through the stimulation of local\neconomies and the employment of people in industries that can meet the needs of\npark visitors.\nTourism benefits accruing to Lake Mburo National Park are even more than revenues\ncollected by the park itself. According to Kiwango et al. (2022), studies indicate that\ntourism spending by visitors to the park injects an estimated annual US$3.8 million\ninto the local economy. This level of tourism expenditure is channeled through direct\npurchases of goods and services made by the park visitors themselves, from\naccommodation and food to transportation, guiding services, and even the buying of\nlocally produced handicrafts and souvenirs. These tourism dollars injected into the\nlocal economy have a multiplier effect: the initial spending by the visitors circulates\nthrough the community, generating additional economic activities, income, and\nemployment opportunities for the residents in businesses and industries that support\npark tourism operations. This direct economic incentive is thus one of the essential\nmechanisms by which the presence of Lake Mburo National Park and its dynamic\ntourism industry can contribute to the overall well-being and growth of the entire\nsurrounding region\nTourism within the surroundings of Lake Mburo National Park has proven to be a\nvaluable driver in employment and income generation among the communities in this\narea.

Tourism\njobs ensure steady, certain incomes to keep them and their households going. These\ntourism jobs are so important because they can provide regular sources of income to\nmembers so that they can meet their basic needs, invest in family well-being, and\nengage more productively in the local economy. In this regard, Lake Mburo National\nPark has become an integral part of economic stability and development in local\ncommunities surrounding the park by absorbing the largest portion of the workforce in\nits tourism activities. Tourism in Lake Mburo National Park spreads beyond the\nimmediate benefits accruable in creating employment. There is indeed a powerful\nmultiplier effect in that tourism-related jobs spur ancillary business growth in\ncommunities surrounding the national parks.

Indeed,\nstudies conducted in 2020 have elicited a potent multiplier effect: jobs resulting from\ntourism cause additional indirect and induced employment within surrounding\ncommunities.\nThis was because, with the locals securing regular incomes from their engagement in\nthe park's tourism products and guiding services in 2020, such as game drives and\naccommodation, they in return spent their earnings on patronizing other local\nbusinesses. This resulted in an increase in the tourism-derived income that catalyzed\nthe opening and proliferation of different types of small businesses in 2020, including\ncraft shops, restaurants, and transportation services (Rwakakamba & Lukwago, 2019;\nNamara & Uwimbabazi, 2021). Besides, these ancillary economic activities provided\nmore sources of income and opened up more avenues of entrepreneurship.\nAmong those service-based industries, tourism at Lake Mburo National Park in 2020\nalso recorded some positive impacts on the economy. It was observed that such\neconomic activities spilled over into related industries such as agriculture and\nhandicraft, whereby these farmers and artisans benefited from increased demand for\ntheir products by visitors and tourism employees (Kiwango et al., 2022; Namara &", "word_count": 275, "start_char": 30798, "end_char": 32722}

For example, researchers have established that tourism in\nthe park significantly determines the national GDP, as noted by Mugizi et al. (2017)\nand Kiwango et al. (2022). In 2020, tourism in this park brought in over $15 million, a\nbig percentage share in this country's tourism earnings for that year (UBOS, 2021).\nOther than GDP, foreign exchange generated through tourism in Lake Mburo National\nPark has been vital to the Ugandan economy.

Considerable\ninterest has been placed in infrastructure development to complement the tourism\nservices in the park. These were in the form of investments in road networks,\nutilities, and amenities that characterize tourism facilities as ways towards improving\nvisitor accessibility and experiences. This is according to Namara & Uwimbabazi\n(2021) and MTWA (2019).\nThe government has also complemented infrastructure development with policies to\nensure the involvement of the private sector in the tourism industry within the park.\nMany incentives-cum-opportunities, including tax breaks, land allocations, and\nsimplified regulatory processes, have attracted local and international investors to\ndevelop hotels, restaurants, and activity providers in the area (Guma, 2018; NPA,\n2020). This has led to an increase in the diversification of tourism products and\nservices at Lake Mburo, thereby enriching the economic contribution of this sector.\nAs a way of ensuring that benefits from tourism accrue equitably, community-based\ntourism has been initiated by the Ugandan government within Lake Mburo National\nPark.

Besides, the chapter\nintends to outline the techniques to be used to implement the research and provide\nan insight into the quality of all means to be used throughout the process.\n3.1 Research Design\nThe proposed study will adopt a cross-section research design approach. In this\nregard, the study will adopt both quantitative and qualitative research approaches.\nQuantitative research approach, in this case, will be employed in the analysis of\nstatistical data. The researcher will adopt a qualitative approach to ensure the\noutcome is unbiased and generalizable to a wider population. Qualitative research\napproach is mainly exploratory research used to gain an understanding of underlying\nreasons, opinions, and motivations and provide insight into the problem or help to\ndevelop ideas or hypothesis for potential quantitative research (Mugenda and\nMugenda, 2020). The qualitative research approach applies when non-numerical data\nis to be collected.\n3.2 Population of the Study\nThe target population in this research on the economic impact of tourism at Lake\nMburo National Park would be a representation of the following key stakeholders:\nvisitors and tourists who visit the park, both domestic and international; members\n\nfrom the local community residing in areas around the park who are affected by the\ntourism industry; and tourism operators and businesses such as tour providers, lodges,\nand restaurants dealing with visitors, government officials, and policy makers from\nagencies in charge of the park's management and development like MTWA and UWA,\nand staff and management of the park itself. The targeting of such a population mix\nby the researcher will provide an in-depth overview of how tourism to Lake Mburo\nNational Park results in economic benefits, opportunities, challenges, and/or any\nnegative unplanned impacts that may be associated with the tourism for the\ndevelopment of evidence-based policies and strategies aimed at maximizing the full\ntourism potential of the park.\n3.3 Sample size and selection\n3.3.1 Sample Size\nThe sample size can be defined as the total number of sub-elements or individuals\nselected and assigned randomly from a given population.\nFor this reason, the population of the study will be 80 respondents (Krejcie and\nMorgan’ sample size table 1970).", "word_count": 439, "start_char": 39366, "end_char": 42280}

In each of these groups, the sample shall\nbe further stratified to capture relevant sub-groups that would possibly help the\nresearcher elicit diverse perspectives. Furthermore, the researcher will use purposive\nsampling in which key informants are deliberately sampled with a view to eliciting indepth insights into the issues being studied. In this manner, the combination of such\nmethods will enable the researcher to make a sample representative of the universe\nin general, yet representative of specialized information in this regard. This would\nserve to enhance the reliability and validity of the findings.\n3.4 Sources of Data\nPrimary sources: Primary data shall help the researcher have fresh and unused data\nfor the determination of events. Through data collection instruments such as\ninterviews and questionnaires, the researcher will reach the respondents directly. This\nwill enable the researcher to gather primary information on what transpired.\nSecondary sources: Review of documents relating to the study, newspapers, online\njournals, and textbooks will be used such that the researcher is well equipped with\nthe required data to facilitate the study.\n3.5 Data Collection Methods and Instruments", "word_count": 276, "start_char": 42168, "end_char": 44088}

The researcher shall adopt primary and secondary\nsources of data collection in the study.\n3.6 Questionnaire\nA questionnaire, according to Kumar, 2005 is a written list of questions; the answers\nto which are recorded by the respondents. The questionnaire contains sets of\nquestions that are to be answered by filling, after which they are picked back for data\nanalysis. In this study, self-administered questionnaires covering the aspects of the\nstudy variables and accompanied by a five-point Likert scale response continuum, that\nis 5= strongly agree, 4=agree, 3=undecided, 2=disagree and 1= strongly disagree, was\nused to collect data responses. The above method of collecting data will be\npreferred, as it gives a great degree of assurance to anonymity and confidence of the\nresearch respondents.\n3.6 Quality Control\n3.6.1 Validity\nCollis &Hussey, (2013), holds that the validity of an instrument is the ability of the\ninstrument to collect justifiable and truthful data; that is, measuring what it is\ndeveloped to measure. Development shall be based on the objectives of the study.\nThe instruments for data collection shall then be presented to the supervisor who\nshall attest to the content validity of the instrument.

Testing for validity, the study will adopt\ncontent as related validity through consultations with the researcher's supervisor and\npeers. Then, the researcher prepares the questionnaires and presents them to the\nsupervisor for scrutiny and suggestions on the relevance, clarity, and suitability of\ninformation. The supervisor then will make suggestions that will be incorporated into\nthe final draft. Reliability of the research instrument refers to the measure of the\ndegree to which the research instrument yields consistent result data or data after\nrepeated trials. To establish the reliability of the research instruments, the researcher\nwill administer questionnaires and pilot test them using various respondents after\nwhich the researcher will make necessary changes for the questionnaires to give\nrelevant data.\n3.7 Ethical Issues.\nA copy of the introductory letter from the University by the school of business will be\npresented to ensure that the information obtained from research is for academic\npurposes. The researcher will make sure participation will be on a voluntary basis,\nand therefore, cannot force them. The researcher will also brief the respondents\nbefore the data is collected from them. The researcher will cite all the necessary\ndocuments used in this work to recognize their effort in as far as secondary data is\nconcerned.\n\n3.8 Limitations of the Study\nSample and selection: Any sampling errors may appear while selecting a sample\nbecause the sample does not reflect the general population or appropriate population\nconcerned through using a probability sampling method.\nInsufficient sample size for the measurement: In every study, an appropriate sample\nsize is required to draw a valid research conclusion. The sample size may be too\nsmall; it will be difficult to establish significant relations from the data. Since most\nstatistical tests have a minimum number of sample size to ensure that the sample is\nrepresentative of a population and the statistical result can be generalized in the\nlarger population.", "word_count": 383, "start_char": 45425, "end_char": 47912}

The topic of\nstudy was THE IMPACT OF TOURISM ON UGANDA'S ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT: A CASE\nSTUDY OF LAKE MBURO NATIONAL PARK IN WESTERN UGAND. The following statistical\nfindings are from data collected by the use of questionnaires and interview guides.\nData collection occurred from a total of 80 respondents whereby they filled\nquestionnaires. Presentation of findings was then done in line with the objectives of\nthe study whereby the raw data in the form of questionnaires was edited and\ninterpreted, which ensured uniformity, legibility, and consistency. Then, data-filled\nquestionnaires were copied and analyzed by tallying and tabling in frequency polygons\nwhile identifying how often certain responses occurred and later an evaluation was\ndone. The information was then recorded in terms of percentages.\nThe direct economic benefits generated through tourism activities in Lake Mburo\nNational Park include revenue from park entry fees, accommodation, sales of food\nand beverages, and other services related to tourism activities.\nStatistics in table 4.5 below summarize the findings on this objective.\nResponses where in form of ticking against statements in regards to the respondent's\ndegree of acceptance.\n\nTable 4.5 The direct economic benefits accruing to the development of tourism\nactivities on Lake Mburo National Park, inclusive of revenue accrued from park entry\nfees, accommodation, food and beverage sales, and other tourism-related services.\nTable 4.5: The Direct Economic Benefits Generated by Tourism Activities at Lake\nMburo National Park\nSA (n) (%) A (n) (%)\nNS\n(n)\n(%)\nD (n) (%)\nSD\n(n)\n(%)\nDoes the park generate significant\nrevenue from park entry fees paid\nby visitors?\n20 (25%)\n5 (6.25%)\nDo accommodation providers\nwithin or near the park (e.g.,\nlodges, campsites) earn\nsubstantial income from tourists\nstaying overnight?\n20 (25%)\nDo food and beverage\nestablishments (e.g., restaurants,\ncafes) in the park or surrounding\nareas earn substantial revenue\n0 (0%)\n(18.75%)\n\nSA (n) (%) A (n) (%)\nNS\n(n)\n(%)\nD (n) (%)\nSD\n(n)\n(%)\nfrom tourists?\nDo other tourism-related services\nand businesses (e.g., tour\noperators, transport providers,\ncraft vendors) earn significant\nincome from visitors to the park?\nDoes\nthe\noverall\neconomic\nactivity generated by tourism at\nLake Mburo National Park provide\nsubstantial direct benefits to the\nlocal and regional economy?\n0 (0%)\n(18.75%)", "word_count": 440, "start_char": 47610, "end_char": 50463}
