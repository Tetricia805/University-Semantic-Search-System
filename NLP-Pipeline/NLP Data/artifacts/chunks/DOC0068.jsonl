Pharmacies in Uganda are\ncentral points of access for medicines and medicines but are faced with significant\noperation issues (Mugisha et al., 2023). Current systems rely primarily on manual or\nsemi-computerized operations, which lead to:\nIneffective stock management (Nabukenya et al., 2022)\nFrequent stockout of medicines (Katende & Nakitende, 2023)\nInadequate tracking of prescriptions (Ssengooba et al., 2022)\nDelayed service delivery (Tumwesigye et al., 2023)\n\nPatients experience a number of challenges including:\nLong distances traveled to access out-of-stock medicines (Bagonza et al., 2023),\nLack of price transparency (Uganda National Drug Authority, 2022),\nNo electronic management of prescriptions (Ministry of Health, 2023),\nUganda's digital landscape provides an opportunity for transformation:\n85% mobile phone penetration (UCC, 2023),\nInternet access rising from 35% (2022) to estimated 50% (2024) (NITA, 2023).\n\nThe proposed FLOW+ (Fast Local Online Web+ ) platform addresses these\nchallenges through:\nDigital inventory management\nOnline prescription management\nReal-time drug availability\nAutomated patient reminders\n\n1.2 Problem Statement\nThis project emerged because researchers conducted multiple investigations about\npharmacy challenges as well as patient problems throughout Uganda. Multiple\nmethods involving stakeholder interviews and academic research alongside field\nstudies\nconfirmed\nongoing\nhealthcare\naccessibility\nissues\ncoupled\nwith\npharmaceutical inefficiencies. Pharmacies documented severe inventory management\nproblems because regular stockout incidents occurred in 42% of cases and 28% of\nmedications became unsuable before they could be used (Katende & Nakitende 2023,\nNabukenya et al. 2022). Such findings showed that the healthcare industry needed to\nimplement smarter inventory tracking technology.\n\nMedical patients revealed important deficiencies in their access to medicine together\nwith prescription management practices. Medical clinic patients endure extended wait\nperiods that last more than 45 minutes per appointment (Tumwesigye et al., 2023)\nsince individual patient records remain decentralized and cause challenges for\nmanaging treatments of chronic diseases. The manual medication prescription process\nresults in 18% of prescriptions containing errors, which threatens patient protection\naccording to Mugisha et al. (2023). People in rural areas fall short in obtaining\nessential treatments because they face difficulties finding medications, together with\nunclear medicine prices in local pharmacies.\n\nThe research established that Uganda's ineffective pharmaceutical service delivery\nstems from its insufficient digitalization and a lack of centralized systems and\nreal-time information exchange. The development of FLOW+ emerged as a complete\nsystem to resolve these operational shortcomings through customized web technology\nplatforms made for patient and pharmacy needs.", "word_count": 424, "start_char": 9349, "end_char": 13508}

The pharmacy side employs voice-based automation for faster\ndispensing operations while leveraging the analytical dashboard for improved\nbusiness selection and growth strategies.\n1.4 Project Scope\nThe FLOW+ project includes distinct functionalities that work synergistically to\nimprove healthcare services by serving patients and delivering pharmacy benefits.\nThe application implements data protection standards at a global level, including ISO\n27001, which ensures all users enjoy secure access to the system. Users gain access to\nsearch medications with price information coupled to real-time availability, while they\ncan manage their prescriptions through one centralized interface. Automation features\nin the system guarantee that prescription refills arrive on time, which boosts patient\ntreatment compliance.\n\nThrough the system, the pharmacy receives integrated inventory control, which\npredicts expiring stock together with automated prescription handling that minimizes\nhuman mistakes and generates standardized sales reports. The implementation of\nvoice-assisted features allows pharmacy workers to interact with the system better,\nwhich decreases mistakes while improving operational speed. The system begins its\nimplementation as a nationwide network, although add-ons and adaptations can be\n\nmade to suit the specific needs of individual healthcare institutions according to their\nexisting systems.\n1.5 System Overview\nFLOW+ works as a two-sided web system to connect patients with pharmacies\nthrough its digital services in Uganda. The system delivers substantial benefits to its\nend users due to its design emphasis of user convenience and productivity. The system\nsaves patients substantial time researching medications by 65% per initial testing\n(Bagonza et al., 2023) and provides patients 24/7 access to view their medications.\nUsers benefit from transparent features through the platform because it shows\nmedication cost and availability among multiple pharmacy networks.", "word_count": 416, "start_char": 13136, "end_char": 16232}

Research Methodology\nCreating FLOW+ required marrying practitioner wisdom with technical nuance. We\nstarted by listening talking to pharmacists about their working issues and to patients\nabout feeling let down by medicine availability. This was added to a thorough\nexamination of existing research, which set out a system based on real needs rather\nthan conjecture.\n2. Gathering Insights\nWe did not learn just from textbooks. Teams visited pharmacies like Kabana\nPharmacy and observed how the pharmacy workers maintained pen-and-paper\nprescriptions and manual stock records. And from interviews with pharmacists, some\ncommon themes persisted: about half reported chronic stockouts, and patients were\ncomplaining about delays and disorienting prices. These were consistent with national\npatterns, like the 2022 Uganda National Drug Authority report on breaks in the supply\nchain.\n3. Building the System\nFLOW+ was developed incrementally, puzzle piece by puzzle piece. Figma sketches,\nearly on, grew into an operational prototype, with frontend support coming from\nReact.js and backend Node.js. MongoDB's flexibility allowed us to grow as we\nprogressed, like the addition of voice-search capabilities after pharmacists complained\nof typing lag during peak periods. Testing wasn't an afterthought either; students and\npharmacy staff tested each feature, flagging problems (like confusing prescription\nuploads) that we worked out in real-time.\n4. Measuring Success\nDid it work? We measured numbers and anecdotes. Stockout rates declined by 30% in\ntest pharmacies, and patients reported reduced time spent searching for medicines.\nBut most telling were the small wins: a pharmacist applauding the expiry-date\nreminders, or a patient smiling happily refilling a prescription in one click.\n5. Challenges and Ethics\nNo project is perfect. Rural internet outages limited testing, and cost left SMS\nreminders something high up our wishlist on the back burner. Ethics did come first,\nthough, with patient information being encrypted and survey answers anonymized, so\nthat trust wasn't sacrificed for the sake of speed.\n\n6. Why This Matters\nMethodology wasn't a process, but rather keeping feet on the ground in Uganda's\nreality.
