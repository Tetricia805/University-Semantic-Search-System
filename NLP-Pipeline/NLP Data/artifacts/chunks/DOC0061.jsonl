It is the standard style used in research\npapers, theses, dissertations, technical reports, and journal\narticles.\n\n❑Scientific Writing (Formal Style):\n❑This experiment investigated the effect of sunlight on plant growth. Two identical\nplants were placed under different conditions: one exposed to direct sunlight and the\nother kept in a shaded environment. After seven days, the plant in sunlight exhibited\ngreater height and healthier appearance compared to the shaded plant. These results\nsuggest that sunlight promotes faster and healthier plant growth.\nNormal Writing (Casual Style)\nVS\nScientific Writing (Formal Style)\n❑Normal Writing (Casual Style):\n❑I wanted to see if plants grow better in sunlight or in the shade. So, I put\none plant on the window where the sun hits directly and another plant in\nthe corner of the room. After a week, the one in the sun grew taller and\nlooked healthier, while the shaded one was weaker.", "word_count": 447, "start_char": 0, "end_char": 3221}
