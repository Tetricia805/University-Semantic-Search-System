The quantitative method was\nused to collect numerical data in form of numbers representing particular facts or\nmeasurement which helped the researcher to obtain information from respondents in\ndepth. While the qualitative method explored a wide array of dimensions like the\ntexture and leave of everyday life, the understanding and experiences of the research\nparticipants and the significance of the meaning they generate.\nAfter conducting the study, findings revealed that service quality and customer\nretention both go hand in hand and this meant that Stanbic bank should improve on\ntheir service quality and implement more efficient management systems because the\nhigher the service quality the higher the customer retention in the bank. And from\nthe findings of the study and the conclusions drawn, the researcher came up with\nrecommendations to ensure that management of service quality is emphasized and\nthese as included; more training of workers in order to improve their knowledge about\nwork and service delivery 1; Good customer care to maintain and expand the market\nreach; Physical facility extensions in order to create space for offering quality\nservices to customers with no congestion among others.", "word_count": 273, "start_char": 9835, "end_char": 11623}

In the changing\neconomy, Service quality as a critical measure of organizational performance\ncontinues to compel the attention of banking institution and remains at the fore front\nof service marketing literature and practice (Lasser 2000). According to Zethiaml &\nBitner (2003),”service quality is a focused evaluation that reflects the customer’s\nperception of specific dimensions of service which are reliability, responsiveness,\nassurance, empathy, tangibles, and satisfaction on the other hand is more inclusive\nand influenced by perceptions of product quality and price as well as situational and\npersonal factors. According to Dahaner (1997), the interest is largely driven by the\nrealization that higher service quality results into customer’s satisfaction and loyalty,\ngreater willingness to recommend someone else, reduction in complaints and\nimproved customer retention rates. Undoubtedly owing to the belief that delivery of\nhigh service quality is a must for attaining customer satisfaction and the number of\nother desirable behavior out comes today, banks that offer good service quality\ncreate good client relationship In order to create it the organization strives to offer\nthe best it can to its clients and which translates in high customer retention because\nof the exception care and concern the organization will have for its clients.(Cronin, &\nTaylor (1992)).

It is the instrument which is predominantly used to\nmeasure customers’ perception of service quality. The model is most acknowledged\nand applied in a variety of industries. Originally, the model provided a list of ten\ndeterminants of service quality: access, communication, competence, courtesy,\ncredibility, reliability, responsiveness, security, understanding and tangibles. Later\nreviews merged correlated variables and reduced the determinants to five\nconsolidated dimensions, namely tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, assurance and\nempathy as the instruments for measuring service quality (Parasuraman et a!., 1988;\nZeithaml et al., 1990). The simplified model is simple and has been useful for\nquantitatively assessing customers experience in service.\n2.2 Customer Retention Explained\nCustomer retention refers to the ability of a company to retain its existing customers\nand encourage repeat purchases or continued engagement over an extended period of\ntime.

This entails that any company interested in retaining customers\nmust focus on customers\nCustomer retention as a concept draws strength from relationship marketing and 1s a\nseparation from customer attraction, which is inclined towards transactional\nmarketing. Customer retention is the act of keeping customers resulting from service\nquality and customer satisfaction (Ross 1995\nKottler (2000) argues that customer retention is an important phenomenon because it\nhas a bearing on costs and profitability over time. Sasser (1990) also supports this\nargument. Comparatively, customer acquisition requires substantial skills in lead\ngeneration, lead qualification, and account conversion. Consequently, it is not enough\nto attract new customers; the company must keep them. As a result he recommends\nfour steps to reducing the defection rate (the rate at which the company loses\ncustomers):\n• The company must define and measure its retention rate.\n• The company must distinguish the causes of customer attrition and identify those\nthat can be managed better.\n• The company needs to estimate how much profit it loses when it loses customers.\n• The company needs to figure out how much it would cost to reduce the defection\nrate.\n2.3 Service\nKotler (2000) defines a service as any activity or benefit that one party can offer to\nanother that is essentially intangible and doesn’t result in the ownership of anything.\nPayne (1998) asserts that production may or may not be tied to physical product.\nService\nis\ncharacterized\nby\nintangibility,\nheterogeneity\ninseparability\nand\nperishability.

In other\nwords, a service must be able to maintain the long term clients of the bank.\nAccording to Lexington (1990) service refers to the activity or a series of activities of\nmore or less intangible nature that normally but not necessarily take place in\ninteractions between customer and service employees and! or physical resources and!\nor systems of the service provider which are provided as solutions to customer\nproblems\n2.4 Quality\nMahuda (2006) asserts that quality is the degree to which a product or service\nsatisfies a customer’s requirements or expectations, Marcourse (2003) defines quality\nas satisfying customer expectation. This is in line with what Kotler (2000) asserted\nthat quality is “freedom from defects” and that it begins with customer needs and\nends with customer satisfaction. According to Balunywa, (1995) quality means\nattributes of a product or a service.\nQuality can be graded in terms of good and poor quality. However according to the\nresearch done the services provided by commercial banks have to be of good quality\nto retain its loyal clients. 1-lorward (2005) defines quality as a predictability degree\nof uniformity and dependability at low cost and suited to the market. To the\nresearcher’s understanding quality is an expectation of customers on what\ncommercial banks should offer in terms of excellence and superiority.\n2.6 Service quality\nAccording to Kotler (2014), service quality means understanding customer’s needs\nand identifying ways to meet and exceed them. It is orientation of all resources and\nall people in the organization towards customer satisfaction.

He highlights the nature of quality of\nassessment and influences the corporate image of banks in comparison with its\ncompetitors.\nMarsh (1980) emphasizes the fact that service quality is the platform of which retail\nbanking builds its business thus politeness, professionalism, efficiency, general\nattitudes and even the way the staff is dressed, play a role in convincing the public\nthat the bank provides quality service. In other words in the researcher’s view\nattracting new customers and retaining the old ones.\n2.6 What are the factors that influence service quality in commercial banks.\nDifferent factors or dimensions of service quality were identified by Valerie.&\nZeithrnal (1998) studying various service categories such as retail banking, long\ndistance telephone services, security brokerages and credit card institutions. These\nfactors are explained below;\n2.6.1 Reliability\nThe reliability and consistency of performance of service facilities, goods and staff is\nseen as important (Johnston, 1997). This includes punctual customer. According to\nFitzsimmons and Fitzsimrnons (2001), reliability accurately with error free.\n2.6.2 Responsiveness\nJohnston (1997) describes responsiveness as the speed and timeliness of service\ndelivery. This includes the speed of through put and the ability of the waiting and\nqueuing time; Fitzsimrnons and Fitzsimrnons (2001) argue that when the customer is\nkept waiting for no apparent reason creates unnecessary negative perception of\nquality. Conversely, the ability for the bank of recover quickly when service fails and\nexhibit professionalism will also create very positive perception of quality.", "word_count": 306, "start_char": 21577, "end_char": 23692}

(2001), empathy is the provision caring, individualized\nattention to customers. Fitzsimmons and Fitzsimmons (2001) posit that empathy\nincludes approach ability, sensitivity, and effort to understand the customer’s needs.\nJohnston 1997 describes empathy as the ability to make the customer feel welcome,\nparticularly by the contact staff.\n2.6.4 Tangibles\nThe tangibles encompass the appearance of the company representatives, facilities,\nmaterials, and equipment as well as communication materials. The condition of the\nphysical surroundings is seen as tangible evidence of care and attention to detail\nexhibited by the service provider (Fitzsimrnons and Fitzsimmons, 2001). Davis et a!\n(2003) summarizes tangible as the physical evidence of the service\n2.7 Literature Summary\nThis part of the study summarizes the information as researched by the past scholars\nby way of definitions. Service is defined as an intangible and tangible activity or\nbenefit that one party can offer to another that essentially may not result in the\nownership of anything however creating want or satisfaction. On the other hand\nquality is the degree of satisfaction of customers’ requirements or expectations.\n\nCHAPTER THREE\nMETHODOLOGY\n3.0 Introduction\nThis chapter focuses on the methodology. It shows the whole process followed when\nprocessing and analyzing data. This includes research design, study population,\nsample size, data collection methods and instrument, procedures of data collection,\ndata sources, validity and reliability of research tools, data processing and analysis,\nlimitations of the study.\n3.1 Research Design\nThe researcher used a descriptive cross sectional survey design. A cross sectional\nsurvey deals with one part of the population at a time. It included both qualitative\nand quantitative methodology of data collection (Maicibi 2000).\nQuantitative method was used to collect numerical data in form of numbers\nrepresenting particular facts or measurement Wangusa (2007) which helped the\nresearcher to obtain information from respondents in depth.\nMason (2002) indicated that qualitative research, the researcher is able to explore a\nwide array of dimensions like the texture and leave of everyday life, the\nunderstanding and experiences of the research participants and the significance of\nthe meaning they generate.\n3.2 Study Population\nThe target population was from four departments namely; accounting department,\nhuman resource management department, finance department and marketing\ndepartment, the researcher used purposive sampling method", "word_count": 396, "start_char": 23537, "end_char": 26288}

The researcher applied an\ninterview guide as an instrument to collect information from people involving person\nto person interactions. This enabled the researcher to obtain immediate response\nwhich eased the researcher study process.\n3.5 Procedures of data collection\nA pilot study was carried out in Stanbic Bank, Mukono branch to test validity and\nreliability of the data collection instrument.\n3.6 Data collection\nThe researcher used both primary and secondary sources of data.\n3.6.1 Primary Data\nPrimary data refers to data observed or collected from first-hand experience, original\ndata collected at the source and compiled for the purposes of this study. This was\ncollected from self-administered questionnaire.\n\n3.6.2 Secondary data\nThis is data that is extracted from existing literature for example the bank\npublications, journals, text books from the Hamu Mukasa Library.\n3.7 Validity\nTo ensure the validity of the instrument (questionnaire), the research supervisor\nhelped as an expert to assess the validity of the research instrument.\n3.8 Data processing and Analysis\nData processing and analysis was guided by the objectives of the study and research\nquestions. The collected data was arranged and categorized accordingly. The\nresearcher edited and coded the data for accuracy and completeness of information\nobtained and responses were summarized using frequencies, percentages and\npresented in tables. Data from interviews was later interpreted and discussed\nalongside with that from the questionnaires. Conclusions and recommendations were\nmade in relation to the study on the effect of service quality on customer retention in\ncommercial banks.\n3.9 Limitations of the Study.\nThe researcher anticipated to meet the following challenges in the course of the\nstudy\n• Shortage of funds limited the researcher since the study conducted was selfsponsored.\n• Time the researcher faced time constraints according to the time given to\ncollect and compile data to finish the research while attending classes", "word_count": 411, "start_char": 26288, "end_char": 29041}

The findings serve to\nreference the existing knowledge proven about the extent to which service quality\naffected customer retention in commercial banks.\nThe chapter involves analysis, interpretation and presentation of the data. Data is\nanalyzed, presented and discussed according to the research objectives and questions\nformulated in chapter one. Data was collected and analyzed in the form of tables\nbasing on the responses got from respondents.\n4.1 Nature of Respondents\nThis section highlights the nature of the respondent’s bio data which includes gender,\nAge, length of the period they stayed in the bank, the data on the respondent’s\ndemographics as presented in the subsections below;\n4.1.1 Period spent with Bank\nThe study investigated the length of period in years served by the respondents in the\norganization and the findings are presented in the table 4.1.1.\nTable 4.1.1. Period spent with Bank\nTime\nLess than 1 year\n2.5\n1-2 years\n2-4 years\nAbove 4 years\n62.5\nTotal\n\nThe table 4.1.1 shows that 2.5% of employees of Stanbic bank have stayed in the\nOrganization for less than l year, both respondents of 1-2 and 2-4years who have\nstayed in Stanbic Bank have taken 10% and 25% respectively, finally 62.5% have stayed\nfor more than 4 years. This implies that the biggest percentage of the respondents\nhad worked with the bank for a recognizable period of time thus being knowledgeable\nenough to provide valid responses on the quality of service provided by the bank.\n4.1.2 Age of Respondents\nThe study obtained details about the age groups of the respondents for purposes of\nunderstanding their age and possibly the experience they have in their respective\npositions. Details of the findings are shown in the table 4.1.2 below;\nTable 4.1.2: Age of Respondents.\nAge\nMale\nFemale\n20-29\n30-39\n17.5\n40-49\n7.5\nTotal\n\nTable 4.1.2 shows that the majority respondents are between the ages brackets of 20-\n29 and 30- 39 in the orders of 75%, 17.5% and 40-49 took 7.5%, none were above 50.\nThis can be concluded that the majority of the respondents are in the productive age\nbrackets of their life and are reasonably experienced.\n4.2 Management of Service Quality.\nAccording to the findings, most of the respondents strongly agreed that commercial\nbanks manage service quality as presented in the table 3 below;", "word_count": 449, "start_char": 28720, "end_char": 31476}
