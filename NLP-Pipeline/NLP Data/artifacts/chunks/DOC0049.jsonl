Polynomial functions are continuous at all points on the real axis R\n2. Rational functions are Continuous on the entire axis R except at the poles.\nNote 3.1.2\nIf one of the conditions above fails, then the function is not continuous at\nthat point.\n\nExample 3.1.1 Show that the polynomial function f(x) = x2 + 2x + 1 is continuous at\nx = 2\nSince\n(a) limx→2(x2 + 2x + 1) = 22 + 2(2) + 1 = 9 i.e exists\n(b) f(2) = 22 + 2(2) + 1 = 9 i.e exists\n(c) limx→2 f(x) = f(2) = 9\nHence f(x) = x2 + 2x + 1 is continuous at x = 2. In fact being a polynomial function, it\nis continuous at all points on R\nExample 3.1.2\nShow that the rational function,\nf(x)\n=\nx + 2\nx −1\nSince x = 3 is not a pole of the rational function for all substitution of 3 in the function,\nthe denominator does not go to zero.
