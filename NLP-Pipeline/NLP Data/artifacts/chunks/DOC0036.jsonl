In geotechnical and construction applications, these soils\npresent considerable challenges. Many stabilization techniques use energy-intensive\nsubstances like lime and cement, which present problems for the environment and\nthe economy. This research investigate the feasibility of using cement kiln dust (CKD),\nan industrial by-product produced during the cement manufacturing process, as a\nsustainable alternative for stabilizing sandy soils. Because CKD is high in calcium oxide\nand silica, it has potential pozzolanic properties that may improve soil cohesiveness\nand mechanical performance while resolving disposal-related waste management\nissues. This study assesses the geotechnical characteristics of CKD-stabilized sandy\nsoils through laboratory tests, including the Proctor test, Unconfined Compressive\nStrength (UCS), California Bearing Ratio test, and permeability test. To find the ideal\npercentage for maximizing strength and durability, various percentages of cement kiln\ndust, ranging from 5% to 20%, were combined with sandy soil samples. After a 7-day\ncuring period, the results showed a 45% improvement in UCS and a 58.5%\nimprovement in CBR values, indicating that the optimum percentage of cement kiln\ndust to be added was 15%. Furthermore, the permeability significantly dropped by\n93%, indicating improved soil. According to the MoWT general specifications for Road\nand Bridge Works 2005, the soil's PI, CBR swell and linear shrinkage were all\ndetermined to be within allowable limits.\n\nii\n\nDECLARATION\nI declare that this research proposal is the result of my own efforts, free of\nplagiarism, and has never been presented to any other institution for any academic\nresearch except at this University.\nStudent name: BAMANISA KABAGAMBE Rachel\nRegistration number: S21B32/032\nSignature:....................................\nDate:..................................\n\niii\n\nAPPROVAL\nThis research report by BAMANISA KABAGAMBE Rachel has been under my supervision\nand submitted to the Department of Engineering, Design and Technology as partial\nfulfillment for award of Bachelor of Science in Civil and Environmental Engineering.\nAcademic Supervisor: Mr. ZZIGWA MARVIN\nSIGNATURE.............................................

The roads play an essential role in the growth of trade locally as\nwell as with surrounding areas, and to facilitate the expansion of the public as well as\nbusiness sectors (Foster & Ranganathan, 2021). But the state of roads, especially in\nEast Africa, that can be attributed to a deficiency of proper geotechnical investigation\nand the use of subquality materials during construction usually renders such\ninfrastructure ineffective.\nThe condition of subgrade essentially influences the performance of pavements on\nroads. To keep the pavement system maintained and guaranteed to have a long life, a\nproperly designed subgrade is required (Khodary et al., 2020). Therefore, one must\nevaluate the engineering properties of the soil, including its bearing capacity, before\nconstruction to see if it is appropriate for use to support structural loads.\nIn construction, cohesiveless soils, such as sandy soils, pose significant challenges.\nThese soils are of low bearing capacity and shear strength due to their poor grading\nand non-plasticity. They are prone to fines migration, which could lead to stability\nproblems. Differential settlement under loading will be more probable in sandy soils\ndue to their inherent heterogeneity in strength and compressibility. Though the\nreplacement of such soils with imported materials is one way of improving\ngeotechnical conditions, it is usually expensive and time-consuming (Mohamed et al.,\n2023).", "word_count": 348, "start_char": 11959, "end_char": 14487}

We talk about\nweathering when there is break down of rocks into smaller particles that can be taken\nby water or wind. When these particles accumulate with time, they lead to the\nformation of sandy soils(Vakili et al., 2023).\nSandy soil is classified by its sand particles quantity, generally made of more than 75%\nsand, while the remaining composition is made of a blending of silt and clay.\nThis specific soil type causes challenges for construction industries because of its low\nhigh drainage, low water absorption, low bearing capacity, high settlement potential,\nand increased vulnerability to erosion. Consequently, this results in a naturally\nunstable ecosystem. This make this soil type not suitable for construction work(S.\nWang et al., 2023).\nStabilizing sandy soils might be the better way to increase its bearing capacity.\nDifferent stabilizers and methods have been used to modify the physical\ncharacteristics of these types of soils and make them more practical for construction\npurposes(S. Wang et al., 2023).\nThe main objective of stabilizing sandy soil is to improve its performance in the\nconstruction industry by increasing its bearing capacity and decrease its permeability,\nincrease its cohesion properties and decrease its excessive settlement when subjected\nto a load. There are many techniques of stabilizing sandy soil mechanically and\nchemically and one of them the use of cement kiln dust as stabilizer (Abdila et al.,\n2022).", "word_count": 296, "start_char": 14091, "end_char": 16008}

It is estimated that CKD constitutes approximately 15–20% of the\ntotal cement output, resulting in the generation of hundreds of millions of metric tons\nin alignment with the annual global cement production figures. However, not all\ncomponents of CKD are suitable for recycling within the cement manufacturing\nprocess due to their elevated levels of alkalis, sulphate, and chloride, which can lead\nto excessive concentrations in the final product (Kunal et al., 2012). Research findings\nindicate that CKD possesses both physical and chemical characteristics that render it\nuseful in various applications, including soil stabilization, concrete mixtures, chemical\ntreatment, and the production of ceramics and bricks, as well as mine backfill(Al-\nBakri et al., 2022).\n1.2 PROBLEM STATEMENT\nSandy soils, distinguished by their coarse particle sizes, minimal cohesion, and high\npermeability, frequently present considerable difficulties in construction and\nengineering endeavors. The soils are susceptible to instability, resulting in issues like\nexcessive settlement, erosion, and diminished load-bearing capacity. Because of their\nlow natural stability, roads built on sandy soils are prone to surface erosion and\nultimate failure, particularly in areas with significant rainfall(S. Wang et al., 2023).\nPaicho Road, a 23.7km road located in Gulu District, faces many difficulties,\nespecially during the rainy season, because of the presence of ferruginous and sandy\nsoils, which have a low bearing capacity and a high susceptibility to erosion.

To determine engineering properties of neat sandy soil.\n2. To determine chemical properties of cement kiln dust.\n3. To determine the engineering properties of sandy soil stabilized with varying\npercentages of cement kiln dust and polypropylene fiber.\n1.3.2 RESEARCH QUESTIONS\n1. What are the engineering properties of the neat sandy soil to be stabilized?\n2. What are the chemical properties of cement kiln dust?\n3. What are the engineering properties of sandy soils when stabilized with\ndifferent percentages of cement kiln dust?\n1.4 JUSTIFICATION\nCement Kiln Dust (CKD) is a byproduct produced during the cement production\nprocess, characterised for its high levels of free lime (CaO), silica (SiO2), and alumina\n(Al2O3). When CKD is mixed with water, it generates calcium oxide (CaO) and\ndifferent alkalis, which then interact with moisture to form calcium hydroxide\n(Ca(OH)2). The subsequent rise in calcium ions in the pore water promotes pozzolanic\n\nreactions, where the silica and alumina present in CKD engage with calcium hydroxide\nand the sandy soil. This interaction results in the formation of Calcium Silicate\nHydrates (C-S-H), which are essential for binding soil particles, thus improving the\nshear strength and load-bearing capacity of the sandy soil.(Rimal et al., 2019). It is\nalso a cost-effective way to achieve high-strength soils and other construction\nmaterials by reducing the construction cost; it is environmentally friendly product and\nprovides excellent chemical resistance too many common solvents. This alteration\nsuccessfully decreases permeability, thus minimizing the risks linked to erosion and\nexcessive(Benziane et al., 2019).The use of CKD for stabilizing sandy soil also\npromotes environmental sustainability by reusing an industrial byproduct often\ndiscarded in landfills. This method provides a more economical substitute for\nconventional stabilizers like cement or lime.\n1.5 GEOGRAPHICAL SCOPE\nThis study is centered on sandy soils from Paicho road in Gulu District in Northern\nUganda as shown in Figure 1 map, with latitude 2.9000° N, and longitude 32.4500° E.\n\nFigure 1: showing the Paicho Road map", "word_count": 407, "start_char": 17658, "end_char": 20318}

The gaps among these\nparticles hold both water and air. Soils can exist in different conditions: dry, partially\nmoist, or completely saturated. In dry condition, the spaces are filled with air; in\nfully saturated state, they are filled with water; and in partially saturated state, the\nspaces hold a combination of air and water. The condition of soil differs considerably\nin various geographical regions. Soils that lack plasticity because they have no clay\nminerals are categorized as cohesive less soil(Anthony et al., 2023).\n2.1.2 Sandy soil\nSandy soil is described as frictional or cohesionless soil because its particles lack\nadhesion. These soils exhibit reduced shear strength and bearing capacity, have poor\nwater retention, display no plasticity, and show minimal or no shear strain among\nparticles. Traditional stabilization methods for sandy soil, such as utilizing fly ash,\nbitumen, and lime cement, generally require prolonged curing durations. As a result,\nthe use of polymers for stabilizing sandy soils has grown in popularity in modern\npractices, since they do not need extended curing periods and are chemically stable.\nThe application of polymers for soil improvement is not limited to sandy soils; it has\nalso been successfully utilized in clay soils to enhance several physical characteristics,\nincluding boosting shear strength and bearing capacity, decreasing settlement,\nminimizing swelling, and tackling problems related to weak soils(J.-P. Wang et al.,\n2020).", "word_count": 312, "start_char": 19990, "end_char": 22028}

The degree of this settlement is significantly affected by the\nstructural properties of the soil. In the scenario of dense sandy soils, the resulting\ndeformation is slight; however, as the sand's density reduces, the deformation\ntypically rises. If the density of saturated sand drops below a critical level under\ncertain stresses, the load will shift to the pore water and cause liquefaction, which\ncould lead to the collapse of the soil structure(Luat et al., 2020).\nIn saturated cohesionless soils or when water is added to the soil, vibrations can also\nresult in liquefaction. After the excess pore water pressure decreases, the soil\ndensifies( Soleimani et al., 2018).

This substance has a fine, powdery texture similar to Portland\ncement. CKD poses several challenges, such as possible health hazards, storage issues,\nand environmental contamination. The increasing demand for cement around the\nworld has resulted in a noticeable buildup of kiln dust at cement manufacturing\nfacilities. This fine dust is a major environmental hazard and is challenging to\neliminate. Research is being done all over the world to find economical ways to use\ncement kiln dust in a range of applications, including agriculture, pavement\nconstruction, soil stabilization, waste material stabilization, cement manufacturing,\nand the production of cement-based products(Ahmed et al., 2023).\n2.2.1. How is CKD generated?\nThe method entails burning raw materials in a rotary kiln to produce clinker. Around\n2.6 to 2.8 tons of raw materials are needed to produce one ton of cement. Between\n5% and 10% of these finely milled substances will become airborne and remain\nsuspended as dust within the gases. Usually, for each ton of clinker created, a typical\nkiln\nreleases\napproximately\n0.06\nto\n0.07\ntons\nof\ncement\nkiln\ndust(CKD)(Sreekrishnavilasam & Santagata, 2006).\n2.2.3. Environmental problem related to the use of CKD\nCKD has been observed to significantly impact both flora and fauna within the\necosystem. The recorded impacts include stunted development in plants and animals,\ndiminished chlorophyll levels in vegetation, obstructed stomata on leaves, changed\ncellular metabolism in both plants and animals, respiratory illnesses in animals, blood\n\nissues, various cancers, and vision problems, among additional concerns (Al-Bakri et\nal., 2022).\nMoreover, dust emissions primarily take place during different stages of the cement\nproduction process, including raw mills, the kiln system, the clinker cooler, and\ncement mills. Typically, these processes involve the passage of heated exhaust gases\nor air through crushed materials, resulting in a mixture of gas and particles (Mater,\n2019). The characteristics of the produced particulates are closely tied to the source\nsubstances, such as raw materials, clinker, or cement. These emissions present\nsignificant health hazards to humans and deteriorate the quality of the air. Acid\nprecipitation, climate change, ozone depletion, loss of biodiversity, and reduced\nagricultural output are a few examples of the local and global environmental effects\nof these emissions(Uliasz-Bocheńczyk & Deja, 2024).\n2.2.4.

Numerous laboratory tests were completed to look at changed\nin unconfined compressive strength in specimens where the soil tested was treated\nwith CKD to varying concentrations. Research was done on soils in both dry and\nsubmerged stage states (wet), and specimens were tested both with and without CKD.\nThe research found that the addition of CKD added considerable unconfined\ncompressive strength to the natural soil (El-aziz & Abo-hashema, 2018).\n\nAdditionally, researchers, in their research of the mechanistic action of CKD in clay,\nfound that CKD had properties similar to concrete, which was demonstrated by the\nformation of hydration products and the subsequent decrease in void space. As a\nresult, the plasticity index decreased and the strength increased over time. Using the\nASTM D4546 procedure, the swelling potential of the clay reduced significantly from\nabove 7% to 0.4% with 25% CKD. Likewise, the swell potential had decreased from\nabout 9.0% to 2.5% during a CBR test (Alaneme et al., 2022).\nOptical examination of voids in the CKD-stabilized clay samples indicated that void\nspace decreased as CKD concentration increased. When untreated, the clay soil had\nvoids of approximately 7% but the samples treated with 25% CKD had voids that\nranged from only 1% to 2.3% (Rimal et al., 2019). This reduction in empty spaces may\nexplain the strength increase that was observed. Interestingly, this reduction seems to\nbe more impacted by the level of CKD, or depth of treatment, than by the treatment\nduration or timing in relation to when it was placed. This reduction in voids may come\nfrom many valid interactions occurring simultaneously, such as the new products being\nformed from hydration and associated products filling the void spaces, and the CKD\nparticles reshaping the clay and stabilized mass. Further characterization of the\nvarious conditions of the clay samples treated with CKD is warranted (Ranjkesh\nAdarmanabadi et al., 2022).\n2.3.

The methods to stabilizing soil can be generally broken\ndown into two groups: mechanical stabilization and chemical stabilization. Mechanical\nstabilization methods include compaction and fibrous or other non-biodegradable\nreinforcements typically made of geomaterials to improve strength. Chemical\nstabilization improves the behaviors of clay soils using chemicals and emulsions as\nbinders and water repellents.\n2.3.1.

This process improves\nthe soil's stability and load-bearing ability by mechanically separating and blending\nthe natural soil with a stabilizing agent to form a homogenous mixture (Chatterjee et\nal., 2006). Furthermore, mechanical stabilization will increase the specified\nengineering properties by compacting the soil aggregate particles and producing a\ndense soil mass. To assist in the compaction process, finer aggregates or materials can\nbe introduced to create a uniform, well-graded, and dense soil-aggregate mixture.\nCareful consideration should be exercised when selecting construction techniques\nbased on the gradation of soil or soil-aggregate/materials. If it improves the\nengineering properties of the soil, geotextiles may be incorporated (Maalekian et al.,\n2007).\n\n2.3.2.

The plasticity index of\nthe soil serves as a critical factor in determining the appropriate stabilizer. For\nexample, when dealing with soil that has a plasticity index exceeding 10% and more\nthan 25% passing through a sieve of 200, lime is typically the preferred stabilizer\n(Haak & Indraratne, 2023). Conversely, for cohesive soils, cement may be utilized.\nAdditionally, the strength requirements post-stabilization will be influenced by the\nspecifications of the pavement.\n2.3.3. Lime as chemical stabilizer\nLime serves as a chemical stabilizer in soil treatment, with various types employed,\nincluding hydrated high calcium lime, monohydrated dolomite lime, calcite quick\nlime, and dolomite lime. Typically, the amount of lime utilized for soil stabilization\nranges from 5% to 10%. The process of lime modification enhances soil strength\nthrough cation exchange capacity(Pushpakumara & Mendis, 2022).\nLime stabilization can also involve a pozzolanic reaction, where pozzolanic materials\ninteract with lime in the presence of water, resulting in the formation of cementitious\ncompounds. This reaction can occur with either quick lime or hydrated lime\n(Ca(OH)2).", "word_count": 288, "start_char": 29274, "end_char": 31276}

However, the use of lime\nas a soil stabilizer has its constraints. As noted by Morse et al. (2007), there is a\nsignificant likelihood that the interaction between calcium ions and black humic acid\nproduced from lime leads to the formation of insoluble calcium hemic acid. The\nbreakdown of organic materials can impede the polymerization of silicates, thereby\nobstructing the formation of cementitious compounds.\nLime can effectively serve to permanently stabilize fine-grained soils for use as a\nsubgrade layer in pavement systems. The reaction between silica and alumina\nreleased from the soil and calcium from lime results in the creation of calcium silicate\nhydrates (CSH) and calcium aluminate hydrates (CAH), both of which are cementation\nproducts akin to those generated in Portland cement. This method strengthens layers\nof lime-stabilized soil to convert the sandy, granular soil into a rigid, relatively\nimpermeable layer that can support considerable weight (Malkanthi et al., 2020).\n2.3.4. Cement as a stabilizer\n\nWhen cement is mixed with water, hydration occurs, which produces excess calcium\nhydroxide (Ca (OH)2) and other cementing agents such as calcium silicate hydrates\n(CSH) and calcium aluminate hydrates (CAH). During the soil cement stabilization\nprocess, the bonding of soil particles provides substantial compressive strength. This\nprocess is initiated by the hydration of cement particles, which form interlocking\ncrystals. As the cement hydrates, soil-cement ultimately sets into a durable material.\nThe stabilization process reduces the soil void ratio as the cement fills the voids", "word_count": 325, "start_char": 30897, "end_char": 33115}

Introducing\nwater enables the cement to solidify making the soil heavier. Hardening cement also\nincreases the shear strength, and bearing capacity of the soil. Cement reduces the\nliquid limit making clay-rich soils easier to work with (Santos et al., 2020).\nNonetheless, there are drawbacks of using cement as a stabilizer. Heave and\ndisintegration may occur when an addition is a calcium-based additive, such as\ncement, when used with soils that contain sulfates, compromising the soil strength.\nSulfates may come from the natural composition of the soil or from groundwater\n(Radwan et al., 2021).\n2.3.5. Bituminous stabilization\nThe application of bituminous stabilization is defined as the precise incorporation of a\nspecified amount of bituminous material with existing soil or aggregate to develop a\nstable base or surface layer. In addition to increasing the cohesion stability of soil and\nload support capability of soil, bitumen increases its resistance to water intrusion.\nBituminous stabilization can be conducted with asphalt emulsions, asphalt cement, or\nasphalt cutback (Venkatesh, 2017).\nScientists indicate that the best type of bitumen for stabilizing soil is impacted by the\ntype of soil being treated, the technique that is employed to build the soil, and the\nexisting weather conditions. Bituminous materials act as a waterproofing agent by\nstabilizing the soil by binding its particles together or protecting it from the adverse\neffects of water. The types of soils that usually yield the best results have a plasticity\nindex of less than 18% and a liquid limit of less than 40% (Gautam & Jaysawal, 2008).\n\nCHAPTER THREE: METHODOLOGY\n\n3.1 INTRODUCTION\nThis part outlines, in detail, laboratory testing and procedures, material acquisition,\nsampling, and data analysis, which were employed in this work.

The soil\nwas classified as a SC, which is a sandy soil that contains some clay.\n4.3.2 Atterberg limits", "word_count": 244, "start_char": 44474, "end_char": 45997}

It is the quantity of moisture in the soil at the point where it changes from a\nliquid to a plastic state. The liquid limit of the sample was found to be 21.3%. This\nimplies that sandy soils will flow more easily when water is added than clay soils,\nwhich expand before flowing (James, 1990).\nThe plastic limit is the moisture content at which soil can be rolled into a 3 mm\nthread without breaking. When soil changes from a plastic to a semi-solid state, it\ncontains this amount of moisture. The plastic limit of the soil was found to be 14.2%\nand hence the plasticity index was found to be 7.1%.\nThe soil's capacity to absorb water is described by the plasticity index. It is derived\nfrom the difference between the plastic and liquid limits. The more the soil's PI\nincreases, the more its volume changes as a result of variations in moisture content,\nand vice versa. It is implied that the sandy soil will not undergo volume changes when\nexposed to moisture conditions because the obtained.\nPI is a relatively low value.

A thin layer forms around each\nsoil particle when water is added to low-moisture soil during compaction. This layer\nacts as a lubricant, pulling the particles closer together and raising the soil's density.\nBecause it allows the soil particles to move freely during compaction, adding water to\nsoil that has a low moisture content leads to low void ratios. As such, as the volume of\nair in the sample decreases and the dry density of the soil reaches its maximum. The\nmoisture content at this point is the optimum moisture content (Shivaprakash &\nSridharan, 2021).\nThe dry density decreases when water is added in excess of the ideal moisture\ncontent. This is because the water fills the voids and forces the soil particles apart,\ndecreasing the dry density of the soil, rather than serving as a lubricant.\nThe soil's OMC was 10.2% and its maximum dry density was 2.008g/cm3. This indicated\nthat the optimal compaction level for this soil is 10.2% moisture content.\n4.3.4 California Bearing Ratio CBR\nCBR is used to measure soil strength.

The sample's CBR was 10, even though the standards call for the\nmaterial to have a CBR of 15. Therefore, this soil must be stabilised before the\nsubgrade can be built (Othman & Abdelwahab, 2023).\nAdditionally, the CBR swell was determined to be 0.75, falling within the general\nspecifications set by the Ministry of Works and Transportation's maximum 1.5 limit for\nG15 material. This suggests that the rate of soil swell is within reasonable bounds.\nSignificant amount of fines in the soil weakens it by causing volumetric changes in\nresponse to variations in moisture content. The loose particle sizes of sandy soils may\nbe the cause of this low CBR value. The soil's non-plastic nature makes it difficult for\nthe particles to bind together to create a more robust soil matrix (Sorsa, 2022).\nSince the soil's tidy qualities make it unsuitable for use as G15 subgrade material,\nstabilization of the material is required to raise the CBR in accordance with the MoWT\nGeneral specifications for road and bridge construction 2005.\n4.3.5 Permeability test\nThe permeability of the neat sandy soil was determined using the falling head method\nand the results tabulated in the table 4 below.\n\nTable 4: Neat Sandy Soil Permeability Result\nTest\nNo.\nH1 (m) H2 (m)\nT(s)\nInflow\nvolume(m3)\nOutflow\nvolume\n(m3)\nHydraulic\nConductivity, K\n(m/s)\n0.132\n0.005\n25.88\n1.27x10-5\n1.08 x10-5\n1.52 x10-4\n0.245\n0.132\n19.32\n1.13 x10-5\n4.63 x10-5\n3.85 x10-5\n0.345\n0.245\n14.28\n1.00 x10-5\n1.04 x10-5\n2.88 x10-5\nAverage\n7.3 x10-5\n\nThe value of coefficient of permeability, k was obtained as 7.3 x10-5m/s which\naccounts for the high rate of infiltration of water through the sandy soil thereby\ncausing erosion.\n4.4 CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF CEMENT KILN DUST\nThe chemical composition of cement kiln dust depends on a number of factors, such\nas the raw material composition, combustion conditions, kiln operation, and process\nparameters (Sorsa, 2022).\nThe table lists the various chemical components of the cement kiln dust that were\nsubjected to XRF analysis.\nTable 5: Neat Soil Chemical Composition\nParameter\nUnits\nResult\nCalcium Oxide\n% m/m\n50.52\nSilicon dioxide\n% m/m\n27.77\nAluminium Oxide\n% m/m\n15.13\nPotassium Oxide\n% m/m\n0.76\nManganese (II) Oxide\n% m/m\n0.26\nIron (II) Oxide\n% m/m\n5.33\nChloride\n% m/m\n0.23", "word_count": 448, "start_char": 48617, "end_char": 51356}

The formation of calcium silicate hydrate gel (tobermorite) depends on\nthese oxides.\nFor the CKD and water mixture to form a CSH gel, the calcium to silica molar ratio\nmust be between 1.6 and 2.5 (citation). The corresponding molar masses of silicon\ndioxide and calcium oxide were divided by the percentages of CaO and SiO2 to\ndetermine the moles of each, as shown below.\nMoles of Cao=\n50.52\n56 = 0.90\nMoles SiO2=\n27.77\n60 = 0.46\nC/S ratio=\n0.90\n0.46 = 1.97\nSince the calcium to silica molar ratio of 1.97 was determined to be within the\nrequired limits, the calcium silicate hydrate gel will form when the CKD is exposed to\nmoisture conditions. This gel will produce a more stable soil matrix by tying the loose,\nsandy soil particles together.\n4.5 STABILIZED SANDY SOIL\n4.5.1 Engineering properties of sandy soils stabilized with varying percentages of\ncement kiln dust\nPLASTIC INDEX VARIATION\nThe observed PI of 8.7 indicated in Figure 8 shows that the clean sandy soil contains\nfines like silt and clay. The PI then gradually drops with the addition of cement kiln\ndust, reaching a value of 7.3 following a 20% addition. The interaction between CKD\nand the sandy clay minerals explains the slight drop in Plasticity index values\nobserved. In addition to filling the voids left by the coarser sand grains, the fine\nparticles that comprise cement kiln dust alter the soil's gradation and lessen reactions\nthat resemble clay. Moreover, the cementitious and pozzolanic processes caused by\n\nCKD bind the soil particles, reducing the range of moisture that the soil can still be\nworked.\n\nFigure 8: Plastic Index Result Variation Graph\n\n4.5.2 Effect of cement kiln dust on proctor values on the compaction\ncharacteristics", "word_count": 348, "start_char": 51107, "end_char": 53172}

This is because the CKD particles\nefficiently fill in the voids left by the sand grains, enhancing particle packing and\nincreasing the soil's density. However, when the CKD content increases to 20%, the\nideal particle interlock is broken, resulting in a drop in the MDD to 1.993g/cm3.\nAccording to Atraa et al. (2015), this is because the soil particles were cemented\ntogether at higher cement kiln dust content levels, which led to the formation of a\ncontinuous structure with stronger connections made possible by secondary reactions\n7.2\n7.6\n8.4\n8.8\nPlasticity Index (%)\n\nand hydration products. The density is greatly reduced as a result of the soil particles\nbecoming stuck together and having little mobility. Excessive CKD causes a less dense\nmatrix and more interparticle spaces by introducing more fines. Furthermore, the\nformation of calcium silicate hydrates, which increase volume but do not increase\noverall density, resulted in a slight decrease in the MDD.\n\nFigure 9: MDD Variation Result Graph\n\n4.5.3 Effect of cement kiln dust on the optimum moisture content\nThe optimum moisture content is impacted when CKD is used in place of clay minerals\nThat absorbs water. The OMC gradually decreases from 5 to 15% CKD addition, from\n10.2% to 8.4% as shown in Figure 10. The soil requires less water for compaction\nbecause CKD increases particle lubrication and decreases the mixture's overall water\naffinity (Athraa et al, 2015). The increased surface area and reactivity of the\nadditional fines, however, increase the water demand because more water is needed\nto support both the pozzolanic reactions and effective particle lubrication, which\nraises the ideal moisture content. As a result, the OMC dramatically increases to\n10.3% at 20%\n1.988\n1.995\n2.002\n2.009\n2.016\n2.023\n2.03\n2.037\nMaximum Dry Density (g/cm3)\n\nFigure 10: OMC Result Variation", "word_count": 368, "start_char": 52882, "end_char": 55162}

The recorded CBR was 16% at 15%, which was higher than the\nminimum of 15 required by MoWT. CBR has improved as a result of improved particle\nbonding and densification brought about by the addition of CKD. By effectively\ncementing the sand particles together, CKD improves pozzolanic processes that\nproduce C-S-H gels as it is shown in Figure 11. This bonding significantly increases the\nsoil's rigidity and load-bearing capacity (Alhassani et al, 2021). The reduction of voids\nto an optimal CKD content further improves particle interlock and load distribution.\n8.5\n9.5\n10.5\nOptimum Moisture Content (%)\n\nFigure 11: CBR Result Variation graph\n\n4.5.5 Effect of cement kiln dust on UCS\nThe results showed a 45% increase in Unconfined Compressive Strength after 15%\ncement kiln dust was added. For CKD levels between 0 and 10%, rapid strength\nincreases are observed when CKD combines with natural moisture to form a\ncementitious matrix that significantly enhances interparticle bonding as shown in\nFigure 12. The rate of strength development slows down between 15 and 20% when\nexcess CKD is present, preventing further compressive strength improvement due to\nreactive site saturation and the introduction of microstructural weakness, such as\nbrittleness, to the stabilized soil matrix (Amadi, 2022).\nCBR (%)\n\nFigure 12: UCS Result Variation Graph\n\n4.5.6 Effect of cement kiln dust on permeability\n\nThe permeability of the sandy soil decreased significantly from 7.3 x10-5 m/s to 8.8\nx10-7 m/s at 15% CKD addition as shown in Figure 13. This happens because the fine\nparticles of cement kiln dust fill in the gaps between the larger sand particles,\nreducing the overall porosity and the size of the water-permeable pores. Chemical\nreactions that bind the sand particles together to create a more cohesive and dense\nmatrix are made possible by the cementitious properties of the dust. This binding\neffect further restricts their connection by making it harder for water to move\nthrough the pore spaces.\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\nUCS (MPa)\n\nFigure 13: Permeability Variation Result Graph\n\nPermeability x10^-6(m/s)\n\n4.6 Research Design", "word_count": 390, "start_char": 54996, "end_char": 57433}
