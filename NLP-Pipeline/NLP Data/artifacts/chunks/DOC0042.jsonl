Today, there are a few women priests in a good number of dioceses in the Church\nof the Province of Uganda. But this revolution against the conservative order of male domination has not\ncome without a price. Women who feel called by God to the ministry in the Church of the Province of\nUganda are usually discriminated against even when they eventually become ordained. One wonders\nwhether women are called by God but ordained by men. This article looks at the work and ministry of one\nof those women who opened the door to the ordination of women in the Church of the Province of Uganda.\nIn her response to the challenges of the time, Njangali not only refused the old definitions of women’s\ninvolvement in church ministry but also guided the whole church to rethink and renew its leadership policy.\n\nKEYWORDS: culture, deacon, feminist, mothers’ union, ordi-nation, province, synod, women’s ministry\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe role of women as ordained ministers has been a matter of debate for many years within Christian\nchurches all over the world. In recent years, the issue of the role of women in the church came up strongly at\nthe World Council of Churches Eighth Assembly in Harare, Zimbabwe, when the delegates from Greek and\nRussian Orthodox churches complained that the majority of the World Council of Churches member\nchurches and denominations ordain women as ministers and priests.2\n\nWhat Paul K.

One must be called and the call must be confirmed by the church. The question, then, is\nwhether God calls women, as he does men, to be ministers in his name. Let those who scruple only consider\nwhat it has cost the church not to use the talents of the woman. Let anyone consult the hymn book and see\nwhat women poets have taught the people of God to sing and then ask what it would mean if such women\nwere allowed to move beyond the relative anonymity of the hymnal to the full visibility men have had in the\nchurch.3\n\nDebates on women’s issues have, in the last few decades, assumed prominence on the Church’s agenda.\nToday, resolutions are constantly being introduced and passed on ways to better the lot of women in the\nChurch. The majority of Christians agree that the ordained ministry of the Church is composed of values\nthat divide into male and female beings and yet women who offer themselves for church service suffer from\n\npatriarchal oppression. This point is well expressed in Ann Warren’s book, ‘Today’s Christian Women’ in\nwhich she says:\n\nWomen whether at home or at work are generally more easily hurt by difficult situations and angry words\nand less able to cope with the cut and thrust of life. We are made as complementary individuals to men and\nwe need their strength, their objectivity and their protection at difficult times. But equally, our very\nsensitivity and vulnerability makes us more ready to recognize our need of God and of his daily power and\nprotection.4\n\nThe majority of women who are in church service have been treated as second-class citizens of the Kingdom\nof God in terms of the roles\n\n2.

One of the church workers to be treated as such was Florence Spetume\nNjangali. She was one of the very few women in Uganda who strived to make women’s ministry in the\nChurch a reality. Not only did she seek ordination for herself but through her work and ministry she also\ninfluenced the Church to pass a resolution allowing women’s ordination in all the dioceses in Uganda. In\nevery Diocesan and Provincial meetings during Njangali’s time, people spoke favorably of their experiences\nwith women dea-cons and other church workers and their significant contributions to the life of their\ndioceses. However, Njangali would always raise some concerns and challenges in the debate. She would\nalways note the absence of women priests. Her concern was the lack of women in positions of real\nleadership in the Church. Njangali was not happy with the way the very few women workers were always\nbeing deployed in the Church. They would be employed as community workers or non-stipendiary deacons\nand thereby used as cheap labor for the Church. She foresaw a long journey ahead toward full and\nmeaningful leadership of women in the Church.\n\nNjangali’s Childhood and School Life\n\nNjangali was born in Parajwoki village, in the present-day Hoima District, on April 10, 1908 to Nyakwebara\nand Eva Kacungira Amooti. Njangali was taught from an early age to love the Church and the Lord God\nwith all her heart. Since her parents were committed Christians, they always took her to attend church\nservices, especially on Sundays. Njangali, therefore, was brought up in a religious home under a Christian\nenvironment. She was a well-behaved and hard-working child and her parents and the entire village were\nproud of her.\nNjangali was baptized on October 31, 1920 in St Peter’s Cathedral, Hoima, and from then henceforth, she\ncame to be known as Florence Septume Njangali. It was a well-attended service, filled with the families of\nthe several candidates from Duhaga Girls’ Boarding School and the surrounding daughter churches. Her\nuncle and king of Bunyoro, Bisereko Duhaga II, attended the function. As she grew up to maturity, Njangali\nwas not only loved by God, but also, as a wonderful warm young lady, loved by her own family and claimed\nas a friend by very many people in Hoima.5", "word_count": 445, "start_char": 3819, "end_char": 6503}

During Njangali’s childhood, there were four kingdoms in Uganda namely, Buganda, Bunyoro, Toro and\nAnkole.\n\nEven though Njangali’s parents strongly adhered to the faith and practices of the Native Anglican Church,\nwhich in 1961 became the Church of the Province of Uganda, her uncle Duhaga was mainly responsible for\nher spiritual nurture. Duhaga had spent some time in Buganda in the household of one of the first ordained\nBaganda priests, the Revd Henry Wright Duta Kitakule, and had shown himself quick to pick new ideas.\nEven when he became King of Bunyoro, Duhaga continued to participate once in a while in teaching\nreading classes at the palace, and at times financed the building of churches in the villages in his kingdom.\nChristopher Byaruhanga says:\n\nThe accession of Andereya Bisereko as king (omukama) Duhaga II of Bunyoro in September 1902 was an\nasset for the establishment and consolidation of the African Anglican Church in Bunyoro. The new king was\nsincerely attracted to Christianity, and gave both the African and European missionaries every possible\nsupport. He also encouraged his people to become active Christiansyhe had good influence on the other\nmembers of his family.6\n\nNjangali’s formative years came to be greatly influenced by the principles and way of life of the Native\nAnglican Church.

Right from the beginning, Njangali was a keen learner of everything around her.\nIn this endeavor she was assisted by her parents and her uncle Duhaga, who was a great supporter of formal\neducation in Bunyoro. Her uncle, Duhaga, willingly paid all the school dues per term and usually\nencouraged her to set her sights higher than the rest of her colleagues. Njangali was one of the brightest\nstudents at Duhaga Girls’ Boarding School, not only excelling in academics but also showing exceptional\ncharacter. She became an active participant and leader in singing hymns, prayers and Bible lesson reading.\nNjangali did well in Religious Knowledge, Geography, Arithmetic, Swahili and in English. English was to\nbe invaluable to Njangali in her later years, giving her the capacity to argue out issues at the national level.\n\n6.

At this early age, Njangali\ndid not clearly know the impli-cations of joining this long tradition. At Duhaga Girls’ Boarding School,\nNjangali met committed teachers who greatly influenced her spiritual life. It was here that she came in\ncontact with the headmistress of the school, Miss M.B.

Leakey\ncame from the conservative, Evangelical wing of the Anglican Church. She held the Bible to be the supreme\nauthority for all matters regarding Christianity. Her teaching was that God inspired the Bible, and that it\ncontained all spiritual truth. The Bible became the sole rule of faith and practice among the students at\nDuhaga Girls’ Boarding School, since they considered it to be the only unerring standard of religious truth.\nLeakey also taught salvation as a definite turning at a specific point away from one’s past sins, to Christ.\nShe always taught her students that following the first step of accepting Jesus Christ as personal savior and\nLord, a convert had to live a holy life committed to Christ. For Leakey, school edu-cation was aimed at\ntelling the world that Christ died as a substitute for sinful humanity. It was this tradition, with great\nemphasis on the Bible and the cross rather than on church tradition, which Leakey would pass on to\nNjangali.8\n\nIn 1925, Leakey retired and was replaced by Miss E.H. Ainley. Ainley also came from the conservative\nEvangelical tradition. In her Christian witness to the girls at Duhaga Girls’ Boarding School, Ainley drew a\nline between people who had undergone the experience of conversion and those who had not. The\nconversion experience, according to Ainley, marked the boundary between Christians and non-Christians.\nOnce converted, according to Ainley, a Christian was\n\n7.

By this time, Njangali had been\nnicknamed by her fellow girls magezi (wisdom) because to them she was as well informed academically as\nher two African female teachers. Njangali began to instruct girls who were even older than her into the\nmysteries of reading and writing. When Njangali completed her studies in 1928, she was appointed a teacher\nand was later promoted to deputy headmistress of the school. Njangali taught her students that Jesus Christ\nexpected them to live by the highest moral standards.\n\nAinley’s leadership style deeply influenced Njangali at a critical junc-ture in her own development, and\ncontributed to the awakening of her sense of vocation. Ainley’s philosophy was hard-work, honesty and\nself-determination. Njangali observed and became interested in Ainley’s way of life and particularly her\ncommitment and conduct as she carried out her duties as headmistress. Njangali was very much impressed\nby the way Ainley carried out her duties loyally, diligently and vigorously without supervision. Njangali’s\nupbringing blended in very well with Ainley’s philosophy and work ethic. When Ainley left in 1938,\nNjangali became headmistress of Duhaga Girls’ Boarding School. Although by this time Duhaga Girls’\nBoarding School was more than fifteen years old, no headmistress had stayed for more than a few years and\nthe school was suffering from lack of constructive long-term leadership.\n\nBy the time Njangali became headmistress, Hoima was a small town, and Duhaga Girls’ Boarding School\nhad grown into a small institution. But Njangali foresaw that Hoima would become a great town and she\nenvisioned the school, at its center, responding to the\n\n9. Concerning the religious beliefs of Miss E.H.

The Speech Day tradition and the joyous participation of the students in the great festivals seized\nthe imagination of the people of Hoima more perhaps than any other one thing, and Duhaga Girls’ Boarding\nSchool took a place of prominence and influence for the schools in Bunyoro.

On October 18, 1938 Njangali fully appreciated what it\nmeant to be personally committed to Jesus Christ. In the East African revival tradition, it is not enough for\nsomeone to merely state that he or she is a Christian or that they are a member of a given church\ndenomination. One must declare to God and the entire church congregation that he or she has made a\npersonal commitment to love and to serve Jesus Christ. In this new understanding of her belief, Njangali\nfound inspiration and comfort in the Christian friendship and companionship of the East African revival\nmovement. The revival movement invigorated and renewed her life and offered her the challenge of a\ndeeper experience of salvation in Jesus Christ and a more radical commitment to Christian discipleship.\nFrom this time on she began to think seriously about joining full-time church ministry.\n\nNjangali’s career at Duhaga Girls’ Boarding School was briefly interrupted when, as a result of her spiritual\ntransformation, she enrolled in Bishop Tucker Theological College, Mukono in 1942 for a two-year Lay\nReader’s course. When Njangali set out for Bishop Tucker Theological College, it was an historic event\nitself. No woman had ever attended that course let alone studying alongside men. She was the only female\nstudent in a class of thirty.10\n\nNjangali completed her Lay Reader’s course in 1944 and returned to Hoima to continue with her duties as\nheadmistress of Duhaga Girls’ Boarding School. She was commissioned as Lay Reader in St Peter’s\nCathedral, Hoima.

Her renewed zeal for the gospel irritated those who resisted the implications of her message,\nespecially among the relatively sophisticated men working at the school. Njangali always emphasized\nrepentance through open confession, the breaking down of barriers of clan or tribe and the equality between\nmen and women.12\n\nUnder Njangali’s distinguished leadership, Duhaga Girls’ Boarding School expanded and gained national\nrecognition as a center of excellent academic standards. Njangali’s own educational background helped her\nto guide and inspire her students to aim higher in life. Soon the Native Anglican Church in Uganda\nrecognized Njangali’s work and influence and in 1953, she was appointed a member of the Native Anglican\nSynod in Uganda. As early as 1909, Bishop Tucker had come up with a type of Constitution that would give\nmore power to the Ugandan Christians from all over his diocese to manage their own church affairs. In this\nConstitution, church members were to elect their representatives to the Synod. There were two guiding\nprinciples of Tucker’s Constitution, namely, concentration and decentralization. It created at the center a\nstrong governing body that would carry the weight, which only a truly representative body can.\n\nThe Native Anglican Church Synod in Uganda was such a repre-sentative body. It consisted of members, of\nwhom not more than a third were clergy, drawn from every part of Uganda. Each district in Uganda was to\nelect so many representatives in proportion to the number of communicants. Njangali represented Bunyoro\ndistrict. The Native Anglican Church Synod was a democratic body. Europeans, kings, chiefs and the\nindigenous Ugandans sat together and voted on equal terms, the indigenous delegates forming the large\nmajority. All questions of outstanding importance were referred to the Synod and its decisions were binding\non all members of the Native Anglican\n\n11.

As a representative body, the Synod counted among its members many of the most powerful\ntraditional leaders in the coun-try. Consequently, the Synod had a remarkable influence in the Native\nAnglican Church, and commended, as no other body did at the time, the confidence of the country. Njangali\nwas proud to belong to such a powerful entity.\n\nNjangali was also a member of the Diocesan Council that acted for the Synod in the interval between its\nsessions. The members of the Diocesan Council were appointed by and responsible to the Synod. It\nconsisted of two delegates from each of the large districts, which formed the diocese. It met once a month\nand to it the minutes of all local councils and of all its own advisory Boards were submitted. The more\ndetailed and departmental work of the Diocesan Council was entrusted to a variety of Boards, which were\npurely advisory and reported to the Council. In this way, the work of the Native Anglican Church was\nunified and centralized.\n\nFor quite long, Njangali was part of that controlling power of the Native Anglican Church in Uganda. Her\nexperience in the Native Synod, the Diocesan Council and from 1961 in the Provincial Assembly gave her a\nunique opportunity to learn about the principles of democracy, self-government and self-support. As a\nmember of the Synod, Njangali was very instrumental in the creation of the Church of the Province of\nUganda with a new Constitution. Tucker’s 1909 Constitution was succeeded by the 1961 Church of the\nProvince of Uganda and Rwanda-Burundi Constitution. The 1961 Constitution was accepted and approved\nby the Synod and the Diocesan Council of the Upper Nile on April 27/28, 1960, and came into effect in\n1961. Article 1 of the 1961 Constitution reads:\n\nThe Church of this Province shall be named the Church of the Province of Uganda and Ruanda-Urundi\n[Rwanda-Burundi] and shall consist in the first instance of the following Diocesesy.Northern Uganday.\nSorotiy.Mbaley.Namirembey.West Buganday.Ankole-Kigeziy. Ruanzori [Ruwenzori]y.Ruanda–Urundi\n[Rwanda-Burundi].13\n\nNjangali was happy with the 1961 Constitution which, like the 1909 Constitution, had a built-in ability of\nweakening tribal boundaries and barriers, thus creating a comprehensive church. But she was always critical\nof the Church Missionary Society missionaries who tended to favor the central region.

Njangali often argued that the horizontal conflict\nwithin the Church would compromise the original idea of a comprehensive Church of Uganda.\n\nNjangali’s fear of the horizontal conflict within the Church was confirmed at the time of Archbishop Bishop\nBrown’s resignation in 1965. Brown was British and had been Bishop of Namirembe, the cathedral\nheadquarters of the Church. So long as Brown was Arch-bishop of the Church of the Province of Uganda\nand Rwanda-Burundi and the Diocesan Bishop, Namirembe also functioned as archdiocese of the Province.\nAnd Namirembe Cathedral was popularly regarded by all Christians in Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi as the\nProvincial Cathedral. As soon as Bishop Brown announced his resignation, the question of who was to\nsucceed him became one of the hottest issues in the Province. Since Namirembe Cathedral was in the\ntraditional Baganda territory, and the Baganda were the largest single tribe in Uganda with the biggest\nnumber of Christians, the majority of the Baganda Christians thought that a Muganda Bishop would succeed\nBrown. It was at this time that Njangali transferred her services to Ruwenzori diocese to work with Bishop\nEric Sabiti who later became the first archbishop of the Church of the Province of Uganda, Rwanda and\nBurundi. When asked what was at stake in the Church in 1965, Njangali said, ‘in 1965, seniority was not an\nissue, but tribe. By showing tribal sentiments in 1965, the Baganda lost any possible support from their\ncolleagues for the post of Archbishop’.14\n\nNjangali as a Lay Theologian\n\nUndoubtedly Njangali did more than any other woman in the Church to help women gain access to\ntheological education. In 1957, she retired from her position as headmistress of Duhaga Girls’ Boarding\nSchool and returned to Bishop Tucker Theological College for an ordination course the following year.\nNjangali’s decision to resign her post and join full-time church ministry surprised many Christians in\nBunyoro.

Why should one leave a well-paying job for a dead-end position in\nchurch ministry and more so when she is a woman? Some people would ask.

For instance, during this\ntime Bishop Tucker Theological College administration allowed Njangali as the first woman student to\nstudy theology much earlier than anyone ever thought of the ordination of women in Africa. Eventually,\nBishop Tucker Theological College women graduates, especially Njangali, were influential in the ordination\nof women campaigns. When Njangali signed up for theological training alongside men at the college, she\nwas not easily accepted in the lecture room by her male counterparts. Olivia Nasaka says:\n\nWhen Florence was admitted in BTTC the whole nation got shocked at her move. Despite all, she stood her\nground and joined the college. The first slap in her face was the realization that there was no space for her in\nthe lecture rooms. The staff members and the students were all perplexed, how could a woman sit in the\nsame room with them and study theology? Did she have the capacity to absorb the contents given by the\nlecturers?15\nCommenting on her experience as a woman training for church ministry at Bishop Tucker Theological\nCollege, Njangali said:-\n\nDuring my theology course at Bishop Tucker Theological College, a number of things were revealed to me\nabout how a woman is perceived by men in the Church of the Province of Uganda. The first day I reported\nfor lectures in a class of male students, I never believed what I heard and saw. I was told to sit outside and\nstudy from the veranda! That experience did not stop me from participating positively in any discussion.\nSometimes I would stand and openly challenge what I considered oppressive tendencies against women.\nHowever, my active participation in discussions was in most cases viewed by my classmates as arrogance.16\n\nThroughout her theology course, Njangali took it upon herself to defend the rights of women as equal\npartners in church ministry.

Where it was necessary for women to be excluded from some traditional matters that\nnecessitated serious discussions, to arrive at the final decision and implementation, women could not be\nexcluded or else those decisions would fail. For instance, while leadership in traditional marriages was\nlargely retained by the father of the girl or the boy, the leadership role in discerning what was needed for the\noccasion would include the views of the mother of the girl or boy.\n\nNjangali was of the view that of all the doctrines of the church, Christology was the one most used to\noppress women because of the way the maleness of Jesus was being interpreted. She said that the fact that\nJesus was a male human being was beyond question. That this was a historical fact that had to be respected.\nHowever, the problem arose when during her time the maleness of Jesus was taken for granted as the only\nproper way to represent God. Njangali disagreed with those church leaders who used to say that God is more\nsuitably thought of in an analogy with male human beings.

She used to argue\nthat Jesus’ preaching proclaims justice and peace for all people, inclusive of women. That the reign of God\nis diametrically opposed to any group setting itself up as exclusively privileged and relegating others to the\nperiphery. At this time, the clergy in Uganda were a formidable group opposed to the young women\nenthusiasts for gender equality. However, Njangali always exploited one of the consistent themes of the East\nAfrican revival movement, namely, its opposition to authoritarianism in church life. Even then one of the\noutstanding characteristics of Njangali was her fundamental loyalty to the Church. Despite her strong, often\npassionate criticism of the Church, she saw herself as called to witness to her church from within.\nWhen Njangali graduated from Bishop Tucker Theological College in 1960, she was posted to Ankole-\nKigezi diocese not as a deacon but as a ‘church commissioned worker’ to head the Mothers’ Union\nDepartment. Mothers’ Union was very well known, as it is today, for its desire to have everyone married to\none partner in the church. Its understanding of marriage to be a lifelong commitment falls within the African\nunderstanding of marriage. It is believed in many African\n\nsocieties that from the very beginning of human life, God commanded people to get married. Therefore,\nmarriage for Africans is a sacred duty. Once the full contract of marriage has been executed, it is extremely\nhard to dissolve it. The Mothers’ Union considers marriage to be like the rites of passages in Africa, which\ncan never be repeated by individuals. For this reason, Mothers’ Union is against divorce.17\nNjangali worked to further the ideals of the Mothers’ Union and to promote the dignity of women by\npresenting monogamy as the best solution for marital relations. She taught that openness, integrity and\nhonesty — characteristics of healthy relations between committed Christians — should apply even more to\nthe marital relationships to foster real sharing, mutual love and respect. Thanks to her efforts within the\nMothers’ Union in Ankole-Kigezi diocese, women gained the right to confess, testify, preach and pray on an\nequal basis with men.", "word_count": 423, "start_char": 28665, "end_char": 31254}

She was always conscious of the way in which\nwomen are perpetually relegated to second-class citizenship in the Ugandan society and in the Church. She\nalways said that ‘this should not be; this is against the will of God’. The vision that guided Njangali’s\nfeminist theology was that of a new human community based on the values of mutuality and reciprocity. In\nher ministry as Mothers’ Union worker, Njangali always encouraged women in Ankole-Kigezi diocese to\nlove to work with men. The reason she usually gave was that God created women and men to help each\nother and not one sex to oppress the other. She used to argue that her goal was not to reverse oppression,\nwith women oppressing men; that would be the same problem in reverse. Her conviction was that women\nshare equally with men in the dignity of being human. Njangali looked forward to a church with no one\ngroup dominating and no one group being subordinated, but men and women participating according to their\ngifts. She did not envision that men and women be the same, but that the uniqueness of each be equally\nrespected in a community of brothers and sisters.18\n\nToday, feminist theology, which Njangali pioneered, is divided roughly into two categories, namely,\nrevolutionary and reformist. The revolutionary feminist theology is produced by women in Uganda who,\n\n17. As women were not allowed to be ordained as deacons even at the out-come of the ordination course,\nthey were called ‘church commissioned workers’.\n18.

She\nopened up a new space for women within the Church. During Njangali’s time it was often said, as it is\nsometimes said today, that women who were unmarried had no status at all in society. They would agree\nwith John S. Mbiti who says:\n\nFor African peoples, marriage is the focus of existence. It is the point where all the members of a given\ncommunity meet: the departed, the living and those yet to be borny.Marriage is a drama in which everyone\nbecomes an actor or actress and not just a spectator. Therefore, marriage is a duty, a requirement from the\ncorporate society, and a rhythm of life in which everyone must participatey.Failure to get married under\nnormal circumstances means that the person concerned has rejected society and society rejects him or her in\nreturn.20\n\nAs an unmarried woman and as Mothers’ Union worker, Njangali was in a very interesting position but her\nunderstanding of Gal. 3.28 helped her to reconcile her status as a Christian and the concepts of society\naround her.21\n\nIn her feminist theology, Njangali always emphasized the point that ‘the value of a woman begins when she\nis born, not when she gets married’. The role played by Njangali in bringing changes in the status and roles\nof women is now receiving more attention in Uganda. She broke with the traditional roles considered\nnormal for women church workers, and became a legend in her own time. Her advocacy of independence\nfor women went beyond what was considered correct in the Church.

She recruited\nthe unmarried women into the Mothers’ Union as ‘Associate members’. Associate members in the\nMothers’ Union have continued to redefine women’s roles in Uganda. Njangali is now seen by many\npeople as a change agent in the Uganda church history.\n\nIn 1965 she transferred her services to Ruwenzori diocese and even-tually to Bunyoro-Kitara diocese in\n1972. In all the three dioceses, Njan-gali assumed a position of great significance and came to be recognized\nas the foremost figure in the Church. When Bunyoro-Kitara diocese was formed in 1972, Njangali was one\nof the faithful supporters of Bishop Yustus Ruhindi’s garuka nkokwoli (return as you are) philosophy.\n\nNjangali was also involved in building ecumenical relations between the major denominations in Uganda,\nnamely, Roman Catholic and Anglican Churches. In 1963, Njangali attended the All Africa Conference of\nChurches Consultation in Kampala, Uganda, in which she partici-pated in a discussion on the place of\nwomen in the church. She believed that the role of any church was to meet the needs of the local community\nand that if Christian denominations in Uganda continued to engage in religious wars against one another, the\nneeds of the local community would never be met. Njangali argued that the church in Uganda was called by\nChrist to shed the gospel light on God’s poor and broken people, rather than to allow inter-denominational\nquarrels to perpetuate the darkness of Uganda’s painful past history that had shamefully defined the\nchurch.22\n\nNjangali also believed that Christians in Uganda were called to live in a unity that respected diversity. She\nupheld the value of denominations but she also underlined the inherent dangers, saying that Christians in\nthese denominations were called, as Christ’s own, to respect the dignity and wholeness of every human\nbeing.

Those\nopposed to her ordination would note that throughout the Hebrew Scriptures, and from the early Christian\nChurch to Njangali’s time, God always chose only men for all leadership positions. That in ancient times,\nonly men of a specific Jewish tribe could act as priests. This act of discrimination was rooted in the cultural\nbias of Ugandan men. During Njangali’s time, men argued that God had appointed women to be subordinate\nto men and, therefore, there was no basis for Njangali to rule over men in any way. But Njangali always\nreminded the church that within the African traditional religion, there were numerous female deities, female\nmediums, female priests and female diviners. Men of all ranks paid respect to them. Although in the\nUgandan traditional society women had a role in the spiritual sphere, this did not lead to the assumption that\nthey could have a leadership role in the church. Perhaps the reason was that there were no women priests in\nthe Christian Church at this time. For Njangali, the dis-crimination of women in the church seems to have\ncome from the European culture but not from the African culture. She quickly used to point out that Jesus\nChrist broke with the tradition of male superiority on many occasions and that St Paul acknowledged female\nministers. By allowing women ordination, Njangali argued, the church would be returning to Jesus Christ’s\npattern of gender equality.\n\nDebate over the Ordination of Women in the Anglican Communion", "word_count": 356, "start_char": 37844, "end_char": 40052}

Men occupied all major decision-making positions. The debate over the\nordination of women in the Anglican Communion began in the 1920s with the debate over the entry of\nwomen into the diaconate. In 1944 Florence Tim Oi Li was ordained in Hong Kong. The 1948 Lambeth\nConference rejected a proposal from Hong Kong that would have validated Li’s ordination to the priesthood,\nwarning that such an action would be against the Anglican tradition and order, and would gravely affect the\ninternal and external relations of the Anglican Communion. Eventually Li withdrew from active ministry in\nthe face of pressure on her bishop from the Anglican Communion.\n\nIn 1964, Phyllis Edwards was ordered deaconess in the Episcopal Church, and based on the current\nchanges, her bishop announced his intentions of admitting her to the diaconate without re-ordaining her.\n\nIn 1968, the Lambeth Conference agreed on women deacons and encouraged study of ordination of women\nas priests and referred all debates concerning this issue to the first meeting of the Anglican Consultative\nCouncil in 1971.\n\nIn 1971, the Anglican Consultative Council meeting in Limuru, Kenya, declared that it was acceptable for a\nbishop to ordain a woman to priesthood with the consent of his national church or province. The Council\nsaid:\n\nIn reply to the request of the Council of the Church of South-east Asia, this Council advises the Bishop of\nHong Kong, acting with the approval of this Synod, and any other bishop of the Anglican Communion\nacting with the approval of his Province, that if he decides to ordain women to the priesthood, his action will\nbe acceptable to this Council; and that this Council will use its good offices to encourage all Provinces of\nthe Anglican Communion to continue in communion with these dioceses.23\n\nBy the end of 1977, a good number of women in the Anglican Communion were ordained priests.24", "word_count": 383, "start_char": 39708, "end_char": 42077}

However, such recog-nition\nwas never granted without a serious battle. However, some bishops in the Anglican Communion remained\nopposed to the ordi-nation of women and refused to consider women candidates in their dioceses. Some\nchurches remained open on this issue and the Lambeth Conference expressed the same consensus by\ncommending respect for those people who held differing views on the ordination of women to priesthood.\nWhile debates continued over the ordination of women to priesthood, the 1980s brought about the question\nof the ordina-tion of women to episcopacy. In 1988 a Convention of the Diocese of Massachusetts elected\nBarbara Harris as Suffragan bishop.

Wilson Turumanya, the former Diocesan\nSecretary and retired Bishop of Bunyoro-Kitara, argues that Njangali’s relation to the royal family was not a\nfactor in her becoming the first deacon in Uganda, rather her ordination was the result of Bishop Ruhindi’s\npolicy of utilizing the empowering values within Christian Scripture and the Western culture such as\nequality and freedom to improve the status of women in his diocese.26\n\nWhile some lay people and the clergy welcomed Njangali’s ordi-nation, others were outraged.

This meant that a woman could be an assistant but not a full member of the clergy.\nMany dioceses in the Church preferred to continue with the practice of commissioning women. During\nNjangali’s time, the majority of men and the clergy in the Church presumed to speak for God as they\ndemanded for total obedience of women. It was therefore not easy for a lot of women in Uganda to\nexperience God as empowering when they were in the Church’s ambit. The majority of women in the\nChurch’s ambit experienced God as a source of women’s oppression and Jesus as the author of the exclusion\nof women from sacramental roles in the Church. But Njangali always saw herself clearly as the elect of God.\nHer intense loyalty to Jesus Christ shaped and directed her character. She was a woman totally available to\nthe purposes of God. She knew she was a woman chosen to bind up the broken and to lift up the\ndowntrodden women in Uganda. No matter the cost of personal hardship, Njangali never shunned from the\ncall to duty. She was a woman ready to comply at once with Jesus Christ’s wishes for women in the Church.\n\nAlthough Njangali was very influential, as a deacon, her status was not encouraging. For instance, she\nrarely preached as she had no parish. Her major work was to serve women through Mothers’ Union. Even\nunder such circumstances, Njangali continued to advocate for the loving acceptance, due recognition and\nsympathetic support of deacons and other women workers in the Church as co-participants in the church\nministry along with men.

She hoped that\nwomen workers would be willing to talk about the reality of women’s experiences in their sermons and\ntherefore be able to make connections between church, home and society. That in itself Njangali thought\nwas a possibility for women to be included in the telling of the story of faith to the community of faith. She\nwas of the view that the body language of women and men working together in ministry would be a gesture\nof men and women sharing leadership and responsibility. Njangali warned women deacons and other\nwomen church workers against the attitude of competition between them and men, a power struggle and a\nsearch for positions of dominance, or mere wars between the sexes. Njangali’s argument was that no matter\nhow logical an argument in support of ordination of women might seem, if it deviates from the biblical\nvalues of equality, mutual respect and the dignity of persons, that argument ceases to be valid. She always\nsaid that the Bible texts that are for and against the ordination of women must be approached with a new\nperspective, neither from the point of view of women nor from the point of view of men.28\n\nIn Uganda, the ordination of women was started in Kigezi diocese where, in the 1960s, Njangali had worked\nas the head of the Mothers’ Union Department. In 1983, with the support of his own diocese, Bishop Festo\nKivengere of Kigezi ordained three women as priests in spite of official opposition from the Church.
