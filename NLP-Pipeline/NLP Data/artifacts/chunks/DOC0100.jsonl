As\nboth adopters and influencers of developing technologies, educational institutions are\nkey players at the core of this digital revolution. Uganda Christian University (UCU),\nas a distinguished education institution of higher learning in Uganda, is not excluded\nfrom the profound effects that these technological developments will have on how its\nacademic community consumes media.\nDigital journalism emerged as a distinct type of journalism in the 21st\ncentury(Eldridge, 2019), and social media enable radical new ways to gather and\nverify sources and information(Deuze, 2017). All these are outcomes of emerging\ntechnologies. This is in addition to more conventional media like radio, television, and\nnewspapers. The introduction of this new technology has completely changed how\npeople interact with information as well as how media material is created, shared,\nand consumed(Pavlik, 2014a). UCU finds itself at the crossroads of digital and\nconventional media, embracing the opportunities and challenges that come with this\nrapid change.\nAcademic institutions across the globe are adopting digital platforms, e-learning, and\ninteractive technologies in order to improve student learning(Zhuang et al., 2017).

For instance, it has blended learning which involves the\nuse of physical classes and online ones for lectures. In addition, student activities like\nvoting are also done online using an e-voting app called e-Chagua.\nThe UCU ICT Services Directorate has developed a 10-year plan to turn the university\ninto a data-driven institution using Artificial Intelligence to determine the essential\nresources and drive decisions made by management (Luba, 2023). This move was\nmade after the COVID19 pandemic altered physical operations of the institution. Since\nthen, online learning has grown by 50% though a major hindrance has been the price\nof internet connectivity in the country.\nIn the particular setting of UCU, this study investigated the effects of new\ntechnologies on media consumption in society. It delved into the multi-layered\nrelationship between the academic institution's embrace of technology and the\nevolving media consumption habits of its community which includes the educators\n(lecturers) and students.\nThe use of new technology effectively in higher education is essential to prepare\nstudents for its increasing demand, (Thomas, 2010). According to (Edmunds & Morris,\n2000) although there is an abundance of information available, it is often difficult to\nobtain useful, relevant information when it is needed. Understanding how emerging\ntechnology shapes the media consumption habits of UCU's academic community is\ncrucial for aligning the institution's educational strategies with the evolving needs and\npreferences of its members.", "word_count": 300, "start_char": 13170, "end_char": 15230}

This applies to the academic organization as well as the larger\ncommunity that it serves. The environment in which media is consumed is changing\ndue to the widespread adoption of innovative technologies(Ley et al., 2014).\nThe current handheld mobile devices may be appropriate for consumption of rich\nformats of information by students via desktop and handheld mobile devices(Gafni &\nGeri, 2015). There is also diversification of media formats that basically change how\nusers engage with content. This is through formats like Augmented Reality (AR) and\nVirtual Reality (VR). Another effect of these technologies is the rapid spread of\ndisinformation and fake news. This is due to the increased access of the media on\nboth a user level and content creation level.\nHowever imperative understanding its implications on society is, there is limited\nresearch on how emerging technologies are affecting the consumption of media in\ninstitutions of higher learning. This study investigated this within the specific context\nof UCU.\n1.3\nGeneral Purpose\nThe general purpose of this study was to examine the implications of emerging\ntechnology on societal consumption of media. This is within the precise setting of\nUCU.\n\n1.4\nSpecific Objectives\nThe specific objectives of the study were:\n1. To identify the emerging technologies applicable to the media scope of Uganda\nChristian University.\n2. To examine the present media consumption trends and patterns among Uganda\nChristian University's teachers and students.\n3. To identify the benefits and challenges of emerging technology in media\nconsumption.\n1.5\nResearch Questions\nThe study was guided by the following questions:\nRQ1: Which emerging technologies are applicable to the media scope of\nUganda Christian University?\nRQ2: What are the present media consumption trends and patterns among\nUganda Christian University's teachers and students?\nRQ3: What are the benefits and challenges of emerging technology in media\nconsumption?\n1.6\nScope\nThis section explains the areas this research covered geographically, content-wise and\ntime-wise.", "word_count": 398, "start_char": 14833, "end_char": 17507}

It focused on its academic\nenvironment that consists of the students and faculty members.\n1.6.2 Content Scope\nThe content focused on the media technology used in the university and its effects on\nhow media is interpreted. It also includes the factors that influence the use of this\nemerging technology. This was an educational and social context within UCU.\n1.7\nTime Scope\nThis study covered a period of two months. The timeframe aligned with the academic\ncalendar of the university for purposes of collecting data, analysing it, and producing\nmeaningful results. It enabled me to access the students and lectures who are major\nsubjects of this research.\n1.8\nJustification\nThis study is relevant to institutions of higher learning. UCU serves as an ideal case\nstudy to understand the impact of these technological changes on both academic\ninstitutions and the broader society. Additionally, the necessity of understanding how\nnew technologies may affect media consumption habits in the context of higher\neducation served as justification for this study.\n1.9\nSignificance\nThe study provides insightful information about how media consumption in\neducational environments is influenced by developing technologies, which might\n\nimprove teaching strategies and further higher education. Through an analysis of the\neffects of technology on media consumption within the larger framework of UCU, this\nresearch also offers strategies to maximise the opportunities while minimizing the\nrisks that come with the use of these advancements.\n1.10 Theoretical Framework\nThis study was situated within the Uses and Gratifications Theory (UGT), which\nfocuses on the needs and motivations of media consumers. It was introduced in the\n1940s, and is attributed to Jay G Blumler and Elihu Katz’s work in 1974. The major\naspects of this theory that were employed are explained below.\nThe uses and gratifications approach is a vantage point for understanding media\nexposure and effects(Swanson, 1992). In the context of emerging technology, it was\nused to investigate which technologies are used to consume media by individuals at\nUganda Christian University and why.\nThe subjective aspects of the media itself will allow for personalizing the content\naccess beyond today's facility.(Venkatesh et al., 2008) This theory can enabled me to\ninvestigate how students and staff members use this technology to fulfil their specific\ndemands.", "word_count": 423, "start_char": 17190, "end_char": 20000}

The first gives a review of the theory on\nwhich the study was based. The second briefly explains the concept of emerging\ntechnologies. The third looks at how emerging technology is being utilized in\ninstitutions of higher learning. The fourth expounds on media consumption in the\ndigital age and the fifth looks at previous studies conducted on similar topics.\n2.2\nTheoretical Literature Review\n2.2.1 The Uses and Gratifications Theory\nThe idea that audiences are active consumers who choose and use media for their\npurposes, rather than passive recipients of media messages, is what gave rise to the\ntheory in the 1940s and 1950s. The emergence of computer-mediated communication\nhas revived the significance of use and gratifications(Ruggiero, 2000).\nAssumptions of the theory\nThe Uses and Gratifications Theory suggests that by choosing the content they want to\nconsume, viewers are active media participants(Kasirye, 2022 a). Media consumers\nare also increasingly conscious of the factors that influence the kind of media they\nchoose to consume (Kasirye, 2022 b). Traditional media and modern media are in\ncompetition, as modern media has qualities that do not exist in traditional media\n(Sridharan, 2023).\nCritiques of the theory", "word_count": 244, "start_char": 19735, "end_char": 21319}

The theory has been faulted for ignoring\nthe larger societal context in favour of concentrating on personal motivations and\ngratifications. This individualistic viewpoint ignores the ways in which cultural norms\nand societal structures impact media consumption(Stafford et al., 2004).\nIt also downplays the role of the media and its ability to shape opinions and influence\npeople’s decisions. Moreover, much as the audience is considered fully active in this\ntheory, it does not account for the passive nature of some audiences(Stafford et al.,\n2004).\n2.3\nThe concept of Emerging Technology\nIn recent years, there has been a lot of debate and investigation on the rise of\nemerging technologies. These are brand-new, innovative technologies that are\nexpanding quickly and have the power to significantly change how society and the\neconomy operate. According to (Rotolo et al., 2015), the attributes that feature in\nthe emergence of novel technologies are radical novelty, relatively fast growth,\ncoherence, prominent impact, and uncertainty and ambiguity\n2.3.1 Emerging technology in institutions of higher learning\nUniversities are utilizing emerging technologies to boost student involvement and the\nquality of the learning environment. One of these ways is through blended learning, a\nteaching procedure that combines traditional, in-person classroom instruction with\nonline or digital learning(Assistant Professor, Thiagarajar College of Preceptors,\nMadurai et al., 2023)This is through learning management systems, video conferencing", "word_count": 288, "start_char": 21014, "end_char": 22989}

In addition, online tests are used to\nmeasure student learning and offer feedback. By using these tests, schools may raise\nthe standard of instruction and make sure that students are reaching learning\nobjectives.\nOpen educational resources are rapidly becoming important elements in support of\nOpen Educational Practices and the Open Education Movement in higher\neducation(Berti, 2018). These are being utilized through emerging technologies. They\nreduce the costs students would incur in purchasing hard copy versions as most\nuniversities opt to subscribe to online libraries for their students. It also eases\nresource accessibility for students who may not be able to access the physical library.\nAccording to (Villegas-Ch et al., 2019) Artificial intelligence is being employed by\nuniversities to personalize learning. This is through examining students' learning\nbehaviours, performance, and preferences.\nUniversities leverage cyber security as an emerging technology in a number of ways to\nsafeguard sensitive data, their digital infrastructure, and the privacy of their students\nand staff members. This is made possible through identity and access management\nsolutions enable this through like single sign-on and multi-factor authentication.\nThese check user access and ensure only authorized individuals can access sensitive\nresources.\n2.4\nMedia Consumption in the Digital Age\nMedia consumption has changed significantly in the digital age.

With the unparalleled ease, customisation and interactivity of this digital\nenvironment, people can tailor their media intake to suit their tastes.\nBut there are also downsides, such as concerns about false information, privacy and\ninternet addiction. The digital age has brought unprecedented access to information\nand the need for critical media literacy to function in this ever-changing and growing\ndigital environment(Pavlik, 2014b).\n2.4.1 The effects of emerging technologies on media consumption patterns\nMedia consumption patterns have been significantly influenced by new technologies.\nThese are some of the key findings.\nThe way that people consume media has changed due to emerging technologies like\ndigital libraries and streaming services, which allow for on-demand access. Media\nconsumption has also become extremely mobile with the widespread use of\nsmartphones and tablets. Due to content being accessible on the go, people are\nconsuming it more frequently and for shorter periods of time.\nMixed reality has melted the boundaries between physical and virtual realities\n(Stapleton & Hugh, 2006).

The way audiences interact with content has evolved as a\nresult of this diversity.\nWith this new technology, user-created material can now be created and shared on\nsocial media sites. These include Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, to mention but a few.\nThis ability to actively participate in content creation influences media consumption\nhabits. On the downside this leads to the spread of disinformation and fake news.\nAnyone can be an information disseminator which raises issues of credibility.\nSocial networks are a news medium and the decline of traditional media, and\nnewspapers in particular(Casero-Ripollés, 2012).People are relying more and more on\ndigital channels for up-to-date information. Emerging technologies have a wide range\nof implications on media consumption habits, both beneficial and detrimental. These\ntechnologies have made content more tailored and increased accessibility possible,\nbut they have also brought up issues with privacy, screen time management, and the\nquality of the information provided.\n2.5\nPrevious Studies\nPavlik, ( 2014b) highlights how emerging technologies are transforming journalism,\nmedia, and society in terms of participatory nature, methods of creation, content,\nand organizational structures. According to Pavlik, whereas digital technologies that\nare widely available and affordable are enabling people to interact and create, they\nare also giving governments, businesses and other organizations the ability to\nmonitor, censor and control citizens.

Smartphones facilitated by the\ninternet can be used to create and distribute media content in addition to consuming\nit. Mobile Broadband Networking is imperative when using mobile devices as it\nenables users to communicate and access the internet. The forms of broadband\nnetworking identified by the study are Wi-Fi and cellular. Immersive Media through AR\nand VR is also recognized as emerging technologies.\n3D media is moving beyond entertainment in cinemas to information media like 3D\nprinting and graphics. Applying a branch of Artificial intelligence known as natural\nlanguage processing to big data, a number of pioneering computer, data and\njournalism scientists have developed powerful data-driven machine writing\napplications which is threatening the jobs of journalists.\nWoo et al.,( 2014a)focuses on the effect of new media, particularly the Internet and\nsmart mobile media, on consumer media usage in South Korea, revealing shifts in\npreferences and the synergistic effect of mobile media on television use.

This method\nprovides a comprehensive understanding of the topic, is consistent with the\nqualitative nature of the study, and makes it easier to look at contextual elements.\n\nCase studies are especially useful for examining intricate, real-world occurrences\nbecause they offer in-depth, deep insights into the subject matter(Crowe et al.,\n2011).\n3.4\nThe Qualitative Approach\nThis study will employ a qualitative approach, which is a means for exploring and\nunderstanding the meaning individuals ascribe to a social or human issue (Awasthy,\n2019). According to Creswell (2009), it involves emerging questions, data typically\ncollected in the participant’s setting, data analysis inductively building from\nparticulars to general themes, and the researcher making interpretations of the\nmeaning of the data.\n\nThe qualitative method was a suitable choice for this research because it enabled me\nto explore in detail the complex and changing dynamics of media consumption as\ninfluenced by emerging technologies. I was able to use this technique to capture\npeople's experiences, motivations and perceptions in response to technological\nadvances.\n3.5\nProcedures for data collection\nResearch techniques are a wide range of strategies for collecting, analysing and\ninterpreting data for research projects (Poynter, 2012). Interviews as a research\ntechnique were employed in this study.\n3.5.1 Interviews", "word_count": 414, "start_char": 29130, "end_char": 31955}

In-depth interviews\nwere employed in this study. It is a qualitative research technique where individuals\nwith relevant knowledge or experience in a particular area are interviewed to gather\ndeep insights and information. They involved semi-structured questions that allowed a\nmore detailed exploration of my research topic. The key informants for these\ninterviews were students and lecturers of UCU, from the School of Journalism, Media\nand Communication.\nAmong their major advantages, the key informants gave in-depth insights as they have\nexperience and knowledge in using technology to consume media. They also provided\nan opportunity for open-ended questions allowing the respondents to share personal\nexperiences.\n3.6\nData Collection Instruments\nThis includes the methods used to measure the variables in a specific manner. This\nresearch was carried out using primary data: information was gathered directly from\nthe sources. As mentioned above, the data was collected through in-depth interviews.\nThey were conducted with a focus on the three major objectives of the study to\nobtain the relevant findings.\nAn interview guide with semi-structured questions was used to give the interviews an\norganized flow while leaving room for additional responses. The respondents were\naudio recorded with their consent and the audios were transcribed for a more\nefficient analysis process.\n\nThe study used thematic analysis to measure, and analyse the data. This is a flexible\nqualitative research method for identifying, analysing, and reporting patterns\n(themes) within data(Gupta et al., 2019). By thoroughly reviewing the transcribed\ndata, initial codes were created which were combined into themes. They were then\nrefined and the findings from this theme were presented, with supporting quotes from\nthe participants.\n3.7\nPopulation and sampling techniques\nExplorable (2009) defines a research population is generally a large collection of\nindividuals or objects that is the main focus of a scientific query. The target\npopulation for this study was Uganda Christian University community with focus on\nthe students and lecturers.\nSampling enables researchers to conduct studies about a large group by using a small\nportion of that population (Investopedia, 2007). The different sampling techniques\ninclude random sampling, purposive sampling, stratified sampling and convenience\nsampling.\nGiven that the topic required particular expertise and knowledge, I employed\npurposive sampling. The sample size was six participants: three students and three\nlecturers.\n3.8\nQuality Control", "word_count": 450, "start_char": 31570, "end_char": 34686}

It\nalso utilized a trustworthy measuring instruments and methodologies.\n3.8.2 Validity\nTo ascertain this study, I employed semi-structured questions in the in-depth\ninterviews. Given that the sample population included individuals well versed with\nthe topic, it raised the validity of the study’s findings.\n3.9\nEthical Considerations\nA major ethical consideration for this study was privacy and confidentiality. All the\nparticipants' identities were hidden to maintain privacy.\nInformed consent also ascertained that the respondents understood the purpose of\nthe study. None of them were forced to take part in the study and all the interviews\nwere carried out at their places of preference.\n3.10 Methodological constraints\nThe results of the study are specific to the cases or individuals studied. Uganda\nChristian University despite being a relevant case study may not be representative to\nhigher institutions of learning that have not embraced technology. Furthermore, the\nkey informants’ views may have been determined by personal biases, experiences,\nand interests.\nCarrying out the key informant interviews was time consuming and resource intensive\nwhich called for planning, scheduling and coordination.\n\nCHAPTER FOUR: DATA ANALYSIS, PRESENTATION, AND\nINTERPRETATION\n4.1\nThis chapter delves into the emerging technologies applicable to the media scope of\nUganda Christian University, media consumption patterns in the university and\nbenefits plus challenges of using these emerging technologies. The study answered\nthree research questions developed from the specific objectives; RQ1: Which\nemerging technologies are applicable to the media scope of Uganda Christian\nUniversity? RQ2: What are the present media consumption trends and patterns among\nUganda Christian University's teachers and students? RQ3: What are the benefits and\nchallenges of emerging technology in media consumption? The necessary data was\nobtained through key informant interviews. This chapter highlights the results and\ndiscussions of the study findings.\n4.2\nPresentation, analysis and interpretation\n4.2.1 Emerging technologies applicable to the media scope of Uganda\nChristian University\nIn this section, the first research question is addressed identifying the specific\nemerging technologies used at UCU, how they are being used in media projects and\nfactors that influence their adoption.\nArtificial Intelligence", "word_count": 395, "start_char": 34370, "end_char": 37189}

R2 noted that students should not be discouraged from using AI, but\nrather taught how to supplement their media content with it otherwise they are at a\nrisk of misusing it. The common AI tools that the participants noted were Chat GPT,\nPerplexity AI and Meta AI. R5 explained that various website development\ntechnologies like Word Press and Wix are AI oriented which eases the production of\nmulti-media projects.\n“I use the magic AI feature in Word Press to get suggestions on how to make my work\nbetter and fine tune my blog articles which I publish on the site.”\nLive streaming\nUganda Christian University has various programs for its community like Sunday\nService, Community Worship, Talk to Mama Pesh, exhibitions, among others. R6 noted\nthat through live streaming these events via You Tube, those who are not on campus\nare able to join virtually in real-time and benefit from the engagements.\n“The best part is that these streams are kept on the UCU You Tube channel so even if\nI cannot tune in while Community Worship is happening, I can watch later.”\nLive streaming is also done in social media applications like X (formerly Twitter),\nwhere individuals or groups hold forums called X spaces, to discuss matters of public", "word_count": 246, "start_char": 37167, "end_char": 38681}

Participant 3, 4 and 5 take part in these meetings that tackle issues like\nsports, politics, and climate change.\nVideo conferencing applications\nThe participants expressed gratitude for the university’s blended learning model, (50%\nonline teaching, 50% physical class) which enables students and lecturers to meet\nonline. They do so through video conferencing applications like Zoom, Google Meet\nand Google teams. Zoom for example, has the recording feature where the session\ncan be shared after for those who were not able to attend. R2 pointed out that this is\nencouraging distance learning, in which the university teaches post-graduate students\nabroad. R5 noted:\n“This has aided our lecturers as well that they don't need to come here physically,\nthey can choose to stay or remain where they work.”\nThe Moodle platform\nMoodle is an open-source learning management system used for blended learning,\ndistance education and other online learning projects in learning institutions (Aydin &\nTirkes, 2010) It was founded by Martin Dougiamas, an Australian AI scientist. By\nenabling lecturers to post teaching material on the platform, students easily access\ntheir course material. It also allows lecturers to teach in real time using the Big Blue\nButton, an open source virtue classroom software (Ukoha, 2022) that is integrated in\nMoodle.\n\nMoodle is used hand in hand with Alpha, a management information system where\nvital student information like timetables and results are uploaded. Students are also\nable to register for the respective semester and keep track of their progress.\nParticipants 1 and 3 noted Moodle as an effective platform for communication\nbetween lecturers and students. R1 however, noted an alternative for lecturers who\nmay find it difficult to use the learning management system:\n“The old school lecturers are actually using Zoom and Google Meet for teaching\nstudents.”\nIt should be noted that these systems were approved by the National Council for\nHigher education (NCHE), which does periodic assessments to ascertain whether the\ntechnology is effective.\nThe Standard Digital\nThe Standard Digital is an online community news outlet for Uganda Christian\nUniversity. The physical paper was established in May 2007 and was produced bimonthly, until it later took a digital route. Stories that inform, educate and entertain\nare shared on the platform which is accessed beyond even the university borders. R1,\n3 and 4 all shared that it is a platform that addresses key issues in the community. R4\nexplained personal benefits the online newspaper has provided.\n“My writing has really gotten better through writing for The Standard.

Through it, immersive content is being\ngenerated by journalists today so that audiences feel like they are in the story.\nThough it is relevantly new in the university, the community is able to experience VR\nthrough initiatives like Information Communications Technology (ICT) week where\nthese technologies are exhibited. It is also being taught and used in media courses, as\nexplained by R4.\n“When we learnt multimedia production as a class, we had a session in which we\ninteracted with virtual tour apps to create our own virtual tours. It was very\ninformative as I did not know that it was possible for me since I am not an ICT\nstudent.”\nAll the informants expressed appreciation for eduroam, the university’s Wi-Fi\nnetwork which is free for all students and staff members as it facilitates the use of", "word_count": 287, "start_char": 41116, "end_char": 42870}

Wi-Fi is a wireless networking technology that uses radio waves to\nproduce wireless high-speed Internet access.\n“When I'm at campus, I'm inclined to use Wi-Fi because it's readily available here and\nit's easily accessible at campus which has reduced my costs on internet as a student.\nAs a journalist in training I heavily rely on internet to use the various media\nplatforms.”\nImpact of COVID-19\nAll the respondents acknowledged the effects of COVID-19 to various sectors of the\ncountry, including the media UCU had to adapt to the digital transformation that was\naccelerated by the virus as it had students that were pursuing various courses. It\nfound ways of teaching and examining students virtually, which became beneficial for\nthe university as it faced an increase in international students due to distance\nlearning.\nThe growth of The Standard Digital is largely attributed to the pandemic as it\nencouraged The School of Journalism, Media and Communication to take advantage of\nthe fact that everyone was online according to R5. R1 noted that Moodle came into\neffect in the university just as the country was struck by the pandemic.\n“By the way before COVID-19 we didn’t have serious online learning.

R4 explained:\n“There’s an economic aspect in the increased use of these technologies. Previously\nsome of these gadgets were expensive but now the cost is coming down. And then\nthere's also support, especially in the education sector that works towards robust use\nof this technology.”\n4.2.2 Media consumption trends and patterns among Uganda Christian\nUniversity's teachers and students\nThe second research question is addressed in this section, highlighting types of media\nthe UCU community engages with and factors that influence media consumption\npatterns at the university. It also draws a comparison between previous trends to\ncurrent ones, and also compares the patterns between the different respondents.\nDigital media versus Traditional media\nAll interviewees noted that the digital transformation has led to the decline of\ntraditional media. This is media that originated before the internet, including\nnewspapers, radio, and broadcast television.\nConsumers are now able to produce content as well making them ―prosumers‖ which\nis increasing the competition between digital and traditional media(Izvercian & Alina\nSeran, 2013).

In regards to radio and broadcast, only R1 and R6 listen to the radio and watch\nTV on a regular basis. R2, 4 and 5 access information from the social media sites of\ntraditional media houses like New Vision and Daily Monitor. R1 and R3 access\ninformation from the online news sites of these media houses, in addition to the\nsocial media platforms. R6 does not use social media sites.\n“When I enter class not even one student has a newspaper, and you rarely see\nnewspapers in the university. This does not mean that they are not informed on what\nit going in the country, our class engagements are always filled with current topics.”\nThis emphasizes the reliance of the community on digital media. The shift is evident\nin the media consumption patterns as R2 noted that podcasts are now outcompeting\nradio amongst students and even lecturers. In addition to the diversity podcasts now\nprovide, it is easier to listen to them since with radio one needs earphones if they are\nusing a phone. Emerging technologies are being used to develop these media\nplatforms.\nGeneration Z, commonly known as Gen Z is the name given to individuals born\nbetween 1997 and 2012 (Warren, 2022). They are advocates for digital media which is\nalso leading to its growth. This is because they frequently use social media platforms\nlike X to consume and disseminate information. In R2’s words, ―we are living in an era\nwhere people are way more tech savvy.‖ R1 also pointed out:\n“We are dealing with young people in particular who love modern technologies and\nso they would prefer to use modern technologies than using the old traditional\ntechnologies. They also want to look fancy in one way or another.”", "word_count": 346, "start_char": 45393, "end_char": 47436}

R4 and R5 use it for tutorials on how to carry out some class projects,\nas well as uploading their course work for grading. R1 and R3 use it to expand their\ninformation on certain topics while R6 uses it to watch documentaries.\nThe features enabling this in You Tube include the download feature where one can\nwatch the video offline on their phones. R5 is also taking advantage of the platform to\npost content on a personal You Tube channel that has over 1,000(1K) subscribers.\nFactors that influence media consumption habits\nA major factor that is influencing the use of emerging technologies to consume the\nmedia according to the participants is convenience. One simply needs to have a\nmobile phone with internet connection and they can easily use these technologies.\nMost of them like AI have free versions that provide the required information unlike\ntraditional media means for instance newspapers where you have to pay money and\naccess the information.\n“It is also accessible because you don't have to go to the newsroom to the library to\nread a newspaper. You can sit in your room in a hostel, open a website and read the\nnewspaper online.”\nAnother factor that was noted is peer influence, especially amongst the Gen Z.

R3 and R4 noted that through our mobile phones\nwe can access information without paying for it. This is also closing the information\ngap that previously existed between those who could access information and those\nwho could not. R2 added:\nIn the past, some students and lecturers would afford to buy newspapers and read\nthem and others would not afford to buy these newspapers and read them. But\nbecause we can now access content free of charge on our cell phones, for example,\non mobile phones, all of us are somewhat equal. As long as you have a phone with\ninternet means that you can actually access what I'm accessing.\nR5 explained that as emerging technologies like AI have simplified the English\nlanguage for him as he is not a native English speaker. It is useful as they are able to\ninterrogate a subject even better.\nEmerging technologies have also enhanced learning for students as they are able to\ncarry out research much easier. By typing in a desired topic the internet provides\ninformation through various data bases.\nWe used to rush to the library to look for books to read which was a struggle due to\nthe process of borrowing books.

In the\nrealm of these technologies students are not simply assessed on their ability to find\ninformation, but also on the methods of presentation.\nI have seen how well our journalism and communication students prepare their\ncourse work with this emerging technology. This will enable them to become better\nmultimedia journalists that produce content that is well optimized for the web\ntoday.\nFor individuals who have mastered how to use these different technologies, they are\nable to monetize this through selling their content produced using them or\nconducting work shops where they teach others how to use them for a certain fee. R2\nand R5 have benefited monetarily from sharing knowledge and skills during seminars\nfor a fee. The competitive job market in the country now requires one to be well\nacquainted with technological advancements lest they risk being out competed and\nlosing their jobs.\nPeople all over the continent are now more interconnected than ever due to these\ntechnologies. They are able to share opinions through live streaming in social media\nplatforms like Instagram and video conferencing platforms like Zoom. This is exposing\nthem to different ideologies and trends, increasing the information base in different\ncountries.\nOn the downside, the most cited challenge was overdependence on these\ntechnologies.

R4 and R6 both used the term ―gospel truth‖ in relation to\nhow the youth perceive this information. They thereafter share it on social media\nplatforms which leads to the spread of disinformation and misinformation. R6 noted:\n“These technologies are subject to abuse, especially to younger minds which are not\nenlightened as they may take it as gospel truth. I don't think it's any different from\nwhere people used to think professors know everything, that what he tells you is a\ngospel truth or a bishop or even the president.”\nR3 added “Many young people, who cannot differentiate between what is accurate\nand what is propaganda, end up taking everything they read on social media as being\nfactual. Yet, in many instances, there's a lot of information that's not factual and is\nshared through platforms like X spaces.”\nUse of these media technologies to consume the media has limited physical\ninteractions.

The chapter also consists of conclusions from the findings of the study and\nrecommendations for future research.\n5.2\nDiscussion of key findings\nThe discussion of key findings was based on the research objectives and guided by the\nresearch questions.\n5.3\nDiscussion on the emerging technologies applicable to the media\nscope of Uganda Christian University\nThe findings reveal that AI, live streaming, video conferencing, Moodle and Virtual\nReality (VR) are being used to enhance media consumption and production. AI is one\nof the most used emerging technology as it is used to structure content for\ndistribution. The popular AI tools include Chat GPT, Perplexity AI, Copilot and most\nrecently, Meta AI. The other most used emerging technology is live streaming which is\nused for events and real-time conversations in social media applications like X\n(formerly Twitter). Video conferencing applications like Google Meet and Zoom are a\nrecent favourite for lecturers in UCU as they facilitate online learning. It is furthered\nby applications like Zoom that enable recorded classes that can be used by learners\nwho were not able to attend on time and those who want to re-visit the lectures.", "word_count": 281, "start_char": 56262, "end_char": 58064}

The university has\nexperienced an increase in international students due to distance learning. The\nincreased accessibility to technological devices and support from the NCHE has also\ncontributed to the increased use of these technologies.\n5.4\nDiscussion on media consumption trends and patterns among Uganda\nChristian University's teachers and students\nThe UCU community has gradually shifted from traditional media to digital media. An\nexample of this shift is the fact that none of the participants of the study read\nphysical newspapers daily, they instead rely on the online versions of national\npublications like New Vision and Daily Monitor. The younger participants rely on the\nsocial media platforms of these entities for their news. The rise of digital media has\nled to the decline of traditional media with prosumers who produce and consume\ncontent.\nPodcasts are also gaining popularity, outcompeting radio among students and\nlecturers. The study also found that Gen Z is driving the growth of digital media,\nfrequently using social media platforms like X to consume and disseminate\ninformation. Accessibility and convenience are major factors influencing media\nconsumption habits with participants citing the use of their mobile phones as a\nmeans. Peer influence is another significant factor particularly among the younger\naudience that wants to stay current with trending topics and platforms.", "word_count": 288, "start_char": 57746, "end_char": 59612}

It is more convenient and affordable, closing the\ninformation gap in the country. This has also broadened the learning scope for\neducators who can now assess competence beyond a learner’s ability to gather\ninformation.\nA major concern however is on the overdependence on these technologies. This leads\nto laziness and limited critical thinking. Furthermore, the inaccuracy of information\nand spread of fake news facilitated by these technologies is affecting the media scope\nof Uganda. The digital divide is another major challenge with some individuals lacking\naccess to network connectivity or affordable devices.\n5.6\nConclusion\nUltimately, the findings of this study illustrate that emerging technologies are\naffecting how media is consumed at Uganda Christian University. British American\ntheoretical physicist Freeman Dyson once said, “Technology is a gift of God. After the\ngift of life it is perhaps the greatest of God’s gifts. It is the mother of civilizations,\nof arts and of sciences,” which is exhibited through the positive implications of\nconsuming the media using emerging technologies. However, they also pose\nsignificant negative implications that need to be mitigated. Like Norwegian historian\nChristian Lous Lange said, “Technology is a useful servant but a dangerous master.”\n\nThe findings of this study provide valuable insights for policymakers, educators and\nmedia students in institutions of higher learning. As emerging technologies continue\nto develop, evolve and shape the media landscape, it is imperative to prioritize media\nliteracy, critical thinking and responsible media consumption. This can ensure that\nthe benefits of these technologies are utilized while preventing the negative\nconsequences. Overall, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of the use\nof emerging technologies to consume the media, emphasizing the factors that lead to\ntheir use and adoption, and their implications.\n5.7\nRecommendations\nBased on the findings, this section presents possible recommendations for policy\nmakers and further research.\n5.7.1 Recommendations for policies", "word_count": 381, "start_char": 59312, "end_char": 61924}

Through this, policymakers like NCHE and educators can give students and\nthe youth at large the necessary skills to assess and consume media content. They can\nalso collaborate with popular figures in society who have a better chance at reaching\nthe young people and educating them. By promoting responsible technology use,\npolicy makers can mitigate some of the negative implications of emerging technology\nlike misinformation and disinformation.\n5.7.2 Recommendations for further research\nWhereas there are various studies on the implications of social media for journalism\nand communication, there is limited research on emerging technologies as a whole.\n\nLongitudinal studies should be constructed to track the long-term effects of emerging\ntechnologies on media consumption patterns and their impact on different aspects of\nsociety. These include education, social interactions and mental health.\nThe research should also be expanded to include comparative studies across different\ncultural, social and economic contexts, within the country. This will provide a more\ncomprehensive understanding of the implications of emerging technologies on media\nconsumption in diverse settings.\nIn-depth studies on user behaviour and perceptions towards emerging technologies in\nmedia consumption should be carried out. This is because different individuals have\ndifferent ways they interpret and use information. Through this, factors that\ninfluence the adoption and use of these technologies will be identified, informing the\ndevelopment of more user based policies.", "word_count": 288, "start_char": 61557, "end_char": 63581}
