The tests performed in the\nlaboratory included: density, compressive strength, tensile strength and water. At\n1.5% fiber content, the best result was reached giving a compressive strength of 3.7\nMPa, a tensile strength of 1.08 MPa and a density decrease to 1325.5 kg/m3, which\ncorresponds to a dead-load reduction of 26.36%. To conclude, sisal fibers particularly\nat 1.0-1.5% serve as an excellent reinforcement and contribute to the strength,\ncracking resistance, and durability of woodcrete, which can be used as a very good\nlightweight material for non-load bearing construction in Uganda.\n\nii\n\nDECLARATION\nI, BABIRYE ESTHER KIRULE hereby declare that this is work originally done by me, it\nis not plagiarized and has not been submitted to any institution for any award.\n\nBABIRYE ESTHER KIRULE\nSignature: ......................\nDate: .........................\n\niii\n\nAPPROVAL\nI Certify that this report is for BABIRYE ESTHER KIRULE and I fully accept that she\nhas been under supervision and submitted to the Faculty of Engineering, Design and\nTechnology of Uganda Christian University in partial fulfilment of the requirements\nfor an award of a Bachelor of Science in Civil and Environmental Engineering.\n\nSignature: .........................\nDate: ............................\nMR.

Dead loads represent the majority\nof the forces that building elements must withstand, frequently making up 70–90%\nof the total load in reinforced concrete constructions (Ghani et al., 2019). The\nincrease in permanent loads leads to a rise in bending moments, shear forces and\npressures on foundations, which consequently cause more reinforcement and higher\nstructural costs. According to, a reduction in wall unit materials weight leads to a\nreduction in these internal forces and thus better structural performance. The\nunending rise of urban centers has rendered the weight of traditional masonry units\na decisive factor not just in these areas but also where structural performance with\nlower cost is required (Holm et al.,2007). Consequently, the removal of permanent\nloads has become one of the main tactics of modern building. The transition to\nlightweight construction technologies has been the most effective one among other\nalternatives (Kulbhushan et al., 2018).", "word_count": 396, "start_char": 11124, "end_char": 14027}

Hempcrete is extremely light and possesses a variety of\ncompressive strength from 0.2–0.5 MPa and it even attains 1.2 MPa in dense mixes\n(Asghari et al., 2014). Structural lightweight aggregate concrete has a density range\nvarying from 1,120 to 1,920 kg/m3 along with compressive strength of nearly 17 MPa\n(Holm et al., 2007). For AAC density is generally around 400–800 kg/m3 and the\n\ncorresponding compressive strength values range between 2–7 MPa. Foamcrete\noffers a wider spectrum of light building materials with 400–1,600 kg/m3 density and\n1–10 MPa strength depending on the density. These lightweight materials have shown\nto reduce wall masses by 25-60%, by reduction in density this minimizes demand for\nlarge structural elements (Dias et al.,2024).\n\nAmongst the mentioned technologies, woodcrete which is a composite material that\nis produced by mixing wood waste (sawdust, wood shavings, wood chips) with\ncement. Depending on the binder type and curing conditions the density ranges from\n800-1,200 kg/m3 and compressive strength range of 0.6–3.89 MPa (Hornby, 2020).\nUse of woodcrete utilizes the use of wood waste which further enhances the need\nfor smart and green construction that requires use of locally available materials.\nThis technology uses recycled wood waste and this significantly lowers embodied\nenergy and CO2 emissions one variant reduced net CO2 compared to conventional\nconcrete. Although untreated composites lose strength over time lime or cement\ntreated sawdust retain their compressive strength after one year and this\ndemonstrates durability under environmental exposure (Khelifi et al., 2022).\nTherefore, woodcrete is sustainable (low carbon, uses local waste) which makes it\ncost‐effective and durable when properly treated while still delivering moderate\nstructural performance (Fadiel et al., 2022).\n\nIn Uganda, the importation of lightweight materials is still quite slow,\nnotwithstanding the fact that quite a number of research works have been carried\nout on alternatives like papercrete bricks and rice-husk composites.

The fast pace of urbanization in the country has\ncreated a challenge for the construction sector of coming up with low cost and\nsustainability measures at the same time. Woodcrete is a solution that suits Uganda's\ngreen construction agenda since it is made from sawdust which is abundantly\navailable in wood-processing firms. Therefore, it becomes both a cost-effective and\na feasible option for both small and large developers working with local communities.\n\nDespite the benefits, the use of woodcrete has not been adapted greatly especially\nin this part of the world and some of the reasons could be because woodcrete\nexhibits significantly lower mechanical strength compared to other conventional\nlightweight materials like light weight concrete (Dias et al., 2022). This underlying\ncause of low strength can be attributed to high porosity and weak interfacial\ntransition zones that result from the mismatch between wood and cement matrix\nand the hygroscopic behavior of wood which introduces moisture fluctuations\ncausing micro-cracking and dimensional instability. Recommendations like\nreinforcing woodcrete have been given by researches to enhance the mechanical\nproperties of the material (Aigbomian et al., 2013). Various fibers are used in\nconstruction for reinforcement these include natural fibers, steel, bamboo, sisal,\njute, plastic, and others (Anas et al., 2022). Different building materials like\nconcrete have been reinforced with a various fiber and this has shown improvement\nin the compressive strength and decrease in the density. Of the different fibers, sisal\nis considered best among others for its high tensile strength 350-840 MPa, stiffness\n9 - 38 GPa and a relatively low density of 1.33-1.45 g/cm3 (Bichang’a et al., 2022).\nIt is also very durable and has a lower water uptake compared to most the fibers\nused. Also, less water uptake compared to the following natural ones makes sisal\n\nbe more durable when used in cementitious composites. In different parts of the\nworld, sisal is found in various forms of building materials to increase ductility,\nresistance to cracking, and energy absorption. As for Uganda, which is an abundant\nsource of sisal, the use of it in woodcrete reveals an eco-friendly and sustainable\nlocal reinforcement solution. Hence, the idea of utilizing sisal-reinforced woodcrete\nopens the door to a potential development of lightweight, durable, and inexpensive\nconstruction units that can meet the housing demand in Uganda with their excellent\nqualities.", "word_count": 436, "start_char": 16043, "end_char": 18909}

These loads\nalso reduce the integrity of the structure. One of the elements that lead to increase\nof permanent loads are masonry units i.e., concrete blocks which have a density of\nover 1800 kg/m3 which means they have great mass. Use of alternative units to have\nlighter structure is a necessity in construction of low-cost houses. Having lightweight\nmaterials as construction units would reduce on permanent loads thus having\nreduced size of structural elements designed which reduces the cost of construction.\n\nAccording to literature, woodcrete blocks have shown great potential as light weight\nbuilding materials although they have structural limitations because of low strength.\nThis is ascribed to the high porosity and weak interfacial transition zones result from\nthe mismatch between wood and cement matrix and the hygroscopic behavior of\nwood which introduces moisture fluctuations causing micro-cracking and\ndimensional instability (Aigbomian, 2013). Sawdust cement composite has a low\n\nplastic deformation, under low stress it deforms easily due to the compressible\nsawdust's moisture-sensitive lignocellulosic structure. This quality reflects low\nrigidity, high porosity and weak fibre-matrix bonding which leads to weak load\ntransfer and early micro cracks.", "word_count": 269, "start_char": 18527, "end_char": 20360}

To confront this\nchallenge, sisal fibre can be incorporated in the mix. Sisal fiber is a natural fiber\nknown for its high tensile strength ranging from 350 to 840 MPa, stiffness varying\nbroadly between 9 and 38 GPa and density relatively low for a natural fiber at\napproximately 1.33–1.45 g/cm (Bichang’A et al., 2022). It is also very durable and\nhas a lower water uptake compared to most the fibers used. Studies have shown\nthat sisal fiber contributes to mechanical interlocking with the cement paste and\nabsorbs less water than other natural fibers enhancing the bond strength (Zziwa et\nal., 2006). Therefore, this research aimed to assess the suitability of using sisal fibre\nas a reinforcement in woodcrete blocks.\n1.3 MAIN OBJECTIVE\nTo assess the suitability of using sisal fibre as a reinforcement in woodcrete blocks.\n1.4 OBJECTIVES\n1.

Sisal is a lignocellulosic\nfibre derived from Agave sisalana and it exhibits high tensile strength, low density,\nand has a fibrous surface morphology that supports good mechanical interlocking\nwith cementitious matrices (Silva et al., 2020). Its chemical composition rich in\ncellulose contributes to a hydrophilic nature due to the presence of hydroxyl (–OH)\ngroups which enhances compatibility with polar materials like cement paste (Anas\net al., 2022). In porous composites like woodcrete, where poor interfacial bonding\nfrequently results in cracking, this encourages strong fiber matrix adhesion, an\nessential characteristic. Additionally, a number of studies have demonstrated that\nsisal fiber absorbs less water than many other natural fibers, which enhances\ninternal curing and the slow release of moisture during hydration. This supports the\ncontinuous formation of calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) improving the matrix\nstructure and compressive performance (Silva et al., 2020). Alkali treatment such as\nwith NaOH also improves fibre durability and bonding capacity by removing\nhemicellulose and enhancing surface roughness.\nSIGNIFICANCE\nThis research contributes to the knowledge base by providing data on the use of\nreinforced woodcrete blocks as a building material in Uganda.

The mixture is poured into a reusable mold or a form which is\nthen cured in a controlled atmosphere, moved to the building site, and either placed\nor raised into position. A precast concrete block is mainly utilized as a material for\nthe construction of walls of buildings and is sometimes referred to as a Concrete\nMasonry Unit (CMU). The process of making precast concrete blocks takes place at\nthe ground level which contributes to the safety of the whole project. The industry\nis stricter about the quality of materials and workmanship in a precast plant than in\na construction site. The forms used in a precast plant may be reused one hundred\nto one thousand times before they need to be replaced, hence the cost of formwork\nper unit is lower than for site-cast production (Allen, 2009).", "word_count": 424, "start_char": 24573, "end_char": 27379}

Dimensions of 39cm x 19cm x (30cm or 20 cm or 10cm) or 2-inch, 4-inch,\n6-inch, 8-inch, 10-inch, and 12-inch unit configurations are the most common sizes\nof concrete blocks (Kamal, 2022).\nThe most significant mechanical property of concrete blocks is the compressive\nstrength and generally the minimum compressive strength of 7 MPa is required for\nload-bearing walls (Neville, 2011).\nIn Uganda, they are the major players in the building market due to the low price of\nraw materials and the presence of labor, however, the quality of blocks remains a\nmajor challenge. Mwesigwa et al (2021) indicate that more than one-third of blocks\n\nchecked in Kampala did not comply with the minimum strength standards owing to\npoor mixing and curing techniques.\nDense and heavy solid concrete blocks have densities that vary between 1,800 and\n2,200 kg/m3. Their compressive strengths frequently vary between 7 MPa and 15\nMPa, thus making them particularly ideal for load-bearing applications, such as the\naforementioned foundations and walls that resist forces. Nevertheless, due to their\nbulkiness, they play a major role in the total dead load of buildings, which may, on\nthe other hand, raise foundation costs and also restrain their application in the case\nof skyscrapers where weight efficiency is paramount (Neville, 2011).\n\nOn the other hand, hollow concrete blocks are less heavy and are obtained either\nby utilizing less aggregate content or by integrating voids in the units. Their density\nis usually between 1,100 and 1,500 kg/m3, while the compressive strength lies in\nthe range of 5-12 MPa (Kamal, 2022). The primary use for, hollow concrete blocks is\nin the construction of partition walls and non-load-bearing structures. The voids,\nbesides making the blocks lighter, provide insulation against noise and heat transfer.\nFurthermore, the use of hollow blocks also means reduced consumption of cement\nand steel in construction. Nevertheless, they are fairly susceptible to the entrance\nof water vapor and hence proper plastering is needed for long-lasting performance\n(Neville, 2011).\n\nLightweight blocks are the newest revolution in the quest for to lighten the weight\nof masonry.

Due to their low density, the walls\nmade of AAC blocks are lighter and better insulators, but their lower strength\ncompared to other types of concrete restricts their use to non-load-bearing or lowrise buildings. In the same way, the making of concrete blocks yields a product that\nis either comprised of foam or non-foam concrete. her the foaming agents are added\nto the cement slurry, producing the foam concrete blocks with final densities as low\nas 400 kg/m3 and strengths from 1 to 10 MPa (Jones et al., 2005). The main\napplication of concrete blocks is in providing thermal and acoustic insulation, but\nlimited to non-loadbearing on account of the variable strength and the latter of the\napplication being more prone to shrinkage.\n\nThe process of manufacturing concrete blocks is very much dependent on the right\nmixing ratios of each of the components: cement, aggregates, and water. The use\nof too much water results in the production of weak units with low compressive\nstrength while the use of less water than what is required results in poor quality\ncuring which leads to low durability (Neville, 2011). In the informal sector of Uganda,\nmanual mixing often leads to improper proportions which then produce blocks that\nfail to meet the minimum strength requirements set by regulations (Mwesigwa et al.,\n2021). As the saying goes, \"the devil is in the details\" which in this case means that\nthe quality control has to be very strict and the production method mechanized.\nThe usage of concrete blocks in construction greatly influences the structural\nperformance mainly through their density and compressive strength. Heavy and firm\nblocks support greater loads but add significantly to the dead loads while light blocks\nlower the structure's weight and enhance insulation but demand reinforcement or\n\nmixing with stronger materials for durability.

Normal weight concrete typically has a density in\nthe range of 2200–2600 kg/m3, while lightweight concrete falls within 800–2000\nkg/m3 (Neville, 2012). Materials with a density below 800 kg/m3 are further\ncategorized as ultra-lightweight concretes, primarily used for insulation rather than\nstructural purposes (ACI, 2014).

This classification is\ncrucial as it informs the potential structural application of each material, where\nhigher densities are associated with structural strength and lower densities with\nthermal and acoustic insulation.\n2.2 Woodcrete\nWoodcrete is one interesting composite material that is made by blending wood\nwaste like sawdust, wood shavings, or wood chips into a cement-based mixture, thus\nresulting in a lighter and more environment-friendly alternative to the traditional\nconcrete. It is the main reason for the devaluation of timber and sawmill waste as\nit is a vital contribution to green and sustainable construction by minimizing the\ncosts of construction and reducing landfill waste (Abdullah et al., 2019). Its most\nimportant feature is its much lower density, which normally lies in the range of 600\nto 1,600 kg/m3, whereas common concrete density is about 2,300 to 2,400 kg/m3\n(Aigbomian et al., 2013). The initial density reduction is because of the non-woodlike structure of the wood particles, which not only reduces the bulk mass but also\ngives good thermal insulation. The thermal conductivity of woodcrete is said to be\nin the range of 0.1–0.4 W/mK, while that of normal concrete is around 1.7 W/mK\nmaking it very usable for energy-saving buildings (Fadiel et al., 2022).\n\nOn the contrary, in the case of portland concrete, the failure is normally due to the\nsudden brittle cracking of the cement matrix, whereas the wood composites undergo\nprogressive crushing and pull-out of the wood particles. This gives rise to the\nphenomenon of better energy dissipation and crack arresting.

These thermal,\nacoustic, and mechanical...\n2.2.1 Standards for woodcrete\nCurrently, there is no general international standard that dictates the mix\nproportions, performance thresholds, or classification of woodcrete which forces\nresearchers to depend on the testing methods for concrete and masonry. Aigbomian\nand Fan (2013), for example, evaluated the compressive strength and dimensional\nstability of sawdust–cement composites through ASTM C39 and ASTM C140 standards.\nTheir study showed that the compressive strength of the blocks with sawdust content\nof 50% was more than 2.0 MPa.\n\nTherefore, they have taken the minimum requirement given in ASTM C129 for nonload-bearing concrete masonry units, which set strength limits of about 1.4–3.5 MPa\naccording to the unit classification. Similarly, Fadiel et al. (2022) tested woodcrete\nblocks against the performance criteria of EN 771-3 for aggregate concrete masonry\nunits, and, when the sawdust content was no more than 40%, the density and waterabsorption thresholds were found to be within acceptable limits. All these methods\ndemonstrate how researchers are taking existing masonry and concrete standards,\nin the absence of dedicated regulatory guidelines validating the structural suitability\nof woodcrete, applying them to woodcrete very well. The dependence on general\nmasonry and concrete testing standards underscores the necessity of a dedicated\nwoodcrete standard that will promote its extensive use and acceptability.", "word_count": 296, "start_char": 35109, "end_char": 37169}

As per researches, the strength and density of blocks produced out\nof fine sawdust through a 2 mm sieve are greater than those made with coarse\nsawdust (Fadiel et al., 2022). On the contrary, the use of particles greater than 5\nmm results in highly porous material with low compressive strength, but such\nmaterials are still preferred for their excellent thermal insulation properties\n(Aigbomian et al., 2013). For obtaining uniform grading and for reproduction\npurposes, sawdust is usually dried in an oven and then sieved with standard ASTM or\nBS sieves; the 2 mm or 4.75 mm sieve-fraction is then collected for further\nprocessing (Okereke, 2015).\n2.2.3 Mix ratios for woodcrete\nRecent studies have revealed that the performance of woodcrete and sawdustcement composites is significantly affected by the wood species, binder ratio, and\nparticle size. Aigbomian and Fan (2013) found that beech and oak, among hardwoods,\nproduced woodcrete with the highest strength and density corresponding to 3.93\nMPa in compressive strength, while softwoods, on the other hand, produced cedar\nand pine with only 0.07 to 1.37 MPa. They also indicated that a particle size of 1\nmm considerably enhanced the compressive strength related to the better packing\nof the particles and more efficient stress transfer between the particles and the\nbinder.\n\nThey also suggested a ratio of sawdust to binder 1:2 as the optimum for ensuring\ngood bonding and workability. Zziwa et al. (2006) in their research, which\nstrengthens the previous findings, have stated that sawdust-cement composites with", "word_count": 326, "start_char": 36752, "end_char": 38875}

Moreover, they pointed out that moisture exposure could reduce\nthe strength of the composite by as much as 40%, which indicates their vulnerability\nto wet conditions. All the studies combined the alpha that the mixes with the finest\nhardwood sawdust and the highest binder content deliver the best mechanical\nperformance, while the high-wood-content mixes provide the insulation at the\nstrength expense.\n2.2.4 Fibre reinforcement in wood composites\nThe use of natural fibres together with cementitious materials is not only a matter\nof changing the physical properties of the final product but also of increasing\ntoughness, post-crack ductility and better control of cracking. Nevertheless, this\nlatter benefit has not yet been demonstrated in the case of woodcrete; most\nevidence supports the use of toughened concrete or mortar. Da Gloria and Toledo\nFilho (2021) established the sandwich panels, consisting of a wood bio-concrete core\nwith cement skins reinforced by sisal fibres and reported a considerable increase in\nflexural strength, stiffness and energy absorption as compared to panels without\nreinforcement.\n\nThis illustrates the possibility of the combination between bio-aggregates and lignocellulosic fibres to work in a composite system. As Jamshaid et al. (2022) did the\nsame, they found that along with jute, sisal, coconut and sugarcane, the best\ndosages for their application ranged from 0.5% to 3% by weight of cement and that\nthe mechanical performance could be improved up to an optimum of about 2% after\nwhich workability was reduced due to fiber clustering.\n\nRocha et al. (2022) noted that the biggest part of natural-fiber reinforcement\nresearch has been done on fibers of lengths between 10 and 40 mm, with 0.5 - 3%\nbeing the dosages used, and all these studies have come to one conclusion crack\nresistance and fracture energy increase even though the paths were very often\nthrough reduced workability and increased water absorption. The natural fibers jute,\nsisal, cotton, and bamboo were used in a blending proportion of about 0.5–1% and\nfor the latter ones the authors Kurpińska et al. (2022) reported that macro strength\nhas risen almost up by 27% and flexural strength has gone up by ±8%. This indicates\nthat the shape and chemical nature of the fiber play a significant role in determining\nthe properties.", "word_count": 436, "start_char": 38637, "end_char": 41396}

Coir and jute-reinforced composites reveal that similar\nenhancement can be achieved by adding low to medium dosage of fiber (Veerappan\net al., 2024). Therefore, it can be said that such treatments along with the use of\nnylon or an equivalent fiber at low to moderate dosages (≈0.5–2%) and fiber lengths\nof 10–30 mm are an effective range for improving post-peak behavior being a\nrational starting point for the design of fiber-reinforced woodcrete, which requires\nmix-specific experimental validation.\n\n2.2.5 Sensitivity in woodcrete manufacturing\nThe manufacturing process of wood-cement composites, also known as woodcrete,\nis extremely sensitive due to the fact that sawdust contains a lot of different organic\nmaterials that may vary greatly in quality and quantity. These variations in the\nchemical composition and compatibility with cement lead to large differences in the\nfinal product. Researches over time have confirmed that wood particles which have\nnot been treated release extractives (such as sugars, resins and lignin derivatives)\nthat slow down the process of cement hydration, thus producing low strength or\ndelayed setting, especially if the most course of sawdust is used (Brahmia et al.,\n2020). One of the main drawbacks to this issue is the necessity for sawdust pretreatment which is very commonly recommended, for instance, alkaline or waterbased extraction, sometimes in combination with chemical admixtures. It has\nbecome a common practice to conduct such pre-treatments for the wood particles\nas it greatly increases the compatibility of the wood with cement, results in higher\ndensity and better mechanical performance Rocho et al., 2021).\n\nThe addition of the pretreated sawdust composites has been reported to be able to\nachieve an increase in compressive strength of up to 50% at moderate levels of\nsawdust substitution compared to the untreated mixes (Sumarno et al., 2023).\nPre-treatment and key manufacturing controls are also very important in\ndetermining the quality of the final product: proper control of the sawdust grading\n(particle size), moisture content measurement and adjustment, following a\nconsistent mixing sequence, and mechanical mixing that is thorough enough to\ndisperse wood particles and any fibers evenly, as well as uniform compaction during\ncasting to ensure repeatability and minimize voids or weak zones, all these are very", "word_count": 427, "start_char": 41280, "end_char": 44055}

If such controls are not respected, the produced woodcrete will have a very\nhigh variability in density, strength and durability, which will result in a great\ndifficulty of coming up with a structurally design that is reproducible. Given such\nsensitivities, it is advisable that every woodcrete mixture undergoes experimental\nvalidation taking into consideration the local sawdust source, pre-treatment and\nmixing.\n\n2.3 Fibre use in construction composite materials.\nNatural fibers including are widely studied as sustainable reinforcement in\ncementitious matrices because they improve post-crack behavior, toughness and\nflexural/tensile response. Although they commonly reduce fresh-workability and\nmay reduce compressive strength above an optimum dosage which necessitates\nmaking the mixes carefully. (Ahmad, 2022).\n\nThese natural fibers such as sisal, coir, jute, flax, banana and hemp have been\nincreasingly explored due to their low cost, biodegradability and ability to improve\nmechanical performance. Each fibre type has unique characteristics influencing its\nsuitability. Coir fibre offers excellent toughness and crack control though it has low\ntensile strength (80–250 MPa) and poor stiffness causing a limit to its structural\ncontribution. Jute and banana fibers show promising initial strength but their rapid\ndegradation in the alkaline cement matrix and high-water absorption can negatively\naffect long-term durability (Balan et al., 2017). Hemp fibre performs better in terms\nof tensile strength (550–900 MPa) but its lower availability and higher processing cost\nmake it less practical in regions like Uganda (Fiore et al., 2015).\n\nSisal-specific studies report mixed results on its performance, many authors observe\nimproved toughness and improved flexural/tensile strength with small additions of\nsisal while compressive strength often increases up to a low–moderate content and\nthen falls as fibre content further increases. Reported optimum ranges for sisal in\ncementitious matrices typically lie between 0.25% and 3.0% (by weight of cement)\nbut values depend strongly on fibre length, treatment and matrix composition.\n(Ahmad, 2022).\n2.3.1 Plastic fiber\nPlastic fiber has emerged as an environmentally friendly reinforcement material in\nconcrete, particularly due to its role in recycling plastic waste such as bottles and\npackaging materials. This helps reduce environmental degradation caused by\nimproper plastic disposal.\nUsing plastic fibers not only promotes sustainable construction but also lowers\noverall construction costs. Research has shown that replacing up to 1.5% of cement\ncontent with plastic fibers provides optimal performance. Additionally, a novel\narrangement involving continuous plastic fiber reinforcement has demonstrated high\nbonding strength between polyethylene terephthalate (PET) fibers and the concrete\nmatrix.", "word_count": 399, "start_char": 44055, "end_char": 46926}

To counter this drawback, additives such as silica fume and metakaolin\ncan be used to improve mechanical performance. Despite the reduction in\ncompressive strength, PET fibers enhance the tensile and flexural strength of\nconcrete, contribute to a more ductile failure mode, and improve the overall\ncohesion of materials within the mix.\n\nIt is also noted that the inclusion of PET fibers may negatively impact the workability\nof fresh concrete and can sometimes lead to spalling. As a result, proper mix design\nand workability adjustments are necessary when plastic fibers are used.\n2.3.2 Natural fibers\nNatural fibers are widely considered promising reinforcements in concrete due to\ntheir lightweight, low cost, environmental friendliness, good specific strength and\nmodulus, and absence of health risks. They are also locally available in many regions.\nCommon types include wheat straw, sugarcane fiber, sisal fiber, jute fiber and\nbamboo fiber.\n2.3.2.1 Wheat straw fiber\nWheat Straw Reinforced Concrete (WSRC) has demonstrated significant benefits at\nearly curing stages, particularly in pavement applications. The inclusion of wheat\nstraw reduced the severity and number of shrinkage cracks. While the slump of the\nconcrete mix decreased, flexural, tensile, and compressive strengths improved.\nAdditionally, the concrete exhibited increased ductility, resulting in ductile failure\nand reduced crack width. The fiber’s sewing effect contributes to better postcracking behavior and absorption capacity. Using wheat straw in concrete also\nreduces crop residue burning and lowers construction costs (Khan et al., 2022).\n2.3.2.2 Sugarcane fiber\nSugarcane fiber enhances the thermal stability and mechanical properties of\nconcrete. When used as sugarcane bagasse ash (SCBA), it increases flexural,\ncompressive, and tensile strength while reducing the thermal conductivity of the\nmix.

Cement matrix with the addition of JTF will have a new\nconcrete of less consistency because of JTF's large surface area which also leads to\nthe mix's harshness. But the hot alkali treatment of jute fibers very much increases\nthe interfacial bond between fibers and cement paste and hence, leads to the\nimprovement of mechanical and durability properties. The reinforcement of JTF\nconcrete gave rise to enhanced compressive, split tensile, and flexural strengths. At\n28 days, the maximum compressive strength was recorded at 2% JTF content, which\nis a 20% rise over control concrete.\n\nHowever, the increase in fiber content has the potential to be detrimental to\nstrength and durability because of reduced flow ability, which necessitates the use\nof super plasticizers at the higher dosages. JTF excels in terms of durability since it\nnot only enhances concrete’s density but also its resistance to water absorption, dry\nshrinkage, and acid attack. But still, only a small number of studies have been\nconducted regarding the long-term durability of JTF-reinforced concrete. There is a\nstrong recommendation for further scientific investigations including the chemical\nand physical treatment of jute fiber and incorporation of pozzolanic materials like\nfly ash or silica fume not only to enhance bonding but also to exert control overall\n(Ahmad et al., 2022).\n\n2.3.2.4 Bamboo fiber\nBamboo has emerged as a green and productive option to steel reinforcement in the\nconstruction of concrete structures. Conventional means of treatment such as boraxboric acid solutions, vertical soak diffusion and pressurized tank preservation have\nbeen successful in giving bamboo an insect attack resistance equal to that of treated\nwood. Advanced techniques and effective waterproof coatings like bitumen, Sikadur\nGel, boric-borax acid and polyester resin have been reported to enhance further the\nbamboo’s durability and bond strength for structural applications in beams and\ncolumns. Additionally, mechanical improvements such as screws placed between\nnodes and hose clamps used as shear connectors have been suggested to increase\nthe bond stress and thus the load-bearing capacity of bamboo-reinforced concrete\n(BRC) elements.", "word_count": 421, "start_char": 48743, "end_char": 51578}

However, the\ndownside is that debonding failure under flexural loads is still an unresolved issue\nthat needs further refinement of the bonding effectiveness (Das et al., 2024).\n2.3.2.5 Sisal fiber\nThe reinforcement of concrete with sisal fiber is not only suitable but also a good\nalternative to conventional steel which is the main reason for environmental and\nhealth issues. With the help of studies, it has been proven that sisal fiber enhances\ncompressive, tensile, and flexural strengths. It is especially useful in drainage plates\nand its cost is about 1.85 times less than steel reinforcement. However, the\n\nintroduction of sisal fiber leads to the reduction of the mix's workability, but an\nincrease in the initial crack load is observed which signifies greater strength. Khan\net al. (2020) found that foamed concrete with sisal reinforcement showed better\nresistance to cracking and stability in dimension. To reduce the negatives such as\nhigh porosity and poor workability methods like alkali soaking, latex coating, or\nperlite blending are usually suggested.\n\nThey not only increase the fiber-matrix bond but also lower the moisture uptake by\nup to 65%, thus allowing the composite to be more stable over time (Mdpi, 2022).\nThe properties of sisal fiber make it suitable for reinforcing woodcrete in overcoming\nthe drawbacks.\nThis natural fiber is biodegradable and is still nowadays used in the traditional ways\nsuch as products made out of ropes, mats, carpets, and baskets. The idea to use it\nas a construction material for reinforcement has recently been attempted. It stands\nout due to its exceptional tensile strength, low price and good bonding with cement.\nThe composition of sisal fiber includes cellulose, lignin and hemicellulose which are\nmainly responsible for the unique properties of the fiber. The fiber is treated with\nalkali to get rid of the surface impurities and this consequently enhances its\ncompatibility with the mix.

Sisal fiber\nis one of the most compatible fibers among them for reinforcing lightweight\n\ncementitious materials like woodcrete. Besides, it has very high tensile strength (350\nto 840 MPa) and good durability in alkaline environments after mild alkali treatment\nand its rough surface texture is responsible for the above property which promotes\nthe mechanical interlocking with the cement matrix (Anas et al., 2022). Its water\nabsorption being moderate is a boon for internal curing since matrix is not weakened\nto a great extent and more effective formation of calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H),\nthe binder responsible for strength development in cement composites, takes place.\nUnlike the fibers that are more brittle or moisture-sensitive, sisal over the years\nmaintains its structural integrity and is also available in East Africa which makes it\na more practical and sustainable reinforcement material option for counteracting\nthe mechanical limitations of woodcrete (Uysal et al., 2024).\n2.3.3 Fiber optimization\nThe optimization of fibre in cementitious composites is a process that needs to be\noptimized according to the performance requirements of the material to be\nproduced, especially the strength enhancement versus workability loss. Overdosing\nof fibre tends to make the composite less flowable and more susceptible to fibre\nclumping, whereas low and moderate amounts of fibers usually increase the strength\nof the composite and its toughness, control of the cracks and behavior after the\npeak load. Ahmad et al. (2022) indicates that the maximum mechanical performance\nof natural fibers is usually found at the dosages of 0.5% to 2% based on cement\nweight, beyond which the workability gets worse and strength improvements are\nless.\n\nThis is also true with the observations mentioned above and taking into account the\nadditional variability brought about by sawdust in woodcrete, it is justifiable to have", "word_count": 366, "start_char": 53707, "end_char": 56096}

Sisal fibers having moderate aspect ratios (AR 60–100)\ngive better performance in terms of crack bridging, tensile strength and ductility,\nbecause of their pull-out resistance and better fibre–matrix bond. On the other hand,\nvery high aspect ratios lead to decreased workability and might result in fibre balling.\nFibers that are employed in the production of cement composites usually have an\naspect ratio of 30–100 which is the range namely optimal for the processes of crack\nbridging and load transfer in brittle matrices.\n\nResearch also points out that natural fibers in cement composites generally can be\nfound with an aspect ratio of 30 to 100 (Fibre Reinforced Cement Composites, 2018).\nThe very same aspect ratio ranges between 40 and 80 have been put forward by the\nindustry as the benchmarks to attain remarkable concrete dispersion alongside\nreinforcement efficiency.\n\nCHAPTER THREE: METHODOLOGY\nThis chapter includes discussion of procedures, material preparation, methods and\nthe various tests followed to meet the specific objectives.\nResearch Design.\nThis shows and informs how this research will be carried out on.\nAfter the submission of the research proposal, intensive literature review continued\nup till the end of the research.

Finding a perfect w/c ratio is a necessary step to the end of\nthe project as it would allow to set the strength requirement without losing ease of\nhandling and placement; thus, a ratio of 0.6 was used in this project.\n3.1.2 Sisal fiber\n3.1.2.1 Fiber Extraction. (ASTM D4151-16)\nMature sisal plant leaves (2-3 years) were harvested at their highest maturity.\nDecortication was performed immediately after cutting as the high moisture content\nof the leaves makes prompt processing absolutely necessary.\nAfterwards, the sisal fibers obtained after decortication and initial washing were\nspread on the ground for natural drying being turned regularly to ensure there was\nno hot spot created by the sun and also protecting them from rainfall and excessive\ndirect sun. Over-drying fibers can lead to gobbling of fungal attack and coloration,\nwhich causes a reduction of their mechanical quality and marketable grade (Diniz,\n2021).\n\nThe fibers were then brushed to remove the remaining pulp, dust and short fibers,\nwhich also aligns the fiber bundles, thus improve smoothness (Barasa et al., 2021).\nThe dried and brushed fibers were graded based on length, color, and cleanliness.\nHigh-grade sisal fiber is usually creamy white to light yellow in appearance and free\nof residual pulp. After grading, the fibers were compressed into bales using simple\nhand-presses and then placed in a dry and well-ventilated storage area (Kawongolo\net al).\n3.1.2.2 Treatment (ASTM D518-15)\nAfter extraction, the sisal fibers were treated. The fiber was cut in very long bundles\nto ensure compatibility with the machine’s maximum gauge length of 500 mm. Pre-\n\nwashing and mechanical removal of coarse pulp improves uniform chemical\npenetration and reduces the volume of alkali consumed. (Bekele et al., 2023).\nThe preparation of 15% NaOH solution was done for the alkali treatment and the\ntreatment was carried out.

This is widely used and reported to improve tenacity and\ninterfacial bonding without obvious cellulose damage.\nDuring immersion, the fibers were gently agitated by manually swirling every 15\nminutes to avoid local concentration pockets and to promote uniform delignification.\nAfter the target immersion time, the alkali was decanted and fibers washed\nrepeatedly with distilled water until the rinse water reached neutral by a pH meter.\nProper rinsing is critical or else residual NaOH will continue to damage fibers and\nimpair end-use performance. Then the fibers were left to dry in shade. (Diniz et al.,\n2021).\n\nThe treatment of sisal fibers was performed following ISO 22157:2019 (natural fiber\npreparation and conditioning procedures). The primary aim of this treatment was to\nget rid of impurities, lessen the content of lignin and hemicellulose and enhance the\nfiber-matrix interfacial bonding for the application of the fibers in lightweight\nconcrete composites. The alkalization treatment was also done to improve the\n\nroughness of the fiber surface and to make it more compatible with the hydrophilic\ncement matrix.\nRequired Equipment\n• Stainless steel alkali-resistant treatment bath\n• Hot plate\n• Bench-mounted fiber comb/defibrator\n• Laboratory glass beakers, stirring rod\n• Digital balance\n1. The extracted fibers were manually cleaned and combed to get rid of the\npulp.\n2. The fibers were then cut into 500 mm bundles.\n3.

The research also reports that\ntreated sisal fibers demonstrate less water uptake and lesser hydrophilicity, which\ntranslates into better dimensional stability and lesser susceptibility to moisture\ndamage in cement composites (Yimer et al., 2023). Consequently, sisal-reinforced\ncomposites possess higher tensile and flexural strength, better crack-bridging\ncapacity, and longer durability than untreated fibre composites, thereby making the\nalkali-treated sisal fibre technically suitable for the reinforcement of woodcrete\nblocks used for structural improvement.\n\nFigure 2: Treatment of sisal fibers\n3.1.3 Saw dust\nThe sawdust was obtained from a reputable sawmill in UIRI in Namanve Industrial\nArea. The material collected was free from contaminants such as bark, resin, or\nchemicals, as these can adversely affect the properties.\nThe collected sawdust was spread in a well-ventilated area under shade to prevent\nexposure to direct sunlight for 24–48 hours, to reduce moisture content.\n\nThe sawdust which was obtained from the milling of Musizi (Maesopsis eminii), a\ncommon hardwood species in Uganda, and other hardwoods too. Generally,\nhardwoods are the most preferred types of wood for sawdust production because of\ntheir lower resin content, higher density, and better dimensional stability over\nsoftwoods. Such properties enhance not only the compatibility of the cement paste\nbut also the segregation of the mixture decreased.\n3.1.3.1 Treatment\nThe saw dust was treated with an alkali, 20% NaOH solution. The sawdust was\nimmersed in it for 2 hours as indicated by research, to achieve the desired chemical\nchanges without compromising the structural integrity of the sawdust (Zulhanif et\nal., 2022).\nThe sawdust was thoroughly washed with distilled water to remove excess NaOH and\ndissolved organic materials. This step is essential to neutralize the alkaline solution\nand to prevent any residual NaOH from affecting the subsequent processing steps.\n3.2 Determining the physical properties sisal fibre in material requirements\nof woodcrete.\n3.2.1 Mechanical testing using the tensomaster machine (ASTM D2256)\nThe mechanical properties of the treated and untreated sisal fibers were evaluated\nusing a Tensomaster universal testing machine, a standard apparatus for tensile\ntesting.

The fibre was put between the upper and lower clamps of the Tensomaster\nUTM.\n5. Special fibre grips were used in the tests to avoid slippage, uneven stress\ndistribution, or fibre damage during the tests.\n6. A unidirectional tensile load was applied at a constant strain rate of 2\nmm/min.\n7. The force was continuously increased till the fibre broke.\n8.
