Following the Great Depression of the 1930s, the United States and the\nUnited\nKingdom.\nInstituted\nfinancial\nregulations\nto\npromote\ncorporate\naccountability. There was a significant shift during the 1950s when finance\nmanagement evolved to become an academic subject with a focus on cost\nmanagement, capital planning, and financing decisions (Kannaiah et al., 2024).\nFinancial efficiency techniques were implemented by Japan during the 1970s that\nshaped international practices. As a result of globalization, European and Asian\nbusinesses began implementing strategic financial planning in the 1980s and 1990s.\nInternational standards now govern financial management, which is essential to the\nlong-term viability and expansion of businesses (Nem, 2023).\nThe 1920s saw a rise in the importance of financial performance in commercial\nOrganizations in the US, as companies used balance sheets and income statements", "word_count": 240, "start_char": 11193, "end_char": 12902}

In order to\nimprove openness following the Wall Street Crash in the 1930s, U.S. and U.K.\nregulators established financial reporting rules. Financial performance indicators\nsuch as Return on Investment (ROI) and Earnings per Share (EPS) gained popularity\nin Western economies in the 1950s. In order to increase operational efficiency and\nimpact global competitiveness, Japan implemented lean financial methods in the\n1970s (Hennig & Romar, 2023). In order to attract international investors, emerging\neconomies like Brazil and India started incorporating financial performance criteria\nby the 1990s. Financial and non-financial metrics are now used to evaluate\nperformance in all major economies.\n1.0.1 Theoretical perspective\nJensen and Meckling's (1976) Agency Theory served as the foundation for this\ninvestigation. The relationship between principals (owners/shareholders) and\nagents (managers) is explained by this theory, which emphasizes the importance of\nfinancial choices and controls in ensuring that managerial decisions reflect the\ninterests of the owners. It is often used to analyze the effects of good financial\ngovernance on the company's profitability, liquidity and value in total. Agency\ntheory is relevant to the topic since it explains how effective financial management\nreduces the conflicts between the management and the shareholders. It stimulates\nresponsibility through the means of budgeting, performance appraisal, and financial\ncontrols.\n1.0.2 Conceptual perspective\nFinancial management is the procedure of strategic planning, organizing, directing,\nand controlling the financial activities of an organization (Sukenti, 2023).

The financial management has two major\nobjectives: share value maximization and ensuring finance continuity. It plays an\nessential role in leading businesses to long-term sustainability, growth, and profit\n(Zopounidis & Lemonakis, 2024). Moreover, sound financial management supports\nrisk mitigation and rational decision making.\nTammy (2024) explains that business organizations are structured groups of people\nwhose main purpose is to carry out professional, commercial, or industrial activities\nwith the goal of either making a profit or performing a specific function. They can\ntake forms such as companies, partnerships, cooperatives, or sole proprietorships,\namongst other structures. Those entities assemble resources like labor, capital, and\ntechnology to produce things or provide services to customers (Davis & DeWitt,\n2021). In a business organization, effective management, clearly-defined objectives,\nand legal registration are the infallible marks of an organization that is ready to\ncontribute to the process of making innovations, creating jobs, and stimulating\neconomic growth.\n1.0.3 Contextual perspective\nFinancial management has a very strong influence on the financial performance of\ncommercial entities in Kenya, particularly as the country moves toward being a\nregional economic hub (Zada et al., 2021). In order to gain a foothold in the market\nand remain in business, the Kenyan corporations are going for the old-fashioned\nmethods of sophisticated financial techniques like opening up a new format of\ninvestment options, intensive cash flow management, and full-scale budgeting\nalong, etc. A lot of organizations were unable to reach the better capital", "word_count": 292, "start_char": 14335, "end_char": 16447}

On the other hand, most\nof the companies have been affected negatively by such problems as lack of financial\nliteracy and failure to adhere to the regulations.\nThe efficiency of financial management system in companies was a major factor that\ndetermined their bottom line in Uganda (Alkaraan et al., 2022). The firms that\npracticed good financial management by hiring more accountants, controlling their\ncash flow, and making proper investments were able to grow and even get more\nthrough selling their products and services. Besides these, in Uganda, the banks'\nfinance and payment services have been supplemented by the vast use of mobile\nmoney platforms such as Mass and Airtel Money so that now firms can better manage\ntheir payments and working capital (Kitimbo, 2021). On the other hand, there are\nstill problems like lack of financial knowledge among the managers, weak internal\ncontrols, and non-uniformity in following the rules. Sometimes these problems may\ncause performance and financial stability issues especially for the small and medium\nenterprises. Nevertheless, financial management is still a driving force of corporate\nperformance in Uganda, as the companies that invest in good financial management\nsystems are usually rewarded with increased operational efficiency and\ncompetitiveness (Ainembabazi, 2022).\nKigezi Pride Bakery is a local bakery based in the Central Division of Kabale\nMunicipality. It was founded to take advantage of the commercial nature of Kabale\nat the regional level by providing the locals with bread and pastry necessities on a\ndaily basis.

The bakery's cash management is compromised by irregular\nrevenue streams and slow payment to suppliers. Profitability is also threatened due\nto weak pricing practices and weak financial forecasting. Even though they have\nbasic financial management structures in place, inefficiencies are also brought about\nby poor training of employees in financial responsibility.\n1.2 Statement of the problem\nStrategic choices like cost control, investment, and expansion are influenced by\nfinancial performance (Molina & Wilestari, 2023). It shows how well-equipped the\ncompany is to pay its debts and keep running. Reliable financial results draw in\ninvestors and boost stakeholder trust. Strong financial performance, including\nconsistent profitability, effective cost control, and positive cash flows, is made\npossible for corporate organizations by effective financial management (Nasimiyu,\n2023). with or without the financial management tool of budgeting, bookkeeping,\nand expense tracking in Kigezi Pride Bakery, the bakery is besieged by financial\nissues. Based on Kigezi Pride Bakery internal Audit report of (2024), sales revenues\ndeclined from UGX 12 million to UGX 8 million monthly last year and operating\nexpenses were up by 15%. Profit margin dropped below 3%, well short of the 10%\nindustry norm. Operations also struggled to make commitments to suppliers within\ntime as a result of cash flow issues. This departure from planned and actual\nperformance is a sign of areas of weakness in financial planning and decision-making.\nIf the trend is not rectified, Kigezi Pride Bakery is likely to fold up and go bankrupt\ndue to heightened financial pressure as well as lose clients' confidence and good\nsuppliers due to sustained delays in payment.

Data that indicates and is related to this research was\ncollected by the researcher from many sources related to it, such as researchers,\njournals, and web pages. It is suspected that these data sources contain secret\ninformation that benefited the researcher in this research.\n2.1 Financial performance\nAs per Diana and Maria (2020), thus, the company's financial performance indicates\nthe extent to which a firm generates revenue and generates a level of profitability\nover time as it optimizes its resources, planning, and assets. In the short and long\nterm, it indicates a firm's health and longevity as a firm. Financial metrics such as\nnet gain, return on equity (ROE), return on assets (ROA), and operating margins are\ngenerally used to measure this achievement. They tend to provide useful information\nabout a firm's efficiency in its management and its firm's financial performance\n(Iacuzzi, 2022). Such data are crucial to the firm's management, investors, and other\nstakeholders to make wise and informed choices.\nAuliyah and Agit (2024) state that a good financial performance is often a result of\nproper financial planning and management alongside efficient execution. Such\ncompanies are also able to withstand an economic downturn, which might otherwise\ncripple their less fortunate competitors, by managing their debts effectively and\neven further investing in the acquisition of new growth opportunities. Poor financial\nperformance, in turn, is a clear signal of bad management, high costs, or low\nrevenues, any of which could plunge the company further into its current financial\nproblems.

Therefore, financial performance is the\nprimary aspect determining the competitiveness and trustworthiness of an\norganization. Financial statement analysis is one of the simplest ways to assess a\ncompany's financial condition (Olayinka, 2022). It implies that the company is\nassessing the impact of its decisions on cash, income, and balance through the\nexamination of cash flow, income, and balance sheet. Through the use of ratios like\nprofit margin, debt-to-equity ratio, and current ratio, one can easily measure his\nperformance against industry norms. Such an analysis enables corporations to\nidentify their strengths, weaknesses, and areas that need improvement. It also\nallows the firm to refresh its strategy in order to be more efficient in its operations\nand thus maximally profit.\nExternal factors like economic trends, governmental restrictions, and market\nconditions can also have an impact on financial performance (Wu & Tham, 2023). To\nput it another way, inflation, changes in interest rates, or shifts in consumer\nbehavior have an impact not only on sales but also on the cost of operations.\nConsequently, external monitoring is as important as internal controls and strategic\nplanning. Organizations must be powerful and versatile in order to keep their\nfinancial results positive even in changing situations. Proactive financial risk\nmanagement enhances sustainability in the long run.\n2.2\nFinancial Management\nFinancial management is the strategic planning, organizing, directing, and\ncontrolling of monetary activities, including the acquisition and usage of cash in an\norganization (Jang, 2024). It involves making major decisions concerning risk\nmanagement, financing, investment, and budgeting in order to assure the financial\nstability and growth of the company.

Moreover, it helps the company\nto maintain a proper mixture of risk, liquidity, and return. A company that is making\nprofits might still suffer from serious financial issues if the management of its\nfinances is not done properly.\nBudgeting, which can be defined as the act of predicting revenues and planning the\nexpenses accordingly for a certain period, is one of the chief functions of financial\nmanagement (Sitinjak et al., 2022). The company views budgeting as a practice that\ncan assist in monitoring its spending and in resource allocation. In addition, it sets a\nstandard for measuring the performance and it empowers the necessary\nadjustments. Financial managers are each department's spending watchdogs through\ntheir budgets. This not only supports inter-departmental cooperation but also instills\na financial discipline culture across the entire company. One of the key aspects of\nfinancial management is the investment decision-making process (Luna-Pereira et\nal., 2022). It is the managers' responsibility to evaluate the risks against the returns\nbefore the funds are committed to either a project or an asset. They often utilize\ntools such as internal rate of return, net present value, and cost-benefit analysis to\nassist them in their decision-making process (Campbell & Brown, 2022). The aim is\nto invest in projects that are congruent with the company's goals and can provide a\ncompetitive edge over the long term. Wise investment decisions are the support of\nfinance and the source of the company’s competitive edge. Financial managers take\npart in one of the most important decisions regarding the company's financing; that\nis, what is the optimal mix of debt and equity for the firm to operate? Moreover,\nthey should monitor the capital structure, which means considering the cost of\nborrowing, interest rates, and the duration of loan repayment.", "word_count": 346, "start_char": 27779, "end_char": 29994}

Financial management of this\nnature leads to a significant increase in profits and efficient operations. Budgeting\ncould then be an essential factor in the timely detection of financial deviations,\nwhich allows for the quick implementation of corrective actions. In this sense, it\nserves as a tool for the maintenance of accountability and financial soundness.\nBesides, budgeting is an instrument that helps to strengthen the company's strategic\nalignment, which indeed is quite a big factor for financial success (Mbogo et al.,\n2021). By turning long-term goals into budget plans that can be acted upon, it\nensures that all the departments are working together. The alignment leads to better\ncooperation and effective resource utilization, which in turn results in improved\noverall performance. Moreover, the departments are made responsible for their\nresults and expenses, thereby nurturing an environment of accountability.\nConsequently, through budgeting, the organization not only gains in terms of\ntransparency but also in productivity across its different units.\n\nAs Okeke et al. (2024) point out, budgeting has the added advantage of improving\nfinancial forecasting and thus businesses can predict revenue and expense trends.\nAccurate forecasting leads to the determination of working capital requirements,\ndebt management as well as investment choices. Companies that do regular planning\nand budget monitoring are more likely to be effective in mitigating risks and adapting\nto the changes in the economy. Quite the contrary, being able to predict future\nfinancial performance has refined the financial resilience and decision-making. In", "word_count": 336, "start_char": 29663, "end_char": 31920}

Dordunu (2023) mentions that budgeting\nindirectly affects financial performance via its influence on employee motivation\nand performance. The employees’ absorption of the information about the financial\ngoals as well as the full employees’ and management participation in the budgeting\nprocess result in upturn of their commitment to the financial objectives\naccomplishment. The limitation of the budget is a source of a department's creativity\nand resourcefulness in reaching their goals. The budget compliance linked with\nperformance assessment further supports the proliferation of a result- based culture.\nThis culture in turn promotes good financial performance over the long term and\nthus sustains the competitive advantage.\n\nPrivate sector businesses utilize budgets to strategize their expansion, manage costs\nof stocks, and determine prices of products (Alsharari, 2021). It helps in building a\nframework for measuring the ROI of different projects. The public sector budgeting,\nbesides, assures that the governmental funds are put to good use and that the\nservices are rendered timely. Budgeting makes it possible for non-profits to function\ncontinuously and to allocate the funds received from the donors prudently. Without\na doubt, budgeting is still the most effective way of measuring financial performance\nacross all industries. Private sector firms apply budgets for their growth strategies,\nstock cost management, and product pricing decision (Alsharari, 2021). It also plays\na vital role in setting up a criterion for project ROI evaluation. In addition to this,\npublic sector budgeting ensures that public resource allocation is efficient and timely\ndelivery of services. Budgeting allows non-profits to survive and to use donor\ncontributions wisely.", "word_count": 336, "start_char": 31506, "end_char": 33816}

In an effort to create value for the organization and achieve its financial\ngoals, it includes planning, directing, controlling, and organizing the operations of\nmoney. According to Wang (2024), good financial management entails having a\nsound risk management, successful resource allocation, and making financial\ndecisions which can ultimately realize the strategic objectives of the organization.\nThe practice of financial management, as a rule, determines the fate of the\nenterprise in terms of profit-making, liquidity, and growth sustenance. It follows\nthat good financial management is a harbinger of financial performance. In two\nmain ways, financial management has a positive impact on the financial success\nof the company, and these are effective cost control and planning (Schubert &\nKirsten, 2021).\nAlthough right investments work in favor of long-term development and setting the\ncompany apart from the competition, wrong ones can drain resources and negatively\nimpact the company's financial soundness. Therefore, effective financial\nmanagement is likely to develop the company's ability to expand and innovate.\nAnother major aspect of financial management is effective working capital\nmanagement, which directly impacts an organization's liquidity and operational\nefficiency (Mazanec, 2022). The constant monitoring of the levels of inventory,\npayables, and receivables ensures that there is enough cash flow in the company to\nmeet its obligations. Through the management of current assets and liabilities,\nfinancial managers aim to achieve the right mix of liquidity and profitability.

The right mix of the debt and equity\nfinancing affects the company's cost of capital as well as its financial risk. Thus, a\nwell-balanced capital structure can create the highest value for the shareholders\nand also cutting the costs of borrowing. Even though the stronger part of equity\nfinancing can change the ownership structure, the strong part of debt financing, on\nthe other hand, could lead to financial risk because of the interest costs. Financial\ncontrol and financial stability are also the results of proper financial management\n(Rachmad, 2025). By identifying, assessing and mitigating financial risks, the top\nexecutives protect the company from possible losses due to fluctuations in the\nmarket, defaults on loans or the operations being inefficient. Effective risk\nmanagement ensures that the resources are not wasted and it also guarantees the\ncontinuity of the business in the adverse conditions. This proactive approach not\nonly raises the organization's financial performance and market reputation but also\nbrings about a general increase in trust among the stakeholders and investors.\nMoreover, according to Shaheen (2023), financial management indirectly becomes a\nkey player in the strategic decision-making that aligns with the company's\nobjectives. Marketing, production, the area of expansion, and the pricing strategies\nare all, to a large extent, dictated by the crucial revelations that financial data and\nanalysis provide.

Taking all these processes together, they\ncontribute to the company’s long-term sustainability, operational effectiveness,\nliquidity, and profitability. Financial management is still the main factor of success\nin a business since companies practicing and giving importance to sound financial\nmanagement techniques are more likely to achieve remarkable financial\nperformance and maintain a competitive advantage in their sectors. Effective cash\nflow management, which is also supported by financial management, is necessary\nfor maintaining liquidity and operational efficiency (Kariuki & Njeru, 2023). When\nthe cash inflows and outflows of an organization are managed effectively, it can\nmeet its short-term obligations without any issues. Moreover, it puts the business in\na position to take advantage of investment opportunities as they come up. Good\ncash flow management mitigates financial stress and reliance on external financing.\n\nCHAPTER THREE: METHODOLOGY\n3.0 Introduction\nResearch strategy used in the studies of the scholar is addressed in the present\nchapter. Research design, target population, sample size, data sources and data\ncollection methods, data analysis, and research process are some of the things that\nare addressed in the present chapter.\n3.1 Research\nTo achieve data collection within regions with little existing information, the crosssectional research design was utilized. Since it enabled data to be collected at a\nsingle moment in time, a cross-sectional research design was utilized in order to\nconduct a survey among the respondents from Kigezi Pride Bakery. Quantitatively\nand qualitatively, both data were collected in order to enable a valid study finding\nand recommendation.\n3.2 Study\nAccording to Mugenda (2011), a population is a whole collection of individuals that\npossess certain observable characteristics. Respondents of 108 persons from Kigezi\nPride Bakery constituted the population of research that was sampled by the\nresearcher.\n3.3 Sample size\nThe size of individual units or participants taken from the general study population\ndefines the sample size (MacCallum et al., 2022). The study consisted of just 85\nrespondents, as per Krejcie and Morgan's 1970 research.

It presents a measure of the level\nof research being carried out. A set of experts will rate the research instrument\nprepared by the researcher. Next, content validity index was determined. According\nto Amin (2015), it is demanded that an instrument must have cumulative average\nindex of 0.70 and above to be authentic.
