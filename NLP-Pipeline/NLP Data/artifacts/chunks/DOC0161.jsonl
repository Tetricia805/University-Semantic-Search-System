For health care,\neducation, and economic development, it is crucial to have access to\naffordable, reliable energy, especially electricity. 790 million people in\ndeveloping nations will not have access to electricity by 2020, and about 2.6\nbillion will cook with harmful fuels. Most of the United Nations 2030\nSustainable Development Goals, which address topics like gender equality\nand climate action, may be achieved by increasing energy availability in the\nleast developed nations and making energy cleaner. By 2030, all people must\nhave access to \"cheap, dependable, sustainable and contemporary energy for\nall,\" including access to electricity and facilities for clean cooking.\nENERGY POVERTY.\nLack of access to modern energy services is known as energy poverty. It refers\nto the condition where a lot of people in poor nations and some individuals\nin rich countries have their well-being badly impacted by extremely low\nenergy usage, the use of dirty or polluting fuels, and a lot of time spent\ngathering fuel to meet their basic needs. Currently, 2.6 billion people employ\nunsafe and ineffective cooking methods, while 759 million people live\nwithout reliable access to power. Although increasing access is only one\ncomponent in efforts to eliminate energy poverty, it is inversely correlated\nwith access to contemporary energy services. Fuel poverty, which largely\nconcentrates on the issue of affordability, is different from energy poverty.\nBrenda Boardman's book Fuel Poverty: From Cold Homes to Affordable", "word_count": 278, "start_char": 9771, "end_char": 11590}

The need to create governmental policies to alleviate energy poverty\nas well as research its causes, symptoms, and social repercussions was sparked\nby the term \"energy poverty,\" which refers to the junction of poverty and\nenergy use. In Boardman's book, when energy poverty was first mentioned, it\nwas defined as not having enough electricity to heat and cool dwellings.\nElectricity poverty is now recognised as the outcome of many systemic\ninjustices that make it difficult for people to obtain modern energy at a\nreasonable cost. Because energy poverty is a private experience within homes,\nis peculiar to cultural contexts, and dynamically changes based on the time\nand place, it is difficult to quantify and, thus, to analyse. The World\nEconomic Forum's Energy Poverty Action programme states that \"Access to\nenergy is essential for raising quality of life and is a vital requirement for\neconomic growth. Energy poverty is still pervasive in the developing world \".\nThis led to the United Nations (UN) launching the Sustainable Energy for\nAll Initiative and declaring 2012 as the International Year for Sustainable\nEnergy for All, which placed a significant emphasis on lowering energy\npoverty. Through Goal 7 of the Sustainable Development Goals, which aims\nto \"provide access to affordable, dependable, sustainable, and modern energy\nfor all,\" the UN further highlights the significance of energy poverty.\nCAUSES OF ENERGY POVERTY.\nEnergy Sources.\nThe majority of emerging nations have significant rural populations, and the\nrural areas in such nations lack a modern energy infrastructure. They have\nrelied primarily on conventional biomass, including wood fuel, charcoal,\ncrop residue, wood pellets, and similar materials. Due to a lack of modern\nenergy infrastructure, including power plants, transmission lines, and\nunderground pipelines to deliver energy resources like natural gas and\npetroleum, which require advanced technologies and have extremely high\nupfront costs and are therefore beyond their capacity in terms of both money", "word_count": 372, "start_char": 11256, "end_char": 13713}

Even while some emerging nations, such as the BRIC bloc,\nhave financial clout and energy-related technical levels that are comparable to\nthose of industrialised nations, conventional biomass still dominates in the\nmajority of developing nations. The International Energy Agency (IEA)\npredicts that while traditional biomass use would decline in many nations, it\nis projected to rise along with population expansion in South Asia and sub-\nSaharan Africa. Renewable energy projects that address energy poverty can\nbe helpful for low-carbon development plans.\nEnergy Ladder.\nAn energy ladder illustrates how energy use has improved as household\nincome has increased. In general, home energy consumption would become\ncleaner and more cost-effective as income rose, such as when switching from\ntraditional biomass to electricity. Low-income and underdeveloped\nhouseholds are prone to use inexpensive, locally accessible, but inefficient\nfuel, placing them at the bottom of the energy food chain. The World Health\nOrganization estimates that over three billion people worldwide are on these\nlower rungs and rely on coal and biomass fuels, such as crop waste, dung,\nwood, and leaves, to supply their energy demands. These people are\ndisproportionately concentrated in Asia and Africa; for example, 95 percent\nof the people in Afghanistan, 95 percent in Chad, 87 percent in Ghana, 82\npercent in India, 80 percent in China, and so on, use these fuels. We would\nanticipate that households would switch to higher quality fuel options as\nwages improve. But it has been a very gradual process. In fact, according to\nthe World Bank, the percentage of biomass used for all forms of energy has\nstayed stable at around 25% since 1975.\nEnergy Prices Increases and Poverty.\nIncreases in energy prices are frequently necessary for economic and\nenvironmental reasons, even though they occasionally make households\npoorer.

This study\nalso discusses the methodological and statistical assumptions and limitations\nthat come into play when estimating the causal effects of energy reforms on\nhousehold poverty. It also explores potential impacts of such reforms on nonfinancial human welfare, which is more challenging to statistically quantify.\nHigh Energy, a study by Oldham. Jules, (2011) Scottish Council for Single\nHomeless, demonstrated how having utilities set up before moving in, being\naware of different payment options and metre types, and being able to access\nthe right tariff to suit their financial needs can make the difference between a\nnew tenancy succeeding or failing when people leave homelessness.\nINTERMEDDLING FACTORS AND DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES.\nDomestic Energy Poverty.\nWhen a household lacks access to or cannot afford to purchase the essential\nenergy or energy services needed to meet daily needs, the situation is referred\nto as domestic energy poverty. These specifications may vary from one\nlocation or country to another. Lighting, culinary energy, and household\nheating or cooling are the most frequent requirements. Other authors take\ninto account a variety of energy requirements, ranging from \"basic energy\nneeds\" related to human survival and highly impoverished conditions. All of\nthe aforementioned activities (cooking, heating, and lighting) , as well as\nenergy for fundamental services related to health, education, and\ncommunications, are referred to as \"basic energy demands,\" which are\nnecessary for achieving basic living standards. \"Energy needs for productive\nuses\" refers to situations where a user also needs the energy to meet basic\nneeds; \"Energy for recreation\" refers to situations where a user has met all of\nthe requirements for the previous categories but still needs energy to enjoy\nlife.

An example of one of these definitions is as follows:\n(a)\n“A person is in 'energy poverty' if they do not have access to at least:\n(a) the equivalent of 35 kg LPG for cooking per capita per year from liquid\nand/or gas fuels or from improved supply of solid fuel sources and improved\n(efficient and clean) cook stoves.and\n(a)\n120kWh of energy per person per year is required for illumination,\naccess to the majority of fundamental services (drinking water,\ncommunication, enhanced health services, improved education services, and\nothers), as well as some value-added to local production.\nAn \"improved energy source\" for cooking is one that requires less than 4\nhours of fuel collection time per week per household, complies with WHO\nair quality recommendations (maximum CO concentration of 30 mg/M3 for\nexposures lasting 24 hours and less than 10 mg/M3 for exposures lasting 8\nhours), and has an overall conversion efficiency of more than 25%.”\nCHALLENGES TO DEFINING AND MEASURING ENERGY\nPOVERTY\nEnergy services cannot be quantified in a tangible way, and there is no agreedupon definition of what constitutes essential energy services, making it\ndifficult to identify and quantify energy poverty. The various ways that\nhumans use energy, such as for lighting, cooking, space heating, and\nrefrigeration, are known as energy services.", "word_count": 259, "start_char": 17814, "end_char": 19441}

The weighted average of the following four variables is\nused to calculate it: \"1) Per capita commercial energy consumption as an\nindicator of the overall economic development of a country; 2) Per capita\nelectricity consumption in the residential sector as a metric of electricity\nreliability and customers' ability to afford it; 3) Share of modern fuels in total\nresidential energy sector consumption to indicate access to modern cooking\nfuels; and 4) Share of population with access to modern energy sources. (The\nHuman Development Index (HDI) served as the inspiration for the EDI.)\nThe EDI gives a metric that provides an understanding of the national level\nof energy development because it is calculated as the average of indicators that\nquantify the quality and quantity of energy services at a national level.\nHowever, this also implies that the EDI is ill-suited to describe energy poverty\nat the home level.\nMultidimensional Energy Poverty Index (MEPI)\nDepending on how severely they are affected by energy shortage, determines\nwhether a person is energy rich or poor. Seven variables are used to classify\ndifferent levels of energy deprivation: \"access to light, contemporary cooking\nfuel, fresh air, refrigeration, recreation, communication, and space cooling.\"\nIf a person goes through a specified amount of energy shortages, they are said\nto be low on energy.\nThe MEPI is computed by averaging the average degree of energy\ndeprivation among the energy poor and multiplying that number by the\nproportion of people who were classified as energy poor relative to the overall\nsample size.

The frequency of\nbuying or collecting a source of energy, the distance travelled from the\nhousehold, the mode of transportation used, the participation of household\nmembers in energy acquisition, the amount of time spent collecting energy\neach week, the household's health, and the participation of children in energy\ncollection are all indicators of energy inconvenience. Lack of enough energy\nto meet essential home demands is referred to as an energy shortage. This\nrating gives more weight to the usability of energy services than to their\naccessibility. The EPI collects data at a micro level, like the MEPI, which aids\nin a better understanding of energy poverty at the household level.\nIntersectional Concerns.\nEnergy poverty, like other challenges of economic justice, frequently makes\nalready poor groups more vulnerable.\nClimate Change\nThe production and use of energy accounted for 70% of greenhouse gas\nemissions in 2018.

In the kitchen, women also spend a lot\nof time cooking. Women who spend a lot of time gathering energy resources\nhave less time for other pursuits, and the physically taxing work causes\nchronic weariness in them. Additionally, women and kids who stay close to\ntheir mothers to assist with household duties run the risk of being exposed\nover time to the indoor air pollution that is brought on by burning traditional\nbiomass fuels. They face health risks from combustion-related substances\nsuch benzene, carbon monoxide, and particulates. This causes a lot of acute\nrespiratory infections in women and children as well as lung cancer, asthma,\nand other illnesses. \"Unsustainable biomass use has devastating effects on\nhuman health. According to the World Health Organization, exposure to\nindoor air pollution is to blame for 4% of the world's disease burden and over\ntwo million extra deaths from cancer, respiratory infections, and lung\nillnesses, mostly affecting women and children.\nIn comparison, each year more people die from biomass pollution-related\ncauses than from tuberculosis (1.6 million) and malaria (1.2 million).\"\nEnergy-poor households are more likely to rely on traditional biomass, like\nwood and cow dung, to meet their energy needs, which is another link\nbetween energy poverty and health. Black carbon is released into the\nenvironment when wood and cow dung are burned, though, because of\nincomplete combustion. A potential health risk is black carbon.\nGender\nEnergy has a huge impact on women and girls' health, educational, and\nemployment chances in underdeveloped nations because they are typically in\ncharge of providing the main source of energy for households.

Because of\ntheir comparatively low incomes compared to the high cost of energy services,\nwomen in industrialised countries are more likely to experience energy\npoverty.\nFor instance, of the 5.6 million French households who were unable to\neffectively heat their houses, 38 percent were headed by women. Because of\nstructural differences between men and women in financial resources and\nability to invest in energy-saving measures, older women are particularly\nvulnerable to experiencing energy poverty.\n\"Energy offers services to fulfil a variety of fundamental human requirements,\nespecially heat, drive (for things like water pumps and transportation), and\nlight. Access to energy services is crucial for the provision of modern business,\nindustry, commerce, and public services like modern healthcare, education,\nand communication. Indeed, many poverty indicators, including infant\nmortality, illiteracy, life expectancy, and total fertility rate, are directly\ncorrelated with the lack of adequate energy services. By encouraging people\nto move into cities in search of better living conditions, inadequate energy\naccess also accelerates urbanisation in developing nations.\nLong-term studies have shown a direct correlation between rising energy use\nand rising living standards.

Because they may be unable to study\nfor as long as they would want without reliable energy sources after sundown,\npupils with limited electrical access may have lower academic standards.\nFurthermore, having reliable access to energy allows female children, who are\ntypically responsible for gathering fuel for their home, to devote more time\nto studying and attending school. In primary schools in sub-Saharan Africa,\n90% of the students are without power. Only 2% of schools in Burundi and\nGuinea and 8% of schools in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR\nCongo) are electrified, respectively (43 percent of whom are under 14 years).\nAccording to these figures, about 30 million kids are attending school\nwithout electricity in the DRC alone. In order to increase human capital,\nwhich in turn helps people become more productive members of society and\ncontribute to economic progress, education is a crucial factor.

However, a rise in money is\nnecessary for access to modern energy services in cities, and this is difficult to\nfind in the economies of many African cities. Due to this, just 25% of Africans\nwho live in metropolitan areas have access to power. Additionally, access to\nelectricity has not grown proportionally as Africa's population has grown.\nDespite a population increase of 150 million individuals between 1970 and\n1990, only 50 million people acquired access to electricity. The greatest\nobstacle to energy access for those living in urban areas is the high price\ncompared to their generally low earnings. The urban poor spend 10–30% of\ntheir income on energy, compared to the non–poor who spend only 5-7%.\nGlobal South\nDue to inadequate energy infrastructure, weak energy service markets, and\ninsufficient family incomes to cover the cost of energy services, the Global\nSouth suffers from a severe lack of access to modern energy sources. The\ncapacity of a region to switch to modern energy sources is influenced by a\ncomplex web of political, economic, and cultural issues, according to recent\nresearch, therefore reducing energy poverty may take more than simply\nimproving power infrastructure. Because better energy availability helps\npeople to employ more of their skills, energy poverty is closely related to many\nsustainable development goals.\nFor instance, having more access to clean energy for cooking helps women's\nhealth by lowering the indoor air pollution caused by burning traditional\nbiomasses; farmers can use telecommunication networks to find better prices\nfor their crops; people have more free time to engage in leisure activities and\nother pursuits, which can increase household income from the time saved\nfrom searching for firewood and other traditional biomasses; etc. Energy\npoverty is generally viewed through the lens of another way to promote\nsustainable development in regions within the Global South because of the\ninfluence energy poverty has on sustainable development.", "word_count": 383, "start_char": 28929, "end_char": 31458}

Between 50 and 125 million people live in fuel\npoverty, according to the European Fuel Poverty and Energy Efficiency\n(EPEE). Fuel poverty shares many complexities with energy poverty, making\nit challenging to describe and quantify. One of the few nations that defines\nfuel poverty as when a household spends 10% or more of its income on\nheating and cooling is the United Kingdom (UK) and Ireland. By employing\nthree indicators checking for leaking roofs, energy bill arrears, the ability to\npay for proper heating, and mould in windows another EPEE investigation\ndiscovered that 1 in 7 families in Europe were on the verge of fuel poverty.\nLow earnings, inadequate insulation in homes, and high energy costs all\nenhance a person's susceptibility to fuel poverty. As weather patterns become\nmore extreme, there is increased pressure from climate change, which raises\nthe need for fuel to heat and cool homes.

An economic\nintervention is a step that a government or international organisation takes in\na market economy to influence the economy in ways other than the usual\nones—regulating fraud, upholding contracts, and offering public goods and\nservices.

State-owned firms that function as\nmarket entities do not constitute an intervention; the term refers to capitalist\nmarket-based economies when government activities interfere with the forces\nof the market through laws, subsidies, and price controls. Mixed economies\nare generally described as capitalist market economies with significant levels\nof state intervention.\nThe Political Standpoint.\nDue to the law of unintended consequences, the conviction that government\nis incapable of successfully managing economic matters, and other factors,\nliberals and other proponents of the free market or laissez-faire economics\ntypically see government interventions as negative. Modern liberals in the\nUnited States and modern social democrats in Europe, however, are more\nlikely to embrace interventionism since they view state economic\ninterventions as a critical strategy for advancing more income equality and\nsocial welfare.

There are several pollution-control laws that apply\nto such particular environmental media as air and water in addition to NEPA.\nThe Clean Air Act (CAA), Clean Water Act (CWA), and Comprehensive\nEnvironmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA),\nsometimes known as Superfund, are the most well-known of these laws. The\nResource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the Toxic Substances\nControl Act (TSCA), the Oil Pollution Prevention Act (OPP), the\nEmergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), and\nthe Pollution Prevention Act are just a few of the numerous other significant\npollution control laws (PPA).

By requiring American automakers to create electric vehicles like\nthe Chevrolet Volt, the government may step in to reduce the country's\nreliance on foreign oil. Jennifer Granholm, the governor of Michigan, stated:\n\"We need help from Congress,\" namely in the form of reauthorizing the tax\nincentives that lower the cost of plug-ins for consumers and the\nmanufacturing tax credit for sustainable energy. Government-mandated\ncarbon fees may be used to advance technology and lower the cost of vehicles\nlike the Volt for consumers. However, according to existing legislation,\ncarbon pricing would only marginally increase the price of gasoline by a few\ncents, which would have little impact on fuel consumption. The White\nHouse has taken credit for putting a down payment on the American battery\nindustry that may lower battery prices in the coming years. Washington is\nstarting to invest in the auto manufacturing industry by partially providing\n$6 billion in battery-related public and private investments since 2008.\nOpponents now hold the opinion that the carbon dioxide emissions tax the\nUS government implemented on new cars is unfair to customers and appears\nto be a revenue-raising fiscal intervention rather than preventing\nenvironmental harm. A national fuel tax ensures that everyone pays the same\namount of tax, with the amount paid by each person or business being based\non the quantity of emissions they produce. They would have to pay more the\nmore they drove. The National Treasury has declared that minibuses and\nmidibuses will be specifically exempt from the emissions tax on cars and light\ncommercial vehicles, which went into effect on September 1, 2010, despite\nthe fact that the motor manufacturers favour this tax.

Although the pace of reliance on biomass fuel is\ndecreasing, this resource will eventually run out due to population expansion,\nputting the environment at even greater risk. Numerous research have looked\ninto the air pollution produced by traditional domestic solid fuel burning for\nspace heating, lighting, and cooking in developing countries during the past\nfew decades. It is already well-established that the indoor burning of solid\nfuels (biomass, coal, etc.) by inefficient, frequently improperly vented\ncombustion equipment causes higher exposure to home air pollutants\nthroughout most of the developing world. This is brought on by the\ncombustion devices' poor combustion efficiency and the high intensity of the\nemissions. Additionally, they are frequently released right into populated\nareas. Typical incomplete combustion products found in smoke from\ntraditional household solid fuel combustion include fine and coarse\nparticulate matter (PM2.5, PM10), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide\n(NO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2), and a number of organic air pollutants (such\nas formaldehyde, 1,3-butadiene, benzene, acetaldehyde, acrolein, phenols,\npyrene, benzopyrene, benzo(a)pyr About 6–20% of the solid fuel used in a\ntypical solid fuel stove is transformed into hazardous pollutants (by mass).\nFactors determining the amount include fuel type and moisture content,\nstove type, and operation, which influence the precise quantity and relative\ncomposition. Although various pollutants can change over time, the majority\nof measurements have been made on carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate\nmatter (PM), the two main byproducts of incomplete combustion and the\nones thought to offer the biggest health hazards. There have been numerous\nreports of indoor PM2.5 exposure levels in the hundreds to thousands of\nmicrograms per cubic metre (g/m3) range. Similarly, it has been determined\nthat CO exposure levels can reach up to 1000 mg/m3 (milligrammes per\ncubic metre).

Women and children\nare exposed to smoke for up to seven hours a day in enclosed spaces as a result\nof the incomplete combustion of solid fuel. These emissions differ with the\namount of airflow inside the house, the season, and the day of the week.\nExposure in substandard housing can be up to 100 times higher than\nacceptable safety standards. One kilogramme of burning wood produces\nsmall soot particles that can block and irritate the bronchial passages since\nmany Kenyan women use a three-stone fire, the worst offender. Aldehydes,\nbenzene, and carbon monoxide are among the hazardous gases present in the\nsmoke. Various diseases have been linked, with varied degrees of evidence, to\nexposure to IAP from the combustion of solid fuels. The two main\nconditions brought on by smoking are chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\n(COPD) and acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI). IAP is also thought\nto contribute to cataracts, blindness, lung cancer, TB, preterm births, and low\nbirth weight.\nWomen and gender\nIn most households, especially in rural areas and in refugee camps, women\nand girls are primarily in charge of gathering wood for cooking. This makes\nthem more susceptible to violent crimes like rape, assault, and beatings that\nresult in physical harm. Improved cookstove initiatives in refugee camps have\ndemonstrated considerable decreases in fuelwood collection times as reported\nby women.

The majority of deaths from household air pollution (HAP), which\nhas been demonstrated to have an impact on close to three billion people\nworldwide, are also women and girls. In Nigeria, it has been demonstrated\nthat using cleaner ethanol stoves instead of conventional kerosene/firewood\nones can reduce the risk of unfavourable pregnancy outcomes due to HAP.\nMITIGATIONS.\nEarly interventions\nUnfortunately, it is difficult and requires constant improvement to find an\neconomical way to handle the multiple consequences of IAP, including\nenhancing combustion, reducing smoke exposure, improving safety and\nsaving labour, reducing fuel costs, and addressing sustainability.\nAlthough the effectiveness of these historical initiatives to improve cook\nstoves to conserve firewood is questionable, they were primarily focused on\nreducing deforestation without regard for IAP beginning in the 1950s. The\nresults of numerous attempts varied. For instance, new stove designs in Kenya\nproduced higher CO2 and SO2 emissions while dramatically reducing\nparticle emissions. Flues to evacuate smoke were delicate and difficult to\nbuild.\nIMPROVED SUCCESS\nSmoke hoods are one of the more effective modern interventions, however\nthey function similarly to flues in extracting smoke and are found to lower\nIAP levels more effectively than residences that only used windows for\nventilation.

An\ninterdisciplinary strategy that involves numerous stakeholders has helped\nwith the installation of interventions, including better cook stoves. These\ninitiatives have found that in order to make sure that intervention\nprogrammes are successful, significant socioeconomic factors must be\naddressed. Numerous intricate problems show that better stoves are more\nthan just a way to save fuel.\nSUCCESSFUL INTERVENTIONS\nThe Kenya Smoke and Health Project (1998–2001), which involved fifty\nrural homes in two different locations, Kajiado and West Kenya, is one\nsuccessful intervention that is represented by the information that follows.\nDue to their various climatic, geographic, and cultural significance, these\nregions were chosen. The main goal of this project was community\nparticipation, and as a result, individuals participated said the outcomes\ngreatly exceeded their expectations. Men were actively involved in the project\nin West Kenya as well as regional women's groups. The project gained wider\nacceptance as a result of including the end users, and it also produced the\nadditional benefit of generating local employment.\nThree major interventions were explored and widely publicised: placing\nsmoke hoods above the cooking area, widening windows, or installing an\nupgraded cook stove like the Upesi stove. Smoke hoods are free-standing\nappliances that pull smoke out of the house by acting like chimneys or flues.\nThey can be used over conventional open flames, and this study found they\nsignificantly reduce IAP levels.

The artisans who were taught by the project as a result received\nadditional employment options.\nPractical Action and East African partners created the clay Upesi stove, which\nis kiln-fired and built of wood and agricultural waste. This stove provided a\nnumber of advantageous qualities because it was created and customised for\nlocal requirements. Not only does it reduce household smoke exposure and\nfuel-wood consumption by about half, but it also uplifts local women by\ngiving them jobs because they make and sell the stoves. As a result of the\nintroduction of this enhanced stove, these women's groups have access to\ntechnical training in production and marketing, experience higher wage\nearnings, and have better social standing.\nNumerous advantages were attained, including better health, which was\ncrucial for everyone of the affected communities. They also reported better\nsleep, fewer headaches and exhaustion, as well as reduced eye discomfort,\ncoughing, and dizziness. The smoke hoods boosted safety by preventing goats\nand kids from falling into the fire, reducing soot contamination, and keeping\nsnakes and rodents out of the house. Windows made it possible to see\nlivestock from inside, and better interior lighting resulted in less of a need for\nkerosene. Overall, a number of small changes that are taken for granted in\ncontemporary western homes considerably improved the indoor\nenvironment. Women can earn more money thanks to increased indoor\nlighting because they can work on their beading near the window when the\nweather prevents them from doing it outside. Increased illumination for\nhomework is advantageous for kids as well. The project led to the\ndevelopment of interpersonal bonds among the women, and men better\nsupported their wives' initiative when the outcome benefited them as well.\nThe awareness that sustainable domestic energy resources are \"essential to\ndecreasing poverty and hunger, improving health...and enhancing the lives of\nwomen and children\" has led to more effective current initiatives to improve\nstoves, notwithstanding the limited success of earlier ones.

It was discovered that the improved stoves put in place as part of\nthe Randomized Exposure Project of Pollution Indoors and Respiratory\nEffects (RESPIRE) study in Guatemala are well-liked by the populace and\nhave a positive impact on mothers' and kids' health. In addition to\nexperiencing less back pain and eye discomfort, mothers in the intervention\ngroup also reported lower blood pressure. Small particles and carbon\nmonoxide levels were also found to be lower in intervention families. Asthma\nprevalence among kids in these homes was also lower. This original pilot\nproject has developed into CRECER (Chronic Respiratory Effects of Early\nChildhood Exposure to Respirable Particulate Matter), which will try to\nfollow kids in intervention households for a longer period of time in order to\nascertain whether the improved stoves also contribute to better health over\nthe lifespan. With some success, India's National Program on Improved\nChulhas has pushed at-risk populations to utilise better stoves. This initiative,\nwhich was started in the middle of the 1980s, offers financial aid to families\nin order to persuade them to buy the more durable chulhas and have a\nchimney put in. According to a 2005 study, women are less likely to get\ncataracts while using stoves with chimneys. There is minimal data from\nintervention trials and most of the information from India is more of a\ncharacterization of the problem.\nWith hundreds of millions of upgraded stoves built since the project's\ninception in the early 1980s, China has been particularly effective at\npromoting their use. By the late 1990s, approximately 75% of poorer, rural\nhomes had \"better kitchens,\" thanks to the government's very deliberate\ntargeting of these communities. A 2007 analysis of 3500 homes revealed that\nintervention homes had improved indoor air quality, as seen by decreased\nlevels of carbon monoxide and tiny particle pollution in the air.

More than 90%\nof the energy demands of rural households in Kenya are met by biomass, with\naround one-third coming in the form of charcoal and the remaining from\nfirewood. Firewood for habitation and charcoal for urban use are two\nexamples of biomass energy mostly derived from savannah woods. A minor\nportion is obtained from nearby communities' closed and protected forests,\nwhich are typically located in regions with dense populations. While it is\nproblematic to gather biomass in sensitive places, it is now known that land\nconversion and agricultural expansion account for the vast bulk of biomass\nclearing. Due to periodic shortages of traditional fuel-wood, about 38% of\nfamilies in \"high agro-ecological zones\" consume agricultural waste. Crop\nresidue and animal waste used for household energy production has a\nnegative impact on soil quality and livestock and agricultural productivity. In\nthe end, these resources are unavailable as organic fertiliser, livestock feed, and\nsoil conditioners, not to mention their \"cumulative implications on national\nfood security\". The majority of farmers are however aware that agricultural\nwaste and dung play a significant role in preserving soil fertility even when\nthey are not burned for energy. Making briquettes is among the most effective\nways to use crop waste and dung for residential energy. The process of\nshaping the material into a doughnut improves combustion efficiency, which\nhelps to reduce emissions. This procedure can be carried out locally and only\nrequires a basic instrument.\nSUSTAINABLE OPTIONS\nOnly when biomass combustion is done sustainably is it possible to burn it\non a large scale.

The most\nsustainable choice would be regenerative cultivars because planting and\ntilling do not disturb the stability of the soil. However, with careful\nmanagement of the forest resources, this could be a workable alternative.\nSome individuals see this solution as a way to further abuse forests. Energy\nefficiency and emissions in the home are two criteria that can be used to\nevaluate fuels and cook burner technology. Even with dirty fuels, highly\neffective stoves can help the environment to some extent (such as firewood\nand biomass). More of the fuel's heating value is converted into usable\ncooking energy with more efficient stoves, so less fuel needs to be produced,\ntransported, and burned to deliver the same amount of cooking, according to\na study comparing the environmental, social, and economic life cycle impacts\nof cooking fuels. Liquid and gas fuels that are burned in highly effective stoves\nare additional sustainable choices. For instance, ethanol generated from\ncellulosic/non-food feedstocks (wood, agricultural waste) has less of an\nimpact on the environment over its whole life cycle than ethanol produced\nfrom materials containing sugar and starch. Even though LPG is generated\nfrom non-renewable fossil fuels, it still has less of an adverse effect on the\nenvironment than traditional fuels; as a result, even while it is not a\nsustainable alternative, it has significantly less of an influence on emissions\nthan conventional fuels.\nCHALLENGES\nSupply\nOn the supply side of the market for cook stoves and fuels, there are tradeoffs between efficiency and sustainability. Although creating cook stoves that\nuse effective and clean fuel sources is ideal from an environmental standpoint,\nthis is frequently not a practical option because of difficulties in expanding\nthe production and consumption of these fuels.

The generation of electricity in India and China, countries that are\nheavily reliant on coal for electricity generation, still causes considerable\nenvironmental problems, and ambient air pollution in communities close to\npower plants continues to constitute a health risk. Additionally, only homes\nin a country or region that are connected to the electric grid will have access\nto electricity for domestic energy consumption, excluding a substantial\nportion of rural populations.\nDemand\nOn the demand side, there are obstacles to establishing an atmosphere that\nmakes buying cook stoves possible. To promote widespread behaviour\nchange, as will be detailed below, culturally sensitive behaviour change\nmethods (BCTs) must be incorporated into demand interventions. The high\nupfront costs of upgraded stoves are the other deterrent to cook stove\nprogrammes that do not include paternalistic good provision. The target endusers of these upgraded technologies are frequently consumers at the bottom\nof the economic pyramid, yet they do not have access to conventional forms\nof consumer finance and credit because they lack collateral or are isolated.\nThese problems are being addressed by new business model innovations and\nthe expansion of microfinance institutions (MFIs), however scaling up\npresents difficulties for MFIs.\nGOVERNMENT INTERVENTION\nThere is a compelling justification for government involvement given the\nnegative externalities connected to unclean cook stove technology, including\nthe harm done to women and girls, the lack of environmental sustainability,\nand the increased risk of diseases like HAP.

Technology advancements have made it possible to employ more\nenvironmentally friendly cooking methods with conventional fuels, such as\nthe BioLite Home Burner, a biomass stove that cuts emissions by up to 95%\nand fuel consumption by 50%.\nSuppliers of cook stoves have also been able to \"dramatically improve both\nmanufacturer and end-user economics, while attaining high levels of health\nand environmental advantages,\" because to innovations in business models.\nFor instance, Rwanda's Inyeneri, a for-profit energy provider, functions more\nlike a \"cooking fuel utility firm.\" Its strategy effectively handles a variety of\nissues with stove adoption, such as the unreasonably high upfront costs of\nstoves, the propensity of consumers to combine new and traditional cooking\nmethods, and the lack of commercial sustainability of these businesses.\nFurthermore, advances in mobile technology have made it possible for\nbusinesses like Pay Go Energy in Kenya and Kopa Gas in Tanzania to get\naround the financial barriers that low-income users experience, such as the\nhigh upfront cost of stoves and the difficulty of buying fuel in tiny quantities\n(a form of the poverty penalty).

This could\nhave a substantial impact on reducing exposure to IAP. One component of\ninfluencing demand that can be accomplished through targeted social\nmarketing efforts is behaviour change. These campaigns often fall into one of\ntwo categories: mass-market campaigns or specialised local and household\napproaches that involve demonstrations and follow-up visits. Studies\ndemonstrate that major marketing campaigns do in fact raise consumer\nknowledge of the dangers of indoor air pollution, but they frequently fail to\nstimulate demand for improved stoves.\nThese factors include intra-gender issues, felt needs, cultural significance of\nfood, and religious and cultural beliefs. When designing these interventions,\nit is important to keep in mind that \"consumer needs and preferences are\ncomplex and are influenced by many contextual and social factors that\nrequire a deep understanding of culture, going beyond technology and\neconomics.\" China, which distributed 172 million upgraded cookstoves\nbetween 1980 and 1995, provided proof of one effective government\ninitiative.

The United Nations Development\nProgramme suggests creating an organisation that will only deal with biomass\nenergy and creating rules for modern biomass, such as cleaner fuels like wind,\nsolar, and small-scale hydropower, as well as sustainable firewood and\ncharcoal. The most practical near-term possibilities, as opposed to a complete\nswitch to nonsolid fuels, are improved cook stoves that use domestic energy\nmore efficiently. Transitioning to contemporary, cleaner fuels and alternative\nenergy sources within a broad international and national policy and\neconomic agenda is the foundation of long-term solutions. As seen by present\nattempts in Zambia to build policy to promote biofuels, government support\nfor long-term solutions is conceivable.\nIn terms of installed solar power systems per person, Kenya is the global top\n(but not the number of watts added). Each year, Kenya sells more than 30,000\ntiny solar panels with a power output of 12 to 30 watts. The PV system may\nbe used to charge a car battery for as low as $100 for the panel and wiring,\nwhich can then supply power to light a fluorescent lamp or a tiny television\nfor a few hours each day. Every year, more Kenyans switch to solar energy\nthan connect to the nation's electrical grid.\nClean cooking Facilities.\nClean fuel can refer to a type of fuel used for cooking and lighting as well as a\ntype of fuel used for transportation. The Sustainable Development Goal 7 is\nto \"Ensure access to cheap, dependable, sustainable and modern energy for\nall\" in reference to cooking. The WHO normative guiding rules for indoor air\nquality include specific fuel recommendations (i.e. against unprocessed coal\nand kerosene) and emission rate targets that define clean fuel.

If\nproperly used and the pellets have low enough levels of moisture, the best-inclass fan gasifier stoves that burn biomass pellets can be categorised as clean\ncooking facilities. However, these stoves are not commonly accessible. As of\n2016, no commonly accessible biomass burner complies with the suggested\nemissions thresholds for usage in indoor households. In addition to\nconventional electric stoves, electricity can be used to power equipment like\nrice cookers and extremely efficient induction burners. Even when connected\nto coal power sources, electric induction stoves are often more\nenvironmentally friendly and less expensive than liquified petroleum gas\n(LPG). 770 million people still lack access to electricity as of 2019, and for\nmany more, it is either unaffordable or unreliable.\nWaste, including human waste and animal manure, is transformed into a\nmethane-rich gas using biogas digesters, which burns cleanly. In regions\nwhere each family has at least two large animals to give dung and a reliable\nsupply of water is also available, biogas systems are a viable technology. Solar\ncookers collect and concentrate the sun's heat when sunshine is available.\nImproved Cooking Stoves.\nImproved cook stoves (ICS) can be used as a stopgap measure on the way to\nclean cooking because they are often more fuel-efficient than conventional\nstoves. Less than 30% of those who use a biomass stove to cook as of 2009 do\nso with an ICS. Because the link between pollution levels and effects on the\nbody has been proven to be non-linear for some illnesses, like childhood\npneumonia, the efficiency advantages of ICS may not always translate into\nconsiderable reductions in health hazards. This implies, for instance, that a\nreduction in exposure of 50% would not result in a halving of the health risk.\nIn terms of blood pressure, shortness of breath, emissions of cancer-causing", "word_count": 397, "start_char": 81056, "end_char": 83615}

Cooking outside, spending less time in the kitchen, keeping the\ndoor open while cooking, avoiding leaning over the fire while preparing\nmeals, staying away while carrying children when cooking, and keeping the\nkids away from the cooking area can all significantly reduce your exposure to\nindoor air pollution (IAP). Changes to the surroundings, such as using a\nchimney, curing fuel wood before use, and using a lid when cooking, can help\nlessen negative effects.

For instance, a recent research in Kenya discovered that households\nthat use LPG as their primary fuel consume 42% more charcoal than those\nthat use charcoal as their primary fuel.

There is proof that converting to LPG and PNG has less\nof an impact on the environment than burning solid fuels, which releases\nmethane and black carbon. Up to 58 percent of the world's black carbon\nemissions come from the burning of household solid fuels. \"The costs of\nestablishing nearly universal access to electricity and clean fuels for cooking\nand heating are anticipated to be between 72 and 95 billion USD per year\nthrough\nwith\nmodest\neffects\non\nGHG\nemissions,\"\nthe\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change noted in 2018. The UN\nSustainable Development Goal 7's first objective is to \"Ensure universal access\nto affordable, dependable, and modern energy services by 2030,\" and one of\nits components is universal access to clean cooking. The achievement of other\nSustainable Development Goals, such as eradicating poverty (Goal 1),\npromoting health and wellbeing (Goal 3), achieving gender equality (Goal 5),\nand acting on climate change, will be made easier by advancements in clean\ncooking (Goal 13). According to SDG 7, Indicator 7.1.2 measures the\n\"Proportion of the population that relies primarily on clean fuels and\ntechnology.\" - The indicator is determined as the proportion of the total\npopulation who report using any type of cooking, heating, or lighting,\ndivided by the number of persons utilising clean fuels and technology.

This can be done by either increasing the\nefficiency with which energy is used (using less energy for a constant service)\nor by decreasing the quantity of service required (for example, by driving less).\nThe idea of eco-sufficiency includes energy conservation. Buildings using\nenergy conservation measures (ECMs) use less energy overall, which\nimproves environmental quality, national security, individual financial\nsecurity, and savings. On the hierarchy of sustainable energy, it is at the top.\nBy avoiding future resource depletion, it also reduces energy expenditures.\nBy minimising waste and losses, enhancing efficiency through technological\nadvancements, and improving operation and maintenance, energy can be\nconserved. The stabilisation of population growth can also help to reduce\nenergy use globally.\nOnly the transformation of energy from one form to another is possible, such\nas the conversion of heat energy into vehicle motive power or the kinetic\nenergy of water flow into electricity in hydroelectric power plants. To change\nenergy from one form to another, however, requires the use of machines.\nWhen this machine is operating, the wear and friction of its parts result in\nsignificant energy losses and substantial associated expenses. By using green\nengineering techniques to lengthen the component life cycles, it is possible to\nreduce these losses.\nSince 1991, December 14 has been designated as National Energy\nConservation Day. The cornerstone of many sustainable energy initiatives is\nenergy efficiency, which refers to using less energy to deliver the same goods", "word_count": 293, "start_char": 87470, "end_char": 89426}

Another strategy is to utilise\nless materials, such as through improved building design and recycling, whose\ncreation consumes a lot of energy. Another option to save energy is to make\nbehavioural adjustments like switching to videoconferencing instead of\nbusiness travel or travelling inside cities on foot, bicycle, or public\ntransportation rather than by car. Building codes, performance criteria,\ncarbon pricing, and the creation of energy-efficient infrastructure are a few\nexamples of government policies that can be used to increase efficiency. An\napproximation of the energy efficiency of economic output is provided by\nthe global economy's energy intensity, or the amount of energy spent per unit\nof gross domestic product (GDP). Per US dollar of GDP in 2010, there were\n5.6 megajoules (1.6 kWh) of global energy intensity. According to UN\ntargets, between 2010 and 2030, energy intensity should drop by 2.6 percent\nyear. This objective hasn't been reached recently. For instance, only 1.1% of\nenergy intensity was lost between 2017 and 2018. Efficiency gains can have\nthe unintended consequence of making consumers spend their money on\nmore energy-intensive goods and services. For instance, consumer behaviour\npatterns like choosing larger vehicles and residences have largely countered\nrecent technical efficiency increases in transportation and construction.\nENERGY CONSERVATION OPPORTUNITIES BY SECTOR\nBuildings\nExisting buildings\nConducting an energy audit is one of the key approaches to increase energy\nsaving in buildings.

Homeowners may now perform somewhat complex energy\naudits on their own thanks to recent developments in smartphone apps.\nEnergy consumers, both commercial and residential, can see the effects of\ntheir energy use in their workplaces or homes thanks to building technologies\nand smart metres. Modern real-time energy metering can support individuals\nin their efforts to save energy.\nEnergy Service Companies (ESCOs) with expertise in energy performance\ncontracting are frequently used by companies installing ECMs in their\ncommercial buildings. Since the 1970s, this industry has existed and is now\nmore widespread than ever. A set of rules have been developed by the USbased group EVO (Efficiency Valuation Organization) for ESCOs to follow\nwhen assessing the savings realised by ECMs. The International Performance\nMeasurement and Verification Protocol is the name of these rules (IPMVP).\nIn order to provide a more thorough awareness of the environment,\ndataloggers can also be added to precisely track the interior temperature and\nhumidity levels. More fine-tuning of the interiors can be undertaken if the\ndata collected is then compared with the users' impressions of comfort (for\nexample, in increasing the temperature where AC is used to prevent overcooling).\nNew buildings\nWhen a structure is designed with passive solar principles, its windows, walls,\nand floors are constructed to absorb, store, and distribute solar energy as heat\nin the winter and reject it in the summer.

The\neasiest buildings to use passive solar design approaches are those that are\nnewly constructed, however older structures can be modified.\nTransportation\nIn the United States, suburban infrastructure developed at a time when fossil\nfuels were readily accessible, which resulted in living arrangements that are\nreliant on mobility. Zoning changes that permit higher urban densities, along\nwith plans for walking and bicycling, can significantly lower the amount of\nenergy used for transportation. Since many Americans don't commute to\nwork every day, there is a tremendous chance to save energy by working\nremotely.\nA decrease in greenhouse gas emissions is one of the environmental effects.\nMadrid's city centre saw a 38 percent decrease in nitrogen oxide levels and a\n14.2 percent decrease in carbon dioxide after restricting access for cars.
