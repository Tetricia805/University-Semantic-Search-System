Most of the youth have limited access to livelihood means,\nespecially capital (credit) and employment. The Youth Livelihood Assessment Report,\n(2016) indicated that, in 2013, 13.3 percent of employable youths had not been\nemployed and which, was projected to increase to about 18.6 percent by 2015. The\nlargest share of the unemployed youths are women at 22.4 percent and males take a\nportion of 14 percent. With an annual average population growth rate of 3.2% (13\nmillion people), the youth population was anticipated to rise to about 7.7 million\nyouths by 2015. This increase in youth unemployment and low participation comes at\na time when Uganda and the world at large have put in place strategies and polices\nfor youth livelihoods.\nIn order to mitigate poverty among the youths, the government in partnership with\nother private actors (NGOs), have occasionally rolled out funds to various youth\ngroups. For instance, quality Education for All (EFA), Northern Uganda Social Action\nFund (NUSAF2), Skilling Uganda, Youth Enterprise Scheme and Youth Venture Capital\nFund and above all, the Youth Livelihood Programme in particular. The highlighted\ngovernment and private partnership interventions in here, are put in place with a\nprime intent of providing easy access to credit (funds) for self-development.

For example the Youth\nLivelihood Program (YLP), Women Empowerment Program (WEP) among others has\nbeen rolled out by government by exclusively the Sacco member’s expectation. Most\nof the funds have failed to achieve the intended of goal of alleviating individuals’\nlivelihoods (New Vision, November 05, 2017). Despite organizing people into groups,\nthe arrangement has failed to stir up the required momentum of improving livelihoods\nin Uganda. There have been several interventions to enhance livelihood levels but the\nhousehold survey report still indicated that the failure rate problem is escalating to\nan unimaginable degree.\nThe disintegration rate of the groups is very high and rampant simply because, the\nSacco has seemingly transitioned into another form of “subsistence living”. This\nespecially in such a way that, people access financial credit in order to consume, that\nis to say, the saved money is preserved to cater for the postponed expenditure such as\non fees, buying food, festive costs among others and the cycle continues year after\nyear. The groups have failed to refund the money due to mismanagement, corruption\nand abuse of the disbursement process. This makes the fund recovery and collection\nproblematic and thus, engineering the subsequent failure of the YLP.\nDespite the above identified gap, most developing partners like NGOs and government\nprograms are still persisting on employing the same methodology.

The financial disbursement and management\ndiscrepancies within the Sacco members expectation have compromised the system\nand this requires urgent attention (Mumbua, 2015).\nConsiderable evidence clearly shows that whenever the funds fail to achieve the\nintended objectives in regard to livelihood performance levels, it is simply\ntransformed into another with a different name and new objectives (Bimenyi, 2017).\nRegardless of the failures, the group approach seems to be the best methodology of\nenhancing livelihood performance levels but our research seeks address the financial\ndisbursement and management gaps within this kind of structure so that, it can\ndeliver results in alignment with the intended expectations and goals.\n\n1.2 The Problem Statement\n\nThe Ugandan government's Youth Livelihood Programme (YLP) represents a wellintentioned but so far ineffective attempt to address the pressing challenge of youth\nunemployment and financial insecurity. The program's ambitious goals have been\nundercut by rampant financial mismanagement and abuse within participating youth\ngroups, calling the entire Sacco model into question. Despite ongoing efforts,\nmanagement of member expectations has been very low, evidenced by high default\n\nrates, corruption, and the inability of youth groups to implement viable income\ngenerating activities (Atega, 2022; Auditor General, 2018). Therefore, this study aims\nto investigate financial disbursement and management of member expectations in YLP\nyouth groups.\nYouth unemployment is a pivotal development challenge in Uganda, with the youth\nbulge representing both promise and peril for the country's future (Shepler, 2017). The\nYLP was the government's attempt to provide skills, startup capital, and loans to\nyouth groups aged 18-30 to engage in joint enterprise. Launched in 2013, over 230,000\nyouth in 10,000 groups had participated by 2017 (YLP Brief, 2017).", "word_count": 365, "start_char": 10723, "end_char": 13284}

Rigorous\nevaluations show negligible impacts on earnings or employment for youth versus\nnonparticipants (Blattman et al., 2016). Default rates approach 50%, and\ninvestigations reveal groups unable to implement income generating activities or\naccount for funds (Auditor General, 2018). Financial mismanagement like ghost\ngroups, embezzlement, and corruption are widespread, undermining the Sacco model\n(Bukenya et al., 2016; Wofana 2018). Reforming financial training, monitoring, and\naccountability mechanisms is urgently needed if the YLP is to benefit youth rather\nthan fall victim to mismanagement. This study aims to uncover factors driving\nfinancial abuse and propose interventions to strengthen financial management in\nyouth groups.\n\n1.3 Purpose of the Study\n\nThe research’s main purpose is to investigate how financial disbursement abuses and\nmanagement loopholes can challenge the success of the Sacco member’s expectation.\nIn so doing, the project is deemed to postulate appropriate financial disbursement\nand management measures that will help government and the private partners (NGOS)\nto streamline the success rate of the Sacco member’s expectation. Therefore, the\nprime purpose in simple comprehension is to front the centrality of the financial\ndisbursement and management as pivotal pillars upon which the extent of\nachievement of the group based intervention resonates.\n1.4 Specific Objectives\n1.

The\nresearch will capitalise on the largest parishes within Mukono Municipality as a case\ngroup. Therefore, the geographical scope of the research will be a case study focused\none, with a particular geographical focus on Mukono Municipality.\n1.6.2 Content Scope\nThe study will be generally confined to the field of Finance, with a particular focus on\nfinancial disbursement and management components. Similarly, the content will also\n\nconstitute the Youth Livelihood Program (YLP) which edifies the Sacco member’s\nexpectation as employed by the government and private partners (NGOs). Thus, the\nsuccess rate of the group-based interventions will be the project’s dependent variable\nand the financial disbursement and management factors will be the\nindependent/explanatory variables.\n1.6.3 Time Scope\n\nThe study shall assess the financial disbursement and management related constraints\nlimiting the scale of achievement of the Sacco member’s expectation, especially the\nYouth Livelihood Program in Mukono Municipality in the previous financial year\n2023/24.

The inevitable necessity of financial disbursement and\nmanagement in determining the success rate of the Sacco member’s expectation and\nthe YLP in particular, strongly justifies the paramount need for research about the\nproblem.\n\nThe research will be undertaken to also provide a deeper understanding of the central\nrole of the financial disbursement and management pillars, including their influence\non the success level of the Sacco member’s expectation and how best the two aspects\ncan be deployed in guiding livelihood expectations especially the YLP, as well as other\ngroup based interventions in the country.\n1.8 Significance\nThis research will help government to understand the challenges on the aspects of\nfield\nfinancial disbursement and management upon which the group based approach or\ninterventions access the funds in order to achieve the anticipated results.\nThe research will also help the government and NGOs to adopt better financial\npolicies that will enable the Sacco member’s expectation to solve the financial\nissuance and management and deliver according to the predefined objectives.\nIt will also help the government to redefine the modality and trajectory by which\nfunds are channeled from the central authorities to the intended groups with great\nability to recover them and unify different individuals’ objectives into a common focal\npoint of livelihood alleviation.\n1.9 Theoretical Framework\nThe Sacco theory is a popular approach commonly employed in improving the lives of\nthe people living in poverty.

Several\ndeveloping nations have initiated and scaled up Sacco livelihoods programs as the best\napproach in practice, which is geared towards guiding the government interventions.\nTherefore, the increasing popularization of, the theory Sacco theory irrespective of its\nlimited achievements especially in Uganda, is still the only way to go in livelihood\nalleviation interventions by the government. Policy makers and practitioners have\ninsisted on using the same approach time and again despite its failure to deliver as\noriginally intended results. It is therefore, on the basis of this practical gap in the\nSacco theory that our research revolves to launch its investigation. Hence, the\nresearch is essentially a preoccupation of addressing the gap as to why the group\nbased\nintervention approach has failed to deliver as projected.\n\nTHE LITERATURE REVIEW\n2.0 Introduction\nThe consistent use of Sacco by the government to enhance livelihoods in Uganda has\nyielded very less results than originally intended. This literature review seeks to find\nanswers to our research gap, that is, why are the financial issuance and management\nrelated problems hindering majority of the Sacco livelihood interventions from\ndelivering the required results? As well as identifying the research gaps there in,\nespecially in the manner in which, the groups deal with the funds provided to them.\nThis will be done by examining the arguments for the use of Sacco x cmember’s\nexpectation and the reasons as to why the approach may not be an appropriate one\nfor handling the funds and unfit to engineer the enhancement of livelihood levels in\nUganda. This implies that, our literature review will mainly focus on the Sacco\nmembers expectation and will be limited to the Youth Livelihood on Program (YLP).\n2.1 Evidence for the use of Sacco members expectation Approach\n\nAccording to (Narayan, D. (2005). Measuring empowerment: Cross-disciplinary\nperspectives. World Bank Publications.), the Sacco approach is still widely recognized\nas a mechanism that offers the most comprehensive framework for understanding how\npeople live. This is partly because, the Sacco approach is firmly rooted in a\nperspective on development and hence, this explains its wider and rigorous use by\ndeveloping countries like Uganda especially on account of its capability to deliver the", "word_count": 407, "start_char": 19160, "end_char": 21859}

That is, the approach is a welldesigned and sophisticated framework for alleviation of livelihoods.\nIn his view, Scoones (2018) suggests that, the Sacco livelihood approach is mainly\npreoccupied with wanting to understand how different people in different places and\nhow and why people make the choices that they do. This rejects the idea that\npeople’s wellbeing can be understood based solely on a simple technical or financial\nanalysis of the sectors in which people earn their living, or that this would. And thus,\nthe approach would be an adequate basis for developing policy or interventions to\nsupport livelihood interventions. That is to mean, the approach is considered the best\nbecause it is essentially an actor-oriented perspective. Typical group-based livelihoods\npromotion and support programs include interventions for income generation and\ndiversification by providing access to human, social, financial and physical capital.\nThis is done through group savings and credit, financial linkages, training for\nproductivity. (Wong and Guggenheim 2018).\n2.2 Critiques on the Sacco members expectation Approach\n\nSacco Livelihoods approach often does too little because it tries to do too much (Carr,\n2013). This is because, it sets out to describe the vulnerability context and the\npolicies, institutions and processes that shape livelihoods, and inevitably ends up as\ntoo superficial mechanism to explain how those factors have shaped the livelihoods of\ndifferent people. It could be said that they have focused on describing the boxes in\n\nthe diagram instead of explaining the arrows. That is, the approach tends to dwell on\nthe secondary issues and ignores the core or primary essentials of the interventions.", "word_count": 305, "start_char": 21626, "end_char": 23630}

First, group based\nlivelihood objectives are rarely explicitly researched. Neither development projects\nnor\nhumanitarian assistance are usually based upon finding out what these are or\ndocumenting them. Secondly, since objectives vary across the population, there are\nmethodological difficulties in generating general and generalizable findings.\nObjectives cannot easily be understood through the centralized goal and objectives of\nthe\ninterventions.\nDespite growing investments in Sacco livelihoods promotion, there is little consensus\non how impactful these programs have been, and why or why not (Mansuri and Rao\n2004; Banerjee et al. 2015c). Other critics purport, that Sacco members expectation\nprograms are not inclusive in their outlook and have a very poor accounting capacity.\nAnd this explains why the interventions by Sacco are prone to financial discrepancies\nlike corruption and embezzlement.\nFurthermore, there are very few studies that have attempted to examine the quality\nof participation in groups and weakens the program design (Duvendack, 2015). If there\nis special attention given, it will help policy makers to adopt and incorporate best\n\npractices suitable for group formation. Thus, there is clear need for more high quality\nimpact evaluations and systematic reviews of the group based approach.\n2.3 Scale of Achievements of the Sacco Youth Likelihood Programme Approach\n\nThere is vivid evidence that, the Sacco co approach has very limited scale of\nachievement. This is mainly amplified by notable bottlenecks like; corruption, lack of\nenough training, presence of ghost groups, lack of equity, lack of common\nunderstanding and low supervision of groups by technocrats among others. This\nimplies that, despite the program (YLP) being a good initiative, there is need for\napproach review or redesigning the Sacco approach. That is, some policy analysts\nsuggest that, the government should abandon the Sacco approach and instead, adopt\nthe individual Sacco o approach (Atega, 2022).\n\nSome research reports indicate that, The Sacco YLP intervention initiative had no\nstatistically significant effects on the livelihood performance levels of youths in\nUganda as compared to the control group (Bukenya et al, 2019). The measures of\ndirect income showed that, youths in the intervention groups lagged behind as\ncompared to their counterparts in the control group. Thus, the individual Sacco\napproach would be much better than the group Sacco one simply because, that groups\nare leading to defaulters unlike the individual approach that ensures easy monitoring\nand follow-up during debt recovery.", "word_count": 449, "start_char": 23391, "end_char": 26389}

This is mainly premised\non a researched fact that, it would be very efficient in dealing with people in clusters\nother than individually especially in terms of costs of administration, facilitation and\nmonitoring. The general financial distribution and management are easily\nmanageable.\nAccording to the evidence above, the group Sacco approach is not the problem in\nitself, rather the financial disbursement and management is the major challenge.\nThat is, the main challenge seems to lie in the managerial aspect especially through\nthe poor monitoring system by the government technocrats. Therefore, the\ngovernment pays\nless attention on the monitoring and supervision of the groups, which results into\nsevere systemic bottle necks that hinder the approach.\nThe available literature does not provide other options with which the group Sacco\napproach can be substituted. That is, the literature does not endeavor to provide\nother possible alternatives that can be adopted by government in order to realize the\nintended results of the interventions. This shows that there is still limited research on\nthe methods to be employed in the execution of livelihood interventions. Therefore,\nthere is need to either improve on the already existing one (group Sacco approach) or\nfind/formulate another method or approach that is result oriented.\n\nThe group Sacco approach has inadequate impact evaluations to examine the impact\nof group-based livelihoods interventions on diversification of income, indebtedness,\nsource of loans and social cohesion outcomes. However, these have not yet been\nsynthesized, representing a synthesis gap. Consumption, vulnerability and poverty\nlevels have each been synthesized by one systematic review, but these were assessed\nas having low confidence. Hence, this is yet another absolute gap, rather than a\nsynthesis gap.", "word_count": 371, "start_char": 26011, "end_char": 28497}

Despite the fact that, a few\nreports have been written by Ministry of Gender Labor Social Development (MGLSD).\nThese have been mainly focused on the progressive analysis attempting to show the\nscale of the project implementation. This clearly explains why most of the available\nliterature about YLP focuses on scope of project implementation but ignore the\nmethod employed in financial disbursement and management pillars (group Sacco )\nbecause is the major determinant factor of the extent of achievement of the\nprojected objectives.\nTherefore, the major underlying gap in the Sacco as presented by the above\nliterature, is mainly the challenge of inadequate research in the area of financial\nchanneling and management by the intended groups. This is particularly in terms of\n\nhow the groups can access, use and repay the funds in alignment with the goals and\nobjectives of the intervention. The unification of the individual goals into a common\ngoal and objective has been a persistent challenge that has characterized the Sacco.\nThis explains why these groups sharply disintegrate and this is due to the\ncontradicting interests, goals and objectives of all members that ruin the viability\npotentials of the Sacco members expectation.\n2.6 Conclusion\nThe Sacco members expectation has got tremendous potentials of streamlining the\nlivelihood interventions to their anticipated achievements only and only if, the\ngovernment and NGOs can pay more attention on researching about the most\nappropriate financial issuance and management structure. That is to mean, the Sacco\nmembers expectation is perfectly designed on paper but speculative in delivery and\nthus, offers a very limited pragmatic sense. Therefore, the group-based approach is a\ncheap and user-friendly mechanism by developing economies since it tends to tackle\nthe challenges from the grassroots (at the community level) but, requires more\nresearch on the self-propelled and easily auditable financial channeling and\nmanagement mechanisms.", "word_count": 380, "start_char": 28202, "end_char": 30726}

It\nwill essentially comprise of the research design, overview of the research problem,\ntarget population, sample size, data sources data collection, procedure for data\ncollection and analysis method. It also includes ethical considerations plus the\nstrengths and limitations of the research.\n3.1 The Research Design\nThis study employs the case study design in which we shall seek to focus a particular\nlivelihood intervention (YLP) of that are specifically within Mukono Municipality. This\nis intended to provide us with an in-depth answer to the problem statement, that is,\nhow best can the Government and NGOs address the financial disbursement abuses\nand mismanagement components in the group based livelihood interventions\nespecially the YLP in particular? Thus, in order to generate reliable data set for the\nstudy, the research shall employ a mixed method that will combine both qualitative\nand quantitative research approaches. This focus on the particular intervention group,\nwhich will be obtained using the purposive sampling technique in Mukono Municipality\nof Mukono\ndistrict.\n\n3.2 Target population\nThe study population shall comprise of legitimately registered and actively involved\nyouths in the Youth Livelihood Program (YLP) of Mukono Municipality in Mukono\ndistrict.\nThe eligibility criterion for the study shall be based on the, population with the\nspecified description. The eligibility criterion is discussed in detail as below.\n\n3.4 Population and Sampling Technique\nThe YLP groups that are situated within Mukono Municipality will constitute the target\npopulation. That is, the study population will include all the youths in the YLP. The\nresearch will employ the simple random sampling technique by which the sample\npopulation will be attained. The members in the YLP groups will be assigned random\nnumbers and those with even numbers will be considered or included in the\npopulation sample.\n3.5 Sample size\nThe sample size for the study shall be obtained using Slovene’s formula. That is, we\nshall specifically work at 95% level of confidence, 5% confidence interval and 0.05\nmargin of error to obtain the required sample size of the study. Assuming that, our\npopulation size was to be approximately 250 members, then our sample size will be\nobtained as below; n =N/ (1 + Ne2) n = 250/ (1+250*0.052) n = 250/ 1.625 n = 154\nrespondents.", "word_count": 426, "start_char": 30425, "end_char": 33210}

In this particular study, the\nFinancial Disbursement and management will be the independent variables whereas\nthe rate of success of the YLP intervention will be the dependent variable.\n3.7 Information/Data Sources\n\nThe research’s data sources will explicitly include both primary (firsthand information\nfrom respondents) and secondary data or data from already conducted research\nprojects and accredited research firms/bureaus in Uganda.\n3.7.1 Primary data\nPrimary data will be obtained from respondents using semi-structured face to face\ninterview through an exclusively physical interaction with the respondents.\n3.7.2 Secondary data\nSecondary data on the youth livelihood program will be obtained from different\nreports including\nUganda youth livelihood programs, Ministry of Labor Gender and Social Development,\nUBOS and Uganda Household Survey Report.\n\n3.8 Procedure for Data Collection\nWe shall employ the mixed method case study under which we shall use interviews to\nobtain both qualitative and quantitative data.\n3.8.1 Data Collection Tool\nWe shall use a designed semi-structured interview, which will constitute both\nqualitative and quantitative questions in nature and with strict alignment to the\nresearch gap/problem. We shall interview group (A) members of YLP in Mukono\nCentral Division.\n3.8.2 Quality/Error Control\nThe study will pay critical attention on the obtained responses from the field and\nfilter out the mismatches in the responses. The questionnaires will be reviewed and\nnecessary measures to streamline responses to the main objective will be done. Thus,\nwe shall use 95% as our study’s confidence level to cater for the idiosyncratic errors in\nthe research.\n3.9 Interview schedules\nThis will involve the time period interaction between the researcher and the\nrespondents (personal interview) on a face-to-face arrangement. The interview\nsessions will be conducted on the timely basis of one respondent after the other.\nTherefore, we shall use open ended questions to obtain the responses by use of an\ninterview template and a recorder to enable us capture all the interviewees’\nresponses accordingly.\n\n3.10 Strategy for Data Processing and Analysis", "word_count": 390, "start_char": 33017, "end_char": 35647}

This shall include; exploring common themes through the use of the\nobtained qualitative data as especially by highlighting significant responses from the\ninterviewed respondents. Using content analysis, qualitative data shall be analyzed\nbased on the field feedback on the subject matter. Through the quantitative analysis,\nthe study shall use unvaried analysis technique to interpret the obtained data. This is\nmainly because, the adopted research design (case study design) is largely\ndescriptive, simply because it seeks to discover the in-depth understanding of the\nproblem.\nTherefore, our data analysis will address the research questions depending on the\nevidence collected from the field. It will be done through examining, categorizing,\ntabulating, recombining both qualitative and quantitative pieces of evidences to\naddress the initial proposition of the study. Data analysis will start will finally involve\ntranscribing and translating interview records followed by coding, and then by\ncategorization. That is, the data will be categorized into different themes according\nto the research objectives. Thereafter, the analysis and discussion will then be done\nby interlinking evidence from the primary sources and secondary sources through\nexamining and comparing with each other in relation to the research questions.\n\n3.11 Ethical Considerations Anticipated Methodological Constraints\n\nThe research process shall be guided with the strict observance of the ethical\nprinciples of academic research and rigour especially by obtaining a clearance letter\nfrom the university faculty to go to the field and conduct the interviews.

The data collected from the interviews will be presented, analyzed, and\ninterpreted in relation to the research objectives and questions. The qualitative and\nquantitative data will be presented separately to provide a comprehensive\nunderstanding of the research findings.\n4.1 Presentation and Analysis of Qualitative Data\nOverview\nThis chapter focuses on presenting, analyzing and interpreting the data collected\nduring\nthe research study on the challenges faced by Sacco members in accessing and\nmanaging funds. The data was gathered through interviews with Sacco members. Two\nkey themes emerged from the qualitative interview data: 1) Financial Disbursement\nChallenges, and 2) Financial Management Issues.\nRegarding financial disbursement challenges, participants highlighted issues like lack\nof transparency in fund allocation, delays in disbursement, and limited access to\nfinancial information from the Sacco. For financial management issues, participants\nraised concerns about accountability, mismanagement, and corruption within the\nSacco groups. There were issues noted around misuse of funds and lack of proper\nfinancial records.\nThe presentation will involve summarizing the interview data through illustrative\nquotations and observational descriptions. The analysis will code and categorize the\n\ndata into coherent themes. The interpretation will synthesize the findings to provide\nbroader meaning related to the research objectives on understanding Sacco members'\nfinancial access and management challenges. Overall, this chapter elucidates the key\nresearch findings on the stated problems faced by members of the studied Sacco.\n\n4.2 Presentation of Qualitative Data\nThe qualitative data gathered from open-ended interview questions and observations\nwill be presented thematically. Quotations from participant interviews will be used\nwhere relevant to provide descriptive evidence for the identified themes. For\nconfidentiality, pseudonyms will replace participant names. Observations from the\nfield will be summarized to highlight pertinent points. Overall, the qualitative data\npresentation will aim to provide rich, detailed accounts of participant experiences\nand researcher observations.\n4.3 Analysis of Qualitative Data\nQualitative data analysis will involve thoroughly reviewing interview transcripts,\nobservational notes and documents to identify and code key themes and patterns that\nemerge. Thematic analysis will be utilized to categorize codes into coherent themes\nthat capture important concepts within the data. These themes will be analyzed and\ninterpreted in relation to the research objectives and questions. Careful attention will\nbe given to identifying divergent perspectives and outlier data that contradict\ndominant themes.", "word_count": 429, "start_char": 38868, "end_char": 41979}

Tables will clearly\nsummarize results from closed-ended survey questions. Statistics such as frequencies,\nmeans and standard deviations will be reported where applicable. Charts and graphs\nincluding bar charts, pie charts and scatterplots will be used to visualize key\nquantitative results. Overall, the quantitative data presentation will aim to\nsummarize numerical findings in a clear and efficient manner.\n4.5 Analysis of Quantitative Data\nQuantitative data analysis will involve conducting statistical tests and procedures on\nthe collected numerical data. Analysis approaches will include examining frequency\ndistributions, calculating descriptive statistics, and testing hypotheses using\ninferential statistics. Statistical software will be utilized to efficiently organize,\nanalyze and visualize the quantitative dataset. Key output including p-values, effect\nsizes, and confidence intervals will be reported from statistical tests.

The findings will contribute meaningful\ninsights to the field of study.\nTheme 1: Financial Disbursement Challenges\nThe interview data revealed that Sacco members face numerous challenges related to\nfinancial disbursement that severely hinder their access to funds.\nA major challenge frequently highlighted was an overall lack of transparency around\nfund allocation from the Sacco leadership. Many participants expressed anger and\nconfusion over the opaque processes for loan approvals and disbursement scheduling.\nAs Participant A shared, \"We never know when or if we'll receive the funds we request.\nThe leaders are like a black box - we apply for loans, but have no idea what happens\nor when we'll ever see the money.\" This uncertainty was attributed to poor\ncommunication from leaders and lack of member access to financial records. Some\nmembers speculated that funds were intentionally withheld or rerouted based on\nnepotism or bribes.\nIn addition to transparency issues, participants faced extended delays in receiving\nallocated funds in a timely manner. They reported waiting months longer than initially", "word_count": 269, "start_char": 43430, "end_char": 45288}

According to research\nby Okelo et al. (2019), such delays can cause major cash flow issues and lost\nopportunities for Sacco members, severely hindering their livelihoods and ability to\ngrow their businesses. Many shared stories of missed investments, failed ventures, and\ngeneral financial instability due to relying on the inconsistent disbursements.\nParticipants also described very limited access to financial statements, records or\nupdates from the Sacco leadership. This lack of documentation made it impossible for\nthem to track and understand their accounts, loans, or share balances. \"We're left\ntotally in the dark,\" said Participant C. According to a transparency study by Wanyama\n(2016), this information asymmetry erodes trust and gives leaders potential\nopportunities for unmonitored misuse of funds.\nIn summary, the extensive issues around lack of transparency, uncertainty, delays, and\nfinancial record access significantly obstructed members' ability to obtain and utilize\nSacco funds meant to help support their livelihoods. This resulted in much anger and\ndistrust toward leadership. If left unresolved, these financial barriers could\ndestabilize the Sacco.\nTheme 2: Financial Management Issues\nRegarding financial management, the interviewed members reported deep concerns\nover accountability, mismanagement and corruption within the Sacco's leadership.\nA frequent complaint was the complete lack of transparency and record-keeping\naround how loan and group fund balances were being managed. As Participant B\ndescribed, \"We have no idea how our money is being used - the leaders refuse to share", "word_count": 279, "start_char": 45013, "end_char": 46964}

Where did that money come from?\" According to Okioma et\nal. (2017), such incidents erode member trust in leaders and can lead to mass\nwithdrawal of funds, destabilizing the Sacco.\nA number of participants also reported strong suspicions of bribery around preferential\nloan approvals and disbursement for leaders' family, friends and allies. However, the\nlack of audited financial reports made such corruption impossible to prove. According\nto one member, \"If you're not in the chairman's inner circle, you'll never get a loan\napproved.\" This perceived graft and favoritism led to deep resentments among\nmembers.\nOverall, the extensive mismanagement and lack of transparency resulted in highly\ndysfunctional governance plagued by member distrust, complaints of unfairness, and\naccusations of abuse of funds. If allowed to continue unchecked, this threatens the\nfinancial health and sustainability of the entire Sacco, along with members'\nlivelihoods.\nExternal oversight and reforms are critically needed.\n4.7 Presentation and Analysis of Quantitative Data\nIn this section, the quantitative data collected through interviews will be presented\nand analyzed. The data will be tabulated and analyzed using descriptive statistics to\n\nprovide insights into the extent of financial disbursement and management challenges\nwithin the YLP groups.\nTable 4.1: Financial Disbursement Challenges\nChallenge\nFrequency\nPercentage\nLack of Transparency\n32.5%\nDelays in Disbursement\n19.5%\nLack of Accountability\n26.0%\nTable 4.2: Financial Management Issues\nIssue\n\nFrequency\nPercentage\nMisuse of Funds\n29.2%\nLack of Accountability\n35.7%\nCorruption\n16.2%\n\n4.7 Interpretation of Qualitative and Quantitative Findings\nThe quantitative results presented in Tables 4.1 and 4.2 offer critical numerical\ninsights that augment the qualitative findings to comprehensively elucidate the\nfinancial disbursement and management challenges plaguing the studied Sacco.\nRegarding disbursement issues, the data reveals widespread member dissatisfaction\nwith lack of transparency, with this issue affecting nearly one third of respondents.\nThis aligns closely with the interview themes showing members’ frustration with\nopaque processes and poor communication from leaders regarding loan approvals and", "word_count": 413, "start_char": 46725, "end_char": 49651}

As noted by Khandker et al. (2016), lack of\ntransparency around cooperative lending can promote corruption and mistrust. The\nprevalence of this challenge suggests deep issues with ethical leadership and\ngovernance within the Sacco.\nAdditionally, the finding that delays in receiving disbursed funds affected 19.5% of\nmembers underscores the qualitative reports of severe delays in loan payments or\naccount distributions. According to Ledgerwood et al. (2013), such delays can cause\nmajor cash flow and planning issues for borrowers, significantly harming productivity\nand performance. The magnitude of this problem may indicate capacity issues in loan\nprocessing and disbursement that need addressing through improved systems and\naccountable management.\nRegarding financial management, the data points to even more pervasive concerns.\nThe finding that over one third of members cited lack of accountability indicates deep\ngrievances with leaders failing to report on use of Sacco funds. As noted by Muriuki et\nal. (2001), this opacity around internal lending and financial flows can disguise\nmismanagement and embezzlement. Building transparency through financial\nmonitoring and reporting mechanisms is critical.\nAdditionally, close to 30% of respondents outright reported misuse of funds through\nunauthorized spending or misappropriation. This gives concrete credence to serious\nqualitative allegations of unethical practices by leaders. Left unchecked, such\nfinancial malpractice can destabilize the Sacco through lost trust and withdrawals\n(Olando et al. 2012). Official external audits are clearly needed.\n\nFinally, the 16.2% of members reporting perceived corruption substantiates qualitative\nclaims of preferential lending to leaders’ associates. According to Wanyama (2009),\nperceived fairness in lending is essential to cooperative success. The data suggests\nreforms are needed to ensure equitable policy and Practice around approvals.\nIn summary, the quantitative findings strongly validate members’ grave concerns\nelucidated through interviews around financial access barriers and mismanagement.\nThe prevalence of these issues likely severely undermines the Sacco’s benefits and\nthreatens its sustainability if governance reforms are not urgently undertaken.\nComprehensive transparency measures, accountability mechanisms, audits, and\noversight are critically necessary to align operations with cooperative principles and\nrestore member trust.

As established\nin the literature, information asymmetry is antithetical to cooperative ideals of\ndemocratic participation (Muthuma, 2021). Moreover, opaque allocation enables\nmisappropriation, as evidenced by close to 30% of members citing misuse of funds.\nThis aligns with Wanyama's (2016) assertions that lack of transparency breeds\nmistrust, dysfunction, and instability within microfinance cooperatives. If left\nunaddressed through accountability reforms, these transparency and communication\ngaps could seriously undermine the Sacco's member-driven purpose.\nAdditionally, the 19.5% of members experiencing delays in receiving allocated funds\naffirms prior studies showing late disbursement causes major planning and\nproductivity issues for borrowers (Ledgerwood et al., 2013). The extent of this\nproblem suggests inefficiency and lack of accountability in loan processing and\nallocation systems, which demand capacity building and oversight to uphold\nresponsible lending. Without timely disbursement, the Sacco cannot effectively serve\nits purpose of facilitating livelihood development.\n\nMost critically, the findings around lack of accountability and misuse of funds have\ndeep implications for members’ trust in leaders and the Sacco's sustainability. Over\none third of members reported zero financial accountability, which Muriuki et al.\n(2001) links directly to mismanagement and even embezzlement. This is likely already\noccurring given nearly 30% of respondents cited misappropriation. Left unaddressed,\nthese practices will almost certainly escalate, destabilizing the Sacco through lost\nmember trust, savings withdrawals, and collapse (Olando et al. 2012). External audits\nand oversight are urgently needed to instill accountability.\nFinally, perceived favoritism in lending contradicts principles of cooperative equity,\nthreatening members’ buy-in (Wanyama, 2009). Comprehensive governance reforms\nare essential to realign operations with member-driven democratic values. Without\naccountable, ethical leadership, this Sacco will fail its mission to empower its\nmembers economically.\nIn conclusion, the study provides alarming insights into financial malpractices that\nrequire immediate, comprehensive redress to secure members’ interests and the\nSacco's sustainability. Failure to enact reforms aligning governance with cooperative\nprinciples will have dire consequences. Through transparency, accountability, audits\nand oversight, this Sacco can be transformed into an empowering democratic\ninstitution true to its purpose.

Specifically, the lack of transparency around allocation\nprocesses breeds distrust, dysfunction, and potential misappropriation, as one third of\nmembers reported opacity issues. Additionally, delays in disbursing approved funds to\nnearly 20% of members severely hampers their productivity and progress.\nEven more critically, the study exposed alarming deficiencies in financial stewardship,\nwith over a third of members reporting zero accountability from leaders. This almost\ncertainly enables the misuse of funds cited by close to 30% of respondents.\nFurthermore, perceived preferential lending contradicts principles of equitable\ndemocratic participation that are foundational to cooperatives.\nIn conclusion, the results align with and affirm the extensive literature demonstrating\nthat such financial malpractice fundamentally threatens the member-driven mission\nof community-based microfinance groups (Muriuki et al., 2001; Wanyama 2009;\nOlando et al., 2012). Without urgent and comprehensive reforms to install\ntransparency, accountability, audits, and oversight, this Sacco will likely fail, along\nwith the livelihoods of its members.\n\nIn summary, this study’s findings constitute an unequivocal mandate for leaders to\nundertake immediate, wholesale governance changes to align operations with\ncooperative principles of ethical, responsible financial stewardship. Through such\nmember-driven reforms, this institution can be transformed into an engine of\nempowerment true to its purpose. In contrast, inaction will have dire consequences.\nThese discoveries crystallize an urgent call to action to safeguard both the Sacco’s\nsustainability and the interests of its members. The very future of this vital\ncommunity institution hangs in the balance.\n5.3 Recommendations\nBased on the concerning insights uncovered through this study regarding the financial\nmismanagement plaguing the Sacco, several recommendations can be made to\nstrengthen governance, accountability, and sustainability:\n1. Radically improve transparency through regular financial reporting to members,\nwith documentation on lending processes, loan approvals, disbursement timing,\nand use of Sacco funds. Frequent updates and member access to records\npromotes democratic\nparticipation.\n2.

Cultivate a member-driven ethical culture through workshops promoting\ntransparency, accountability and zero tolerance for malpractice. Member vigilance\nkeeps leaders honest.\n8. Explore integrating targeted individual lending mechanisms to complement\nexisting communal funds where appropriate based on members’ needs and plans.\nCustomized options can expand financial access.\n9. Undertake fundraising campaigns and partnerships with external impact investors,\ngovernment agencies and NGOs to access additional resources that can strengthen\ninstitutional capacity.\nBy urgently enacting reforms aligned with these recommendations, this Sacco can\nrebuild trust, efficiency and good governance to effectively serve members’ interests\n\nfor years to come. With member-driven oversight and accountability, it will transform\ninto a truly democratic, empowering institution.\nLimitations of the Research\nWhile this study provided important insights into the financial management issues\nfaced by members of the studied Sacco, the research does have several limitations\nthat must be acknowledged.\nFirstly, the study was geographically narrow in scope, focusing only on members of a\nsingle Sacco in one specific region. The findings may not be widely generalizable to\nmembers of other Saccos operating in different locales or under different\ncircumstances.\nA larger scale study across multiple sites could improve\ngeneralizability.\nAdditionally, the sample size of participants, while sufficient for initial research, was\nrelatively small. A larger and more randomized sample could provide more robust\nquantifiable data on the prevalence of various challenges. Relatedly, the sampling\nmethodology used was non-randomized purposive sampling, which has inherent biases\nversus randomized techniques.\nFurthermore, this research was qualitatively focused, and relied heavily on\nselfreported data from interviews and surveys. More objective quantitative data\ngathering through analysis of financial records could strengthen the evidence base and\nreduce reporting bias. However, limited data access constrained broader analysis.", "word_count": 425, "start_char": 57998, "end_char": 61224}

More sophisticated validated tools and analytical\napproaches in future studies could enhance the rigor and quality of the data obtained.\nFinally, since this was a cross-sectional study taking place over a limited time period,\nit lacked a longitudinal component. Long-term tracking of how identified challenges\nevolve over time could provide richer insights. A longitudinal approach is\nrecommended for future research.\nIn summary, while this research makes valuable initial contributions, enhancements in\nthe sample size, geographic scope, data gathering tools, analytical strategies,\nobjectivity, and longitudinal nature of the study could strengthen the evidence base\nand generalizability of the findings. These limitations highlight areas for\nmethodological improvement in subsequent studies to deepen understanding of this\ncritical topic. Nonetheless, the present findings do provide important first insights\nthat make a useful scholarly contribution.\nSuggestions for Further Research\nThis research makes an important early contribution to understanding financial\nmanagement challenges within youth livelihood groups, but further studies are\nneeded to deepen and extend the findings.\nFirstly, the geographical scope could be expanded to conduct comparative case\nstudies across multiple regions and districts in Uganda. This would assess if similar\nfinancial issues are plaguing groups nationally versus just those in Mukono. Regional\nvariations could illuminate local contextual success or failure factors.\n\nSecondly, investigating a wider range of government and NGO-sponsored livelihood\ninterventions beyond just the YLP would be beneficial. Comparing groups from\nprograms such as the Women’s Entrepreneurship Fund, the Parish Development Model,\nNorthern Uganda Social Action Fund, and more could uncover potentially systemic\nissues.\nThirdly, longer-term longitudinal studies that track groups over many years would\nprovide greater insight into how financial management evolves over the lifespan of a\ngroup. This could identify chronic versus temporary challenges.\nFourthly,\ncomparative\nresearch\nexplicitly\ninvestigating\ndifferences\nbetween\ngroupbased versus individual-based approaches would elucidate their relative merits\nand limitations. This could help inform policies on optimal targeting and loan\ndisbursement mechanisms.", "word_count": 388, "start_char": 60762, "end_char": 63682}
