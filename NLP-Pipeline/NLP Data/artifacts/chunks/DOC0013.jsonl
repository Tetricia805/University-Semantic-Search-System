With progression of generations over seasons, seeds vary in the\nstability levels of inheritance of superior traits for germination pointing out the\ndifference in levels of seed quality for efficient crop establishment and growth. This\nresearch evaluated seed quality of Solanum aethiopicum Shum varieties E11, E15, and\nE16 over two seasons and the effect of germination synchrony on plant growth\nperformance. This was objectively to check for stability of germination of the varieties\nwith progression over seasons and establish how levels of germination synchrony\ninfluence plant establishment and growth.\nThe experiment was carried out in a screen house at Uganda Christian University,\nMukono using a Completely Randomized Design, with three replicates for three\nvarieties. Germination study was conducted in a healing chamber and germination\nmetrics recorded were germination percentage, mean germination time, germination\nvelocity index, and germination synchrony. Subsequent plant growth was conducted in\na screen house and growth metrics studied were plant height, plant canopy, stem girth,\nleave dimensions, and petiole traits.\nResults of the study indicated that germination performance varied across all varieties\nover seasons with p-value 0.229 for germination percentage, p-value 2.46 for Mean\nGermination Time, p-value 0.046 for Germination Velocity Index, and p-value 0.064 for\nGermination Synchrony at significance level of 5%. Furthermore, different levels of\ngermination synchrony across the varieties had marginal to significant effects on plant\ngrowth performance where variety E11 expressed relatively stable genetic expression\nacross seasons in its germination rates followed by varieties E15 and E16. Additionally,\ndifferent germination synchrony levels exhibited variations in all plant growth\nparameters with exception of petiole length suggesting a strong influence of\n\niii\n\ngermination synchrony on plant establishment other the germination velocity index on\nplant growth.\nDeclaration\nI ECORA FAITH AKILE hereby declare that this dissertation is entirely my original work\nexcept where I have acknowledged references by other authors, and it has not been\npresented partially or wholly in any other institution for any award.\nSignature: ecora faith akile\nDate: 15th April, 2025\n\niv", "word_count": 419, "start_char": 0, "end_char": 2956}

It is also referred to as scarlet eggplant or\ngarden egg, said to have originated from tropical Africa (Plaza et al., 2024) and evolved\nfrom Solanum anguivi (Godfrey et al., 2017). It is one of the four sub-groups of Solanum\naethiopicum on morphological variations which include gilo, kumba, aculeatum, and\nShum, cultivated for their leaves and fruits for consumption and ornamental purposes\nfor the aculeatum group (Buteme et al., 2021). The Shum group locally known as\n‘nakati’ in Uganda is a common highly nutritious African Indigenous Vegetable, (AIV)\ncultivated for its leaves (Kabod et al., 2018). However, the vegetable has received less\nattention (Nakyewa et al., 2021), and there is limited knowledge about the crop among\nresearchers (Botey et al., 2019; Han et al., 2021) and so to explore this loophole, this\nstudy focuses on evaluating seed quality of the African vegetable considering seed\ngermination as an indicator. Seed germination is influenced by a combination of genetic\ntraits and environmental conditions, essential for understanding plant adaptation,\npopulation dynamics, and cultivation success (Maleki et al., 2023). As shown by Ghaleb\net al. (2022), factors such as germinability and rate can vary within seed populations\nacross generations, reflecting adaptive mechanisms or selective pressures in response\nto cultivation practices and environmental shifts. This aligns with Govindaraju and\nDancik’s (2021) findings, which highlight that stability indices in germination can differ\nsignificantly across developmental stages, stressing the importance of evaluating\ngenetic stability over time to check for heritability levels over the seasons (Sales et al.,\n2013). The African eggplant is known to have a germination period of 5-9 or even more\ndays from sowing (Lozano et al., 2022) which accounts for possibility in difference of\nrates of germination with a germination percentage range of 0%-25% (Botey et al., 2021)\nindicating variation in seed quality among varieties across seasons\nSynchrony, or the uniform timing and simultaneous germination among seeds (Botey et\nal., 2021), can impact plant establishment, competition, and resilience to\nenvironmental stresses.

To further\ncontribute to the understanding of synchrony in the three cultivated species based on\nseed quality, this research will explore whether this trait remains consistent or adapts\nbased on environmental and genetic influences, and the extent of this variation across\nseasons for the different varieties highlighting the potential implications for breeding,\ncommercial bulking, and cultivation practices.\nAs shown by Ghaleb et al. (2022), factors such as germinability and rate can vary within\nseed populations across generations, reflecting adaptive mechanisms or selective\npressures in response to cultivation practices and environmental shifts and so the\npurpose of studying different seasons points out the stability for inheritance of\ndesirable traits by the relative varieties over the seasons to identify heritability levels.\nTherefore, germination synchrony explains dormancy patterns and seed adaptation to\nthe environment and it is relatively expressed over seasons due to heritable fitness\ntraits that are relative to individuals and varieties (Walter et al., 2023)\n1.2 Statement of the problem\nSolanum aethiopicum Shum presents differences in seed germination days (Han et al.,\n2021) over a range of five (5) or more days that is 5-9 days from sowing and a\ngermination percentage range 0-25% (Botey et al., 2022) which is wide enough to\noptimize varieties with highest germinability and synchrony over seasons. Within a\nseed’s potential, germination stability indices can differ across developmental stages\n(Govindaraju & Dancik, 2021). During germination, seed adaptations to germination\nconditions in the environment differ in occurrence of processes of imbibition, enzyme\nactivation, elongation of the hypocotyl, and seed coat rupture. The difference in\ngermination timing categorizes the Shum plant population into early and late\ngerminators depending on the timing of seedling emergence. This, subsequently affects\noverall plant fitness, health and yield of the population basing on the stability levels of\ninheritance of different varieties across generations for plant breeding programs and", "word_count": 362, "start_char": 13317, "end_char": 15830}

To investigate the germination rate of the three released varieties of Solanum\naethiopicum Shum under optimum conditions across seasons (stability)\n2.

This results into a consistency in the gene frequency thus genetic\nuniformity where constant alleles for desirable traits are identified, providing an insight\ninto breeding practices through reliable data for seed viability and vigor, and bulking\nseed production systems for seed quality based on performance across seasons (Kebede\net al., 2016). According to Gramazio et al., 2017, enhancing the seed system for scarlet\neggplant aligns with the global efforts through the Sustainable Development Goals,\n(SDG) to develop climate- smart and resilient vegetable varieties. Through this study,\nresearchers can determine the extent to which synchrony is maintained over planting\nseasons, suggesting a strong genetic relative for the three varieties.

Uniform crop establishment and maturity, makes cultivation\nless difficult for the local farmers in terms of management to obtain consistent, reliable\ncrop production, and steady income generation (Bewley & Bradford, 1994).\n1.6 Significance\nWith rising global concerns about climate variability, seed quality evaluation through\ngermination synchrony is a selectively adaptive trait which stabilizes crop\nestablishment under variable climatic conditions (Merrick et al., 2020). This is\nespecially relevant to the Sub- Saharan countries with unpredictable rains and\ntemperature shifts. By analyzing the traits in the different varieties for seed quality,\ngenetic diversity within the species is evaluated, providing ground for future breeding\nefforts to strengthen nutrition and food security (Grubben and Denton, 2004).\nEvaluating seed quality traits of different Shum varieties especially germination\nsynchrony, to be utilized by commercial producers for bulking reduces cases of\nreplanting and excessive seed usage which contributes to resource efficiency and\nminimizes agricultural wastage thus aligning with sustainable agriculture goals that\nemphasize responsible use of inputs to protect environmental resources without\ncompromising long- term productivity (Bradford et al., 2017). Identifying seed quality\nstability traits of Solanum aethiopicum Shum also holds importance in achieving uniform\nseedling emergence and establishment thereby enhancing agronomic efficiency by\noptimizing agricultural productivity and obtaining consistent yields especially in\nresource-constrained farming systems (Bradford et al., 2017).\n1.7 Conceptual frame work\n\nINDEPENDENT VARIABLE\nShum variety (genotype) &\nseason- method 1\nGermination timing, variety,\nseason – Method 2\nDEPENDENT VARIABLE\nGermination- method 1\nPlant growth metric- Method 2\nPhysiological processes\n(intervening/Mediating\nvariable)\nconditions", "word_count": 303, "start_char": 17397, "end_char": 19685}

Shum is one of the four sub- groups of S. aethiopicum alongside other\ngroups of gilo, kumba, and aculetum (Jäger et al., 2023)\n2.2 Botany and agronomy of S. aethipicum Shum\nIt is often grown as an annual crop, with its leaves being harvested for 2 or more\nseasons. However, it is a perennial plant with more or less woody and much branched\nstems. Its propagation is by seed, with germination taking averagely 5- 9 days (Botey\net al., 2022) and transplanting of seedlings to the field is done 30- 35 days from the day\nof sowing when plants have attained a height of 15- 20cm with 5- 7 leaves. Seedlings\ngrow at a fast rate and flowering starts at 40- 100 days from sowing and first flowers\nare concurrently initiated with branching and the production of younger leaves (Prakash\n& Sharma, 2017; Bragard et al., 2021).\nIt can be cultivated in home gardens and grown commercially for sale in local markets.\nWith a growing season of at least three months, the plant does best in areas with annual\nday time temperatures ranging between 20- 300C and a mean annual rainfall of\n1200mm- 1600mm but tolerant to lower amounts of 800mm. Moderately fertile, welldrained soils that are exposed to sunlight are best for the plant with PH range of 5.5- 7\nis best, while ensuring moderate nitrogen levels to optimize leaf yield. Where irrigation\nis involved, yield ranges between 12- 20t/ha with improved cultivars yielding 50- 80t/ha\nunder favorable conditions. Shum cultivars under good management produce up to 75\nleaf bundles of 30kg each implying a yield potential of 225t/ha (Buteme et al., 2021).\nThis enables for optimization of varieties with highest seed quality in terms of\ngermination timing, percentage, and synchrony to achieve that yield potential.\n( Bragard et al., 2021)", "word_count": 346, "start_char": 19685, "end_char": 21786}

This affects responses such as the reduction in leaf\nelongation and impacts stomatal closure, thereby reducing the nutrient value of\nstressed plants and lowering their market value (Gabriel, 2013; Kiwuka et al., 2020)\nAfrica is experiencing climate variations where the normal dry and wet seasons are\ncurrently shifting to being wetter and hotter than before, posing challenges to plant\nresilience to water loss (Mubiru et al., 2018). This has created a gap that causes yield\nlosses, hence prompting the need for optimization of well-performing Shum varieties\nwith early, rapid, and synchronized germination to improve field management practices\nuniformly across all established plants (Bragard et al., 2021). Locally, in Uganda,\nfarmers and gender-based preferences for Nakati varieties vary depending on the yield\nexperienced in the major Nakati-growing districts, namely Mukono, Wakiso, and\nLuweero (Nakyewa et al., 2021) The identification of the variety with the highest\nsynchrony has been shown to produce more yield compared to others, contributing to\nthe livelihoods of an estimated 400,000 people in Uganda (Nakyewa et al.,\n2021;Nsubuga et al., 2014). Nonetheless, erratic germination behavior and poor\nseedling establishment are also common challenges faced by farmers, often due to\nreliance on saved and recycled seeds (Botey et al., 2019, 2021). These issues highlight\nthe importance of understanding seed germination dynamics and developing varieties\nwith desirable germination traits like synchronization.\n2.4 Importance of seed quality\nSeed quality, as a vital aspect of successful crop production, includes physiological\naspects such as germination capacity, vigor, viability, and physical aspects of purity and\nhealth (ElMary et al., 2019; Turner et al., 2020). The seed quality assessment is vital\nfor high yield potential as well as encouraging effective seed usage in agricultural\nsystems (Dias et al., 2023).

Studies have\nrevealed various key insights such as intra-varietal variability where research shows\nthat S. aethiopicum exhibits genetic diversity affecting germination rates (Buteme et\nal., 2021). Differences in floral and phenological traits among varieties contribute to\nvariability in seed vigor and synchrony.\nWhile there is a lack of specific research on the germination rate and stability of S.\naethiopicum Shum varieties across generations, studies on related Solanum species\nprovide valuable insights (Botey et al., 2021). Physiological dormancy, observed in\nSolanum melongena and Solanum torvum, can also contribute to low germination\npercentages (Botey et al., 2017) and this may be influenced by the maturity stage of\nthe fruit at harvest and the extraction process (Botey et al., 2017). Genetic factors\nsuch as seed size and the rate and duration of seed filling, can impact the accumulation\nof food reserves within the seed, (Silva et al., 2015; Santos et al., 2020; Botey, 2022)\nwhich in turn, influences germination and initial seedling growth.\n2.6 Impact of germination timing on growth\nThe timing of germination plays a pivotal role in determining early-stage plant vigor\nand overall development in factors like competition for resources to impact seedling\nsurvival and growth (Sales et al.,2013). Related studies reveal that early germinating\nseeds of Solanaceae, including S. melongena, outperformed late germination in plant\nfitness such as root and shoot development (Margenot et al., 2016; Verdu, M., Travest,\nA., 2005). Similar effects were observed in S. aethiopicum, where early germinators\nhad higher biomass accumulation. Physiologically, early germination positively\nimpacted nutrient absorption and stress resilience, especially under optimized\n\nfertilization regimes (Margenot et al., 2016). As per crop establishment, early and\nuniform germination ensured synchronized growth phases, reducing competition for\nresources (Buteme et al., 2021). While maintaining all environmental factors constant\nin a screen house, the study aims to evaluate germination characteristics across seasons\nfor the three varieties so as to identify the variety with superior genetic strength of\ndesirable traits of early and synchronous germination for positive impact on subsequent\ngrowth and potentially higher- yielding plants.", "word_count": 449, "start_char": 23905, "end_char": 27020}

It lies at an altitude of 1158-1219m above sea level. The district\nreceives two wet seasons with an annual rainfall ranging between 1100 and 1400mm.\nTemperatures experienced range between 210C and 290C with coordinates 00020’N\n32045’E. This experiment ran from January 2024 to March 2025 with day screen house\ntemperatures ranging between 180C to 420C\n3.1.2 Study material\nSeeds for the three released varieties of Solanum aethiopicum Shum, 148 (E11), 137\n(E15) & 184 (E16) were used. These were obtained from the faculty of Agricultural\nSciences seed bank, and seeds used were selfed- seeds (hybrids). Variety E11 is\ncharacterized with green stems, green leaves and leaf veins with generally whole leaf\nmargins, variety E15 has green- purple stems, green leaf veins, and moderately serrated\nleaf margins, and E16 is purple stemmed, has green leaves with purple-green leaf veins,\nand has serrated leaf margins\n3.1.3 Experimental Design\nUsing Complete Randomized Design, (CRD), 100 seeds for each variety were planted in\nplanting trays with 3 replicates for each variety for the germination study (Steel &\nTorrie, 1980), ensuring sufficient sample size for statistical analysis(Ranal & De Santana,\n2006).

Plant canopy refers to the above\nground spread of the plant by measuring the diameter. Larger canopies indicate better\nvegetative growth with more leaf area thus a higher photosynthetic capacity beneficial\nfor growth performance. Canopy development can be influenced by the variety (genetic\npotential) and germination vigor and uniformity which influence early growth.

Thicker stems can support better plant performance by nutrient flow and\nwithstanding environmental stresses as compared to thinner plant stems. Variety E15\nproduced the thickest stems at synchrony level of 0.14 suggesting better vegetative\ngrowth with significance difference. E16 demonstrated thinner stems under low\nsynchrony levels, compromising stability levels while E11 produced plants with thin\nstems under 0.14 germination synchrony. The number of leaves of a plant indicates the\nvegetative growth of the plant. A larger number of leaves generally indicates higher\nphotosynthetic capacity supporting better plant growth performance as compared to\nplants with fewer leaves.

Germination\nsynchrony affects leaf elongation alongside the genetics of the plant varieties. The\nmeasurement across the broadest part of the leaf is the leaf width and it presents a\nsurface for photosynthetic activity of the plant. Broader leaves capture more sunlight\nimplying higher photosynthesis rates for biomass production and growth.

In this case, the superior height observed in variety E11 as compared\nto E15 and E16 illustrates how specific genetic traits can lead to enhanced growth\nperformance. For plant canopy growth, E11 and E16 produced superior canopy size\nsignificantly different from E11 (p=0.50). This result supports the assertions made by\nDiouf et al., who confirmed significant variability among varieties concerning\nvegetative traits including plant canopy (Diouf et al., 2017)\nWith stem grith, germination synchrony had a significantly different relation at p=0.004.\nThis observation suggests that synchronized germination positively affects stem\nrobustness, essential for structural support for the plant and as well contrasts with the\nstudy which emphasized that plant morphological traits maybe moderated against\nenvironment variability (Rixen et al., 2022). This illustrates the interactions between\nenvironmental timing and genetic expression of traits. Leaf morphological traits that is\nnumber, length, and width showed a significance (p<0.005). The highest leaf count in\nE15, E16, and E11 respectively confirm that genetic factors greatly govern leaf\nattributes ( Farooq et al. 2010) and the role of leaf dimensions in shaping plant success\nis widely supported to correlate leaf traits and overall growth efficiency ( Falster et\nal., 2018; Chen et al., 2021)\nPetiole traits that is length and color, presented lack of significance influence neither\nby variety nor germination synchrony at p=0.176 and p=0.5778. this result suggests\ninherent stability in these traits under varying conditions, aligning with interpretations\nfrom Macklin et al., 2022 regarding consistency of leaf trait (Macklin et al., 2022)\nMeanwhile, the significant difference observed in petiole color at p<0.005 proves that\n\ncertain traits remain strongly influenced by genetic factors other than germination\ntiming", "word_count": 359, "start_char": 50079, "end_char": 52521}

Thereby at p> 0.005,\nwith p-value 0.0635, the study confirmed significant difference in germination\nsynchrony among all varieties across seasons, resulting into failure to reject hypothesis\n1 where the findings of the research show that E11 was the most stable variety across\nboth seasons with high germination percentages, short germination times, and strong\ngermination velocity. E15 produced a slight variability with slightly lower stability across\nboth seasons and E16 demonstrated the highest variation across both seasons,\nsuggesting lowest adaptability and stability\nTo determine subsequent plant growth at different germination synchrony levels across\nthe selected varieties, the objective was hypothesized that there was difference in the\neffects of germination synchrony on subsequent growth across the selected varieties.\nMoreover, the study also confirmed significant differences in subsequent growth\nparameters at the various germination synchrony levels across the selected varieties\nthus failure to reject hypothesis 2. This is illustrated by the results which indicated that\ngermination synchrony subsequently affects plant establishment but plant growth is\nmore influenced by germination velocity index other than uniformity of germination\n6.1 Recommendations\nFurther research by plant breeders to identify superior traits of stability levels in variety\nE11 as it exhibited better germination and growth performance over the seasons, to\nimprove the genetic potential of other varieties. Additionally, optimization of\ncultivation of varieties E11 and E15 by farmers for stable yields over seasons\n\nAPPENDIX\nTable 6: work plan and time frame\nWORK PLAN/ TIME FRAME\nBUDGET\nActivity\nMonth\nMonth 2 Month 3 Month 4 Month 5 AMOUNT\n(UGX)\nConcept\ndevelopment\n\nProposal writing\n\nProposal defense\n\nExperiment set up &\nmaintenance\n\n449,000\nData collection\n\nData analysis\n\nProposal, data sheet,\n&\nDissertation\nprinting\n\n100,000\nTOTAL\n549,000\n\nFigure 11: Objective 1 data sheet\n\nFigure 12: Objective 2 data sheet\n\nFigure 13: Mixing loam soil with poultry manure in the ratio of 2:1\n\nFigure 14: steam sterilizing of mixed soil\n\nFigure 15: watering plants in the screen house\n\nFigure 16: data collection", "word_count": 369, "start_char": 52521, "end_char": 55072}
