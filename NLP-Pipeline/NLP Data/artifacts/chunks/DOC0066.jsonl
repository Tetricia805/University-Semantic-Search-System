The\npurpose of this study is to compare female and male perceptions of work ethic, unethical behavior and\nconsumerism, and use this as a basis to examine whether unethical behavior and its antecedents explain\nconsumerism in an emerging market context where consumer protection is at a minimum. Based on a\ncross sectional survey research design, this study uses valid measures from previous studies to collect\ndata from a systematic sample of students from a large private university, Findings indicate that women\nand male students do not differ much on most of the items on the three scales. Further the study finds\na direct link between perceived unfairness, unethical behavior and consumerism, while work ethic and\nconsumerism are mediated by unethical behavior. Implications for government and business organizations are discussed.\nINTRODUCTION\nConsumerism and consumption are central activities in many societies today (Shah, 2014), and in many\nnations consumption has moved beyond the basics of life to include luxury and other technological innovations that simplify life. A consumerist society is defined as one largely directed by the accumulation\nand consumption of material goods (O’Shaughnessy & O’ Shaughnnessy, 2002), with people in such\nsocieties thinking much of themselves and very little of others (Lee et al, 2009). It can be said in general\nthat peoples’ consumption patterns and the purpose of this consumption influence how they extract\nresources, manufacture and market products and eventually produce pollution and waste (Shah, 2014).\nHence along with consumerism are positive impacts as well as obvious negative effects like environmental\nEthically Questionable Behavior\nand Consumerism in Uganda:\nA Survey of University Students\nIsaac Wasswa Katono\nUganda Christian University, Uganda", "word_count": 328, "start_char": 0, "end_char": 2201}

However the gist of the matter is: what factors influence consumerism? Extant marketing\nliterature (Lee, Pant & Ali, 2009) postulates that unethical behavior in the market place gives rise to\nconsumerism, while this unethical behavior is itself bred by a poor work ethic and perceived unfairness\nin the market place among other factors. Based on earlier workers like Ali and Wisniesk (2010) as well\nas Fukukawa and Ennew (2010), this study examines the link between antecedents to unethical behavior (work ethic and perceived unfairness), and consumerism in Uganda using a sample of university\nstudents. The study seeks to address the key question “does ethically questionable behavior influence\nconsumerism in the market place in this country?”\nMarketing and Consumerism\nCurrent marketing practices have been accused of creating a consumerist or materialistic society (Abela,\n2006), though other authors such as O’Shaughnessy and O’ Shaughnnessy (2002) provide a spirited discourse in defense of marketing. As stated above, consumerism is associated with many negative effects\nto individuals and society. To elaborate, consumerism is associated with reduced consumer well being,\nparticularly in terms of home relationships and levels of happiness (Csikszentmihalyi, 2000) among\nother negative effects. Marketing theorists argue that there may be a causal link between materialism\nand well being, by suggesting that materialism involves a reversal of priorities by consumers giving up\nvalues and behaviors that tend to be associated with greater satisfaction, in favor of those associated with\nless satisfaction (Abela, 2006). Specifically Ahuvia and Wong (2002) posit that materialism prioritizes\nlower order needs over high order needs, resulting in lower levels of satisfaction. In support of this\nview, Burroughs and Rindfleisch (2002) contend that individualistic orientation of materialistic values\nconflicts with collective oriented values such as family or religion. Such a conflict ends up in tension,\nresulting in a reduced sense of well being. In further support of the relationship between marketing and\nthe growth of materialism, it has been established that there exists a causal link between advertising and\nmaterialism, and several studies have associated TV watching and TV advertising with high levels of\nmaterialism among children (Kinsey, 1987).\nOn the other hand and at a national level, consumerism as an ideology that celebrates consumption\nand spending in a society with less production capacity (as is the case in many developing countries like\nUganda), may constitute a threat to future development and strengthen the dependency on imports (Ali\n& Wisniesk, 2010). Consumerism in Uganda is evidenced in the central region where people sell their\nland indiscriminately to buy luxurious cars, expensive clothing, and expensive phones, build large houses,\nmotorcycles and so on. As explained in the next section, two major antecedents of ethically questionable\nbehavior that are not in short supply in Uganda, are a poor work ethic and perceived unfairness emanating from lack of a consumer protection policy/law in the country. These two variables could possibly be\nassociated with the consumerist attitude currently reigning in this country.\nConsumerism and Unethical Behavior\nThere is need for both marketers and buyers to be ethical in their conduct, for the efficient and effective running of the market place (Fullerton et al, 1996). Unethical behavior on the part of either of\nthem disrupts the relationship and gives rise to exchanges that are both “unproductive and ineffective”\n(Morgan & Hunt, 1994). Ethical consumer behavior can be defined as “decision making purchases and\nother consumption experiences, which are affected by the consumers’ ethical concerns” (Cooper-Martin", "word_count": 613, "start_char": 1951, "end_char": 6084}
