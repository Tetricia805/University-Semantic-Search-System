This chapter therefore presents; the\nbackground of the study, statement of the problem, purpose of the study, research\nobjectives, research questions, scope of the study, significance of the study, conceptual\nframework and definition of key terms.\n1.1 Background to the Study\nWorldwide, there were 15 major reported landslides last year, killing 1,480 people, with\nColombia, Nepal, Brazil, Indonesia, Tajikistan and Burundi also among the worstaffected countries. Two landslides were also among the world‘s 10 deadliest disasters in\n2015 – on a list topped by April‘s Nepal earthquake – killing 627 people in Guatemala in\nOctober and 256 in Afghanistan in April. Natural disasters are complex detrimental\nevents that occur entirely beyond the control of humans (Acosta, 2018). Natural disasters\ncan be classified based on the speed of onset; some disasters occur within seconds\n(landslides), minutes (tornadoes) or hours (flash floods and tsunamis) and others may take\nmonths or years to manifest themselves (droughts) and how they influence socioeconomic wellbeing of households. Furthermore, rapid onset disasters such as landslide\nshave a massive impact on human life and property.\nLandslides are more widespread than any other geological event, and can occur anywhere\nin the world. They occur when large masses of soil, rocks or debris move down a slope\ndue to a natural phenomenon or human activity. Mudslides or debris flows are also a\ncommon type of fast-moving landslides (Acosta, 2018). Landslides can accompany heavy\nrains or follow droughts, earthquakes or volcanic eruptions. Areas most vulnerable to\nlandslides include steep terrain, including areas at the bottom of canyons land previously\nburned by wildfires as well as land that has been modified due to human activity, such as\ndeforestation or construction. Between 1998-2017, landslides affected an estimated 4.8\nmillion people and cause more than 18 000 deaths and economic losses of about\n$65billion. Climate change and rising temperatures are expected to trigger more\nlandslides, especially in mountainous areas with snow and ice. As permafrost melts,\nrocky slopes can become more unstable resulting in a landslide. Using the global fatal", "word_count": 361, "start_char": 11697, "end_char": 14088}

Fatal\nlandslides triggered by natural variables occur mostly in the highest portions of the\ntopographic profile, where human disturbance is minimal. As for their anthropogenic\ncounterpart, these failures cluster at much lower altitudes, where slopes are gentler, but\nsocio-economic wellbeing of households is higher due to a higher population density.\nLandslides have had several other costs to countries as well: increased service\nexpenditures, demands on schools and losses in educational achievements and\nproductivity. In Chile, lack of landslides cost households $1.5 billion in lost earnings in\n2014 more than 2% of the country's GDP. In India, the World Bank survey (2016) found\nthat landslides contribute to 56% of household poverty. Landslides constitute a single\nbiggest risk to Australian households, resulting into 67% of reduced livelihoods and\neconomic losses of $13.7 billion a year. The World Bank is addressing the challenge of\nlandslides through precautionary means—for instance, by restricting or even removing\npopulations from areas with a history of landslides, by restricting certain types of land use\nwhere slope stability is in question, and by installing early warning systems based on the\nmonitoring of ground conditions such as strain in rocks and soils, slope displacement,\nand groundwater levels.\nLandslides are responsible for considerably greater economic and casualty losses than is\ngenerally recognized; they represent a significant element of many major disasters in\nwhich the magnitude of their effects is overlooked by news media. For example, the\ntremendous destruction and loss of life caused by the 1970 Huascaran disaster in Peru,\nwhich killed some 20,000 people, is often referred to in publications that review disasters\nas an earthquake disaster, because the landslide was triggered by an earthquake; this is in\nspite of the fact that the actual damage, destruction, and casualties were directly caused\nby a huge, high-velocity debris avalanche (Bodenlos and Ericksen, 2022).", "word_count": 434, "start_char": 13702, "end_char": 16672}
{"chunk_id": "DOC0098__00004", "doc_id": "DOC0098", "chunk_index": 4, "text": "On the basis of their analysis of landslide loss data for Southern California and\nextrapolation of these data to the rest of the nation, Krohn and Slosson (1976) estimated\nthe annual costs of landslides to private dwellings in the U.S. to be about $400 million in\n1971 dollars ($1.2 billion). This estimate did not include indirect costs or costs to public\nproperty, forest or agricultural lands, mines, or transportation or communications\nfacilities. In 1985 the U.S. National Research Council (Committee on Ground Failure\nHazards, 2020), using these estimates, rough approximations of indirect costs, and\ninflationary trends, evaluated annual landslide losses in the U. S. at about $1 billion to $2\nbillion ($1.6-$3.2 billion). Landslide deaths in the U.S. have been estimated at 25-50\npeople per year. Obviously these estimated annual losses are averages, which will be\nexceeded in some years, but will not be approached in others.\nA landslide is defined as the movement of a mass of rock, debris, or earth down a slope.\nLandslides are a type of \"mass wasting,\" which denotes any down-slope movement of soil\nand rock under the direct influence of gravity. The term \"landslide\" encompasses five\nmodes of slope movement: falls, topples, slides, spreads, and flows. These are further\nsubdivided by the type of geologic material (bedrock, debris, or earth). Debris flows\n(commonly referred to as mudflows or mudslides) and rock falls are examples of\ncommon landslide types and can greatly impact socio-economic wellbeing of households\n(Acosta, 2022).\nAlmost every landslide has multiple causes. Slope movement occurs when forces acting\ndown-slope (mainly due to gravity) exceed the strength of the earth materials that\ncompose the slope. Causes include factors that increase the effects of down-slope forces\nand factors that contribute to low or reduced strength (Bodenlos and Ericksen,\n2021). Landslides can be initiated in slopes already on the verge of movement by rainfall,\nsnowmelt, changes in water level, stream erosion, and changes in ground water,\nearthquakes, volcanic activity, disturbance by human activities, or any combination of\nthese factors. Earthquake shaking and other factors can also induce landslides underwater.\nThese landslides are called submarine landslides. Submarine landslides sometimes cause\ntsunamis that damage coastal areas.\nA depressingly high proportion of writing on landslides in Africa both in literature and\nelsewhere is based on wishful thinking.

They can be triggered by earthquakes, volcanism or heavy\nrainfall that changes the physical properties of rock and soil. Not only steep slopes pose a\nrisk, for some affect ground with quite gentle topography, as witness the terrible scenes\nfrom Sulawesi triggered by the 28 September 2018 magnitude 7.5 earthquakes beneath\nthe horn of Africa. This set in motion mudflows on gently sloping ground when the\nseismic waves caused liquefaction of unconsolidated sediments that not only shattered\ndwellings by the lateral motion, but many households sank into the slurry with little trace,\nproperty and livelihoods destroyed, . The rapid events left a death toll confirmed at 2010\npeople with about 5000 missing, feared to have been swallowed by the earth. In the last 9\nmonths mass movement has resulted in fatalities in many places, the most publicized\nbeing in Uganda, Malawi, Kenya, South Sudan and the list grows as it does every year.\nUganda is known as the ―Pearl of Africa‖ because of its stunning natural beauty and\nbiodiversity. Its lush vegetation is associated with regular tropical rainfall, but the East\nAfrican nation is now struggling to deal with more frequent and intense rains that are\ncausing landslides. Landslides can dump millions of tons of muddy debris in Uganda‘s\nrivers and streams, said Mary Goretti Kitutu, Uganda‘s minister of energy and mineral\ndevelopment and an expert on geology and landslides. Such debris can dam rivers, flood\nsurrounding areas, and cause damage to infrastructure.\n―The main landslide types [in Uganda] are debris slumps, which occur on concave slopes\nwhere water concentrates. Slopes facing northeast are most prone to landslides, which\ncoincide with the dominant rainfall direction,‖ Kitutu said. The region‘s soil profile is\nsignificant, she continued, explaining that ―topsoils have a high infiltration rate, which\nallows fast flow of water into the deeper, clay-rich horizons promoting water stagnation\nand causing slope failure.‖ Although Uganda has always experienced some loss of life\ndue to landslides, the number of casualties has increased this century. Over the past 25\nyears, catastrophic landslides have regularly hit the foothills of Mount Elgon, for\ninstance, which straddles the border between eastern Uganda and Kenya. The\nregion‘s most devastating landslide swept the slopes in 2010. Although more than 300\npeople are thought to have perished, only about 100 bodies were recovered. Thousands of\nhomes were damaged or destroyed.\nUgandan environmental specialist Mary Goretti Kitutu warns that despite traditional\nknowledge of how to avoid landslide risk, population pressures mean that people still cut\nterraces on slopes, till open land, cut down trees to create farmland and construction", "word_count": 486, "start_char": 19030, "end_char": 22162}

Community sensitization, encouraging family planning, relocating people from\nrisk areas and creating alternative income-generating activities to lessen pressure on land\nare crucial to counter this, she argues. In Bududa district, following the adoption of the\n15-year Sendai Framework of Disaster Risk Reduction by the international community in\nMarch last year, the Ugandan government has stepped up its drive for risk-informed\ndevelopment. That includes harnessing the wisdom of residents of Bududa and the other\nlandslide-prone eastern districts of Manafwa, Bulambuli and Sironko, assigning officials\nto document, integrate and promote traditional, indigenous and local knowledge to protect\nthe people and communities against disasters.\nMr. Martin Owor, Commissioner for Disaster Preparedness and Management at the\nOffice of the Prime Minister, confirms that despite flooding and landslides during the\n2015 El Nino-sparked rains, only three people are on record as having died. That was a\nsignificant drop from the 2007, 2010 and 2012 landslides when in total, over 300 lives\nwere lost. Mr. Owor attributes this fall in numbers to adequate planning, application of\ntraditional knowledge and strong partnerships between development partners, media\nhouses and the local community, despite limited resources. ―Our forefathers used to tell\nus about certain insects, birds, clouds and winds which act as early signs of rainy or dry\nseasons. People decided to ignore and abandon indigenous knowledge and then depended\nonly on science. But today, we have come to the realization that indigenous knowledge\nworks,‖ he says.\nHowever, there has been no comprehensive single author survey on the impact of\nlandslides on socio-economic wellbeing of households in Nametsi Sub County, Bududa\nDistrict. Not that the subject has suffered from any lack of interests but many historical\nscholars and publications particularly in Uganda and Africa have often been drawn more\nto the international scene than to the potentially more hazardous subject of academic\nperformance at home. Very few historical nodes have been made on the subject and the\nresulting literature has, however, almost exclusively taken the form of edited volumes,\nspecialized monographs and polemical contributions to debates and this is the gap this\nstudy filled.\n1.2 Problem statement\nDespite of well-funded government programmes in Nametsi sub-county, socio-economic\nwell-being of households is still very low.

Nametsi is one of the poorest and most\nmountainous areas in Bududa district. Of the sub-county's37, 687 people, 70% are\neconomically marginalized and 40% living in poverty (UBOS, 2021, Ministry of Finance,\nPlanning and Economic Development, 2020).\nThe public has with great concern observed that landslides impend socio-economic wellbeing of households in Nametsi Sub-County. Despite the interventions in Bududa through\nwealth creations programmes such as NAADS, NUSAF, youth livelihood fund and more\nrecently PDM, socio-economic well-being of households is poor and if nothing is done\nthere would be a likelihood of high illiteracy, constant morbidity, death and low\neconomic development, therefore strong and focused strategies are needed to reverse poor\nsocio-economic well-being of households.

This literature review has\nbeen done objective by objective.\n2.2 How human activities contributes to landslides\nAcosta (2018) found that excavation or cuts increase the slope angle if carried out without\nspecialist advise. Mining, blasting rock or reclamation of land can also destabilize slopes.\nFarming activities on slopes involve removal of vegetation cover usually followed by\nterracing. Sometimes, farmers burn down vegetation as a convenient method of clearing\nland for cultivation. Commercial logging results in deforestation. These activities increase\nsurface run-off of rainwater and expose the soil to erosion. Changes in water regime\nresults in raising or lowering of ground water table. Alteration of surface drainage can\nalso be a contributory factor.\nBodenlos and Ericksen (2018) argued that irrigation alters natural surface drainage.\nSurface run-off of irrigated water on slopes exposes soil under cultivation to erosion. Part\nof this water is absorbed by soil increasing its weight, which can put an additional load on\nthe slope. Seepage and accumulation of irrigated water on slopes can raise the ground\nwater table. This can also be a result of wastewater discharge, water pipe leakage from\npermanent and temporary storage facilities such as ponds and subsurface irrigation\nfacilities.\nSubstantially different, however, is the situation in those sliding areas, where human\nactivity is concentrated. It is so in the vicinity of towns and villages, in the main valleys\nand basins of the mountainous part of Slovakia, where industry, construction of\nresidential quarters, communications, water reservoirs, etc., are concentrated.

Based on the investigation of\nlandslides in Slovakia it can be stated that 90 % of all landslides, which occurred in\npopulated areas in the last 30 years and which caused the greatest damage, were brought\nabout fully, or partly by man‘s intervention in the sensible stability regime of old\nlandslides (Acosta, 2022).\nThe fact that inconsiderate human activity and the effects of construction work on old\nlandslides are the most frequent cause of reactivation of movements in areas of intense\neconomic use are also confirmed by several foreign studies. Thus Nilsen and Turner\n(2022) state that 80 % of the landslides, which have taken place since 1971 in California,\nwere brought about by artificial interventions. Similarly, Ojangole (2023) prove that in\nPensylvania artificially caused landslides amount to 90 % of newly occurred landslides.\nThe construction intervention in the slope environment according to Bodenlos and\nEricksen (2022) causes in it several simultaneously and consequently acting forces and\nprocesses, which may end in various changes on the slopes. These may also reflect back\non the state and behaviour of technical works. The changes may be not only of a varied\ntype, but also of varied intensity and duration (temporary and permanent, slow and quick,\nreversible and irreversible, etc.) The changes may be mediated directly or indirectly.\nThe Yellow River originates from the Tibetan Plateau and flows through nine provinces\nand autonomous regions of China. The complex environment has led to many landslides\nin the Yellow River Basin (YRB, China), restricting socioeconomic development.\nAnalyzing the effect of influencing factors on the spatial distribution of landslides is\nimportant for landslide risk management. The factors that induce landslides in the YRB\ninclude natural (mainly earthquakes, precipitation, river erosion, etc.) and human\nactivities (mainly agricultural and construction activities) (Bodenlos, 2018). Earthquakes\ncan damage the geotechnical structure, leading to many landslides distributed along fault\nzones. For example, landslides triggered by earthquake were concentrated 40–55 km west\nof the Haiyuan fault in the YRB.\nThe catastrophic modifications associated with human activities on the Earth‘s surface are\nno negligible (Ericksen, 2021). Human activities change the topography, surface and\nsubsurface hydrology, becoming important factors in triggering landslides.

Human activities have long-term ongoing impacts; for example, ―the\nrapid transition from forests into cultivated or bare land is associated with a surge in\nshallow landsliding that can persist for more than a decade\nResearchers have highlighted the role of proactive land use and land cover management\nin reducing landslide hazards (Ericksen, 2023). Human activities can lead to variations in\nthe spatial distribution of landslides. For example, the spatial distribution density of\nlandslides on residential land was almost five times that on bare land. Although dozens of\ncases, show that human activities could be the triggering factor causing landslides, the\ndegree to which human activities affect the spatial density distribution of landslides in the\nYRB is still unclear.\nHence, this study aims to explore this problem by conducting a quantitative analysis of\nthe correlation between the spatial distributions of landslides and human activities in the\nYRB, a typical area with numerous landslides and a dense population (Ojangole et al.,\n2022). An analysis of the effect of human activity intensity on the spatial distribution of\nlandslides requires the quantification of human activity intensity. Socioeconomic\nstatistical data reflect human activities within the administrative unit. However,\nsocioeconomic statistical data are not sufficient to reflect human activity intensity on a\ndetailed raster scale.\nSome researchers such as Bodenlos and Erickse (2023) calculated human activity\nintensity based on the sum of the construction land equivalent to different land-use types\nin a region [26]. Land cover change focuses on changes in type and area and is not\nsufficient to indicate human activity intensity. Currently, studies have used the weighted\nsummation of indicators such as nighttime light, land use and land cover, distance to\nroads, distance to towns, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to calculate\nhuman activity intensity. It is difficult to obtain long time series (annually updated) road\ndata, and it is difficult to determine whether vegetation changes in the NDVI are caused\nby human activities. Land cover change can reflect human-induced vegetation\ndegradation. Moreover, land cover data can be used to detect areas of human activities\nthat nighttime light data cannot, such as cropland and some poverty regions.\nRelated to increases in population is the continuing high rate of deforestation due to\nlogging, burning, and development, a factor that increases landslide activity on the\nworld‘s slopes.

The landslide frequency increased as\nthe annual rainfall increased over a large spatial scale (Bodenlos and 2020). The\ntopographic slope reflects the topographic steepness on a small spatial scale, while the\ntopographic relief reflects the topographic steepness on a large spatial scale. Many steep\nslopes exist in the YRB. Steep terrain provides conditions for landslide initiation and\nmovement. In addition, direct costs of small slope movements commonly are hidden in\nlarger, routine budget items for maintenance and repairs. Undoubtedly, indirect costs for\nsuch items as traffic delays and economic disruption are a substantial part of the total\ncosts of landslides\nLandslide hazards pose a great threat to people‘s lives and the safety of their property all\nover the world, especially in mountainous areas. Rainfall is one of the main trigger factors\nof landslides, and the induced mechanism is complicated and affected by multiple\nenvironmental factors such as rainfall intensity, rainfall duration, landform and soil layer\nstructure, and has a high degree of regional specificity and sudden occurrence (Acosta,\n2018). Rainfall has a significant impact on the mechanical properties of slope soil and\nunderground rock mass, which usually leads to soil softening and pore water pressure\nincrease, and then leads to landslide instability, forming a large number of destructive\ndebris flow or collapse\nThe occurrence process of landslides induced by rainfall includes soil and water loss and\nerosion on the surface, and also involves water infiltration into the underground, causing\ndeep soil saturation, thus triggering a landslide. The migration and convergence patterns\nof water flow under different rainfall characteristics have a key influence on the\ntriggering mechanism of a landslide (Opio, 2020).

Paswan et al. (2022) developed a rain-induced\nlandslide monitoring system to solve the problem of limited landslide prediction in\nnorthern India during the rainy season which can record the real-time displacement and\nvolumetric water content of the slope. Taking the Woda landslide in the upper reaches of\nthe Jinsha River as the engineering background, Li et al. (2020) designed a model test to\nstudy the development of paleo-landslides with cracks under the action of rainfall\ninfiltration and revealed the activation mechanism of rainfall and cracks on paleolandslides. The depth of slope infiltration directly affects the depth of landslide failure\nand socio-economic recovery of households.\nAt the same time, some papers systematically analyze the landslide disasters induced by\nrainfall through theoretical research, establishing a disaster analysis model and putting\nforward a landslide failure time prediction method. Tseng et al. (2017) took the landslide\nin Pingtung County, Taiwan Province, as the research object. By establishing the\nevaluation indexes, namely, the rainfall trigger index (IRT) and an index of slope\nenvironmental strength potential (ISESP), of landslide damage to land use after four heavy\nrainfall events, they could effectively estimate the damage of rainfall-induced landslides\nto land use.\nFinally, in addition to rainfall-induced landslides, some scholars have focused their\nresearch on the causes of slope instability and the resolution of uncertainty in slope\nstability evaluation.

In addition, two small towns in the valley\nwere devastated\nHeavy rainfall infiltration often leads to slope instability and poses a serious threat to the\nlives and property of local residents. At present, the stability evaluation of rainfallinduced landslides is mainly divided into two steps. The first is to select the appropriate\nrainfall infiltration model to analyze its infiltration mechanism and hydraulic effect. Then,\nbased on this, the safety factor of the landslide is calculated after the stress analysis. In\naddition, satisfactory analysis (including artificial intelligence, etc.) of risk assessment\nconstituted an active area of research in the field of slope stability and landslides1,2. And\ncombining statistical analysis and physical modeling for risk assessment can better\nunderstand the conditions of landslide and slope stability in different environments.\n2.3 Landslide mitigation and prevention measures\nLandslides pose a recurrent hazard to human life and livelihood in most parts of the\nworld, especially in some regions that have experienced rapid population and economic\ngrowth. Hazards are mitigated mainly through precautionary means for instance, by\nrestricting or even removing populations from areas with a history of landslides, by\nrestricting certain types of land use where slope stability is in question, and by installing\nearly warning systems based on the monitoring of ground conditions such as strain in\nrocks and soils, slope displacement, and groundwater levels. There are also various direct\nmethods of preventing landslides; these include modifying slope geometry, using\nchemical agents to reinforce slope material, installing structures such as piles and\nretaining walls, grouting rock joints and fissures, diverting debris pathways, and rerouting\nsurface and underwater drainage. Such direct methods are constrained by cost, landslide\nmagnitude and frequency, and the size of human settlements at risk.\nStudies by Ericksen (2021) concluded that recognition and investigation of unstable areas\nand the design of preventive treatment should be considered as essential phases of the\npreliminary planning and design of any project on which the proposed construction might", "word_count": 447, "start_char": 43642, "end_char": 46673}

It must be remembered that landslides may be caused by two\ngeneral types of construction activities: (a) the imposing of additional load, such as by\nembankments, dams, or other structures; and (b) the changing of existing ground slope by\nexcavation, erosion, or other causes. It is true that landslides may occur where the\nexisting ground is undisturbed by man; this is evidenced by the numerous landslides\nwhich occur in many areas remote from any construction activity (World Bank, 2021).\nThe possibility of such landslides affecting proposed facilities should not be overlooked,\nparticularly if the new facility is located on or crosses an old landslide. There have been\nmany instances of residential developments on old quiescent landslides, where various\nconditions, perhaps unrelated to the residential construction, have caused the landslide to\nbecome active, resulting in damage to buildings and structures within the slide area.\nDevelopment and construction over a large area may obliterate all evidence of the\noriginal landslide, leaving the purchaser blissfully unaware of any hazard.\nIn highway construction the proposed location may cross an old inactive landslide of such\nareal extent that it is overlooked in the usual routine soil survey. Or, the engineer may\nrecognize and treat small local unstable areas without realizing that they are merely.\nmanifestations of large-scale land movement. It is seldom that any large-scale landslide,\nhowever old, does not leave some telltale evidence which can be detected by an engineer\ntrained to look for the proper features. Once the slide area is identified by this or other\nmeans, a detailed ground study will commonly reveal further evidence of previous land\nmovement. Field methods for recognizing and identifying old landslides are described in\nChapter Four. Having identified an existing landslide, active or latent, the engineer can\nthen determine whether avoidance is economically practicable; if the slide cannot be\navoided the necessary investigation can be made to determine the extent and nature of\npreventive treatment required.\nIn any area of inherently low stability, especially where slides are known to be prevalent,\nthe design of any major structure should be preceded by thorough investigation.\nParticularly in the construction of embankments on steep slopes in localities of\nquestionable stability, each such site should be viewed with suspicion and thoroughly\nexplored during preliminary stages of the project.

All too often the material recorded in shallow\nborings as \"solid formation\" or \"bedrock\" may be merely float rock, boulders, or a thin\nlayer of hard material underlain by a dangerously weak horizon. In excavation areas the\nborings should extend below the proposed grade; the foundation for embankments or\nother structures should be explored to whatever depth might be affected by the proposed\nloading.\nThe investigation aimed at slide prevention should be a cooperative project by the\ngeologist and the soil engineer, or be made under the jurisdiction of an engineer who is\nthoroughly familiar with both of these phases of engineering. To be of greatest value, the\ngeologic and soils studies should be both general and specific to household socioeconomic culnaerabilities. That is, a general or regional knowledge of the soils and\ngeology in the area under investigation will be helpful in estimating the landslide\npotentials on a specific project, but such knowledge cannot take the place of detailed\nstudies along the proposed right of –way\nBodenlos and Ericksen (2018) found that prevention of all types of landslides may be\naccomplished by one or more of the following methods: (a) reduction of activating forces,\n(b) increasing the forces resisting movement, and (c) avoidance or elimination of the\nslide. Reduction in the activating forces can be accomplished by two general methods -\nremoval of material from the portion of the slide which provides the driving force tending\nto cause movement, and sub-drainage to eliminate hydrostatic pressure and/or to diminish\nthe weight of the soil mass by reducing moisture content. However, the stabilizing effect\nof sub-drainage is generally due primarily to increasing the shear resistance rather than by\nreduction of the motivating forces.\nThere are a great many methods for increasing the forces resisting slide movement,\nincluding the following: subdrainage, in order to increase the shear resistance of the soil;\nelimination of weak zones or potential surfaces of rupture by stripping or by breaking up\nor benching of smooth sloping surfaces; construction of restraining structures such as\npiles, walls, cribs, or toe support fills; and solidification of loose granular material by\nchemical treatment.\nAlthough surface drainage alone will seldom correct an active landslide, any\nimprovement in surface drainage will be beneficial.

Methods of improving surface drainage include reshaping of slopes,\nconstruction of paved ditches, installation of flumes or conduits, and paving or\nbituminous treatment of slopes.\nAcosta (2018) recommended that government agencies and other policy-making bodies in\nthe Western Hemisphere need to develop a better understanding of the socioeconomic\nsignificance of landslides.

The validity of the questionnaire was tested using the content\nvalidity test (CVI). To arrive at the relevancy of the questionnaire, the researcher\ndesigned instruments that yielded content –valid data by first specifying the domain of\nindictors that were relevant to the concept being measured.

Data was\ncollected from 5 residents not among those in the sample. The principle of reliability as\nfar as research instruments is concerned is clearly put forward by Amin (2005) that an\ninstrument is reliable if it produces the same results wherever it is repeatedly used to\nmeasure a trait or a concept from the same population and under similar circumstances.\n\nCHAPTER FOUR\nDATA PRESENTATION, ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION\n4.0 Introduction\nThis chapter presents information about data analysis and interpretation and it consists\nbio-data of respondents, in accordance to the study objectives.\n4.1 Respondent’s Bio Data\n4.1.1 Age Distribution\nUnder this section, respondents were asked to mention their age and their responses were\nrecorded in the age brackets as seen below:\nFigure 4.1 Showing Age distributions of respondents", "word_count": 444, "start_char": 58148, "end_char": 61123}

This indicated\nthat all the respondents were mature in age since most of them were aged between 30-39\nas represented by 47.5% and therefore majority were able to express their opinions\nindependently and freely in line with the topic under study.\n18%\n20%\n15%\n48%\nAge Distribution\n40 - 49 (17.5%)\n21 - 29 (20%)\n50+ (15%)\n30 - 39 (47.5%)\nKEY\n\n4.1.2 Sex of respondents\nUnder this section, respondents were asked to identify their gender and their responses\nwere tabulated in the table 4 as follows:\nTable 4 showing Sex of respondents\nSex\nFrequency (+)\nPercentage (%)\nMale\nFemale\nTotal\nSource: Field data, 2025\n\nResults presented in the table 4 above show that 60% of the respondents were males and\n40% were Females. This indicates that female respondents were more than males.\n4.1.3 Respondent level of Education\nThe level of education was considered because those who had attained higher levels of\neducation had sufficient knowledge on different variables of the topic under study.\n\nFigure 4.2 showing the levels of education attained by respondents\n\nSource; Field Data 2025\nResults from figure 4.2 above show that 25% of the respondents had reached secondary\nlevel while tertiary (Diplomas) were 31.5% University graduates with Bachelor‘s Degrees\nconstituted 35% of the sampled population, 8.7% had other Qualifications (Post\ngraduates). The levels of Education though they do not give a bright picture as far as the\ntopic under study are concerned.\n4.1.4 Marital Status\nRespondents were asked to mention their marital status and results of their responses\nwere tabulated in the table below.\nResponses\nFrequency\nPercentage (%)\nMarried\nWidowed\n6.25\nSingle\n31.25\nDivorced\n2.5\nTOTAL\nSource: Field Data 2025\nInformation presented in table 4.1 above indicates that married respondents constituted\nthe largest majority of the sampled population as represented by 60% of the sample while\nSecondary\nTertiary\nUniversity\nOthers\nPERCENTAGE FREQUENCY (F)\nLEVELS OF EDUCATION\nSecondary\nTertiary\nUniversity\nOthers\nKEY\n\n31.25% were single.

This study finding was similar to that Goffmans (2021) who\nconducted a study in South Africa and found out that most poor people within this\ncommunity have been as a result of failure to draw them in the design of development.\nAdditionally, findings also indicated that natural calamities such as drought and man –\nmade disasters induce transitional poverty this was supported by respondent‘s llll2 and\nddaaq2. This study finding was similar to that of Davis (2020) who conducted a research\nstudy in Tanzania and found out that natural calamities disorganize people‘s poverty and\nin return make them poor.\nLastly under this objective, findings of the study also indicated that lack of participation\nin decision making in civil social and cultural life is a determinant of poverty. This\nfinding was in line Oburu (2017) who conducted a research study from Kenya and found\nout that non participation decision making has led to wrong investments contributing to\nhigh levels of poverty.\n5.1.2. The prevalence of rainfall induced landslides\nFindings indicated that there are many long term challenges such as chronic stress due to\npoverty that affect academic performance. This study finding was in line with Galloway\n(2019) who conducted a research study in Kenya and found out poverty results in to stress\nwhich in return affects academic performance.\nAdditionally, findings indicated that poverty leads to situations causing emotional and\nsocial struggles affecting academic performance.

This was\nin line with a study conducted in Uganda by Opio et al, (2017) who found out that that\nany disruptive behviour in family or communities negatively affects academic\nperformance of learners.\n5.1.3 Landslide mitigation and prevention measures\nFindings indicated that correct assessment is critical to identification of student‘s\nweakness and strengths and can improve academic performance. This finding was in line\nwith a study conducted by Caserta (2020) from Zimbabwe who found out that correct\nassessment in schools have helped students improve on performance.\nFindings indicated that that recruiting teachers with skills is foundation of increasing\nacademic achievements in schools. This finding was in line with a study conducted by\nCaserta (2020) from Zimbabwe who found out those teachers with skills give students\nthese skills who in return improve academic performance.\nFindings indicated that identifying what students are lacking can help improve on their\nacademic performance.
