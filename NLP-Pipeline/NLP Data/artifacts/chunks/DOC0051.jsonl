A descriptive study was carried out in Zombo\ndistrict with the aim of establishing Church intervention in the lives of children of\nseparated parents in Paidha Parish, Nebbi Diocese. Data was collected by use of\nquestionnaires to gather empirical data.\nThe findings revealed that the children of\nseparated parents in Paidha parish face a number of challenges including: lack of\nbasic needs, lack of parental love and anger, anxiety and emotional stress, poor\nperformance in academics, depressive symptoms, poor health and malnutrition, low\nself-esteem, conduct problems, lack of parental care and guidance.\nThe church is\nfocusing on teaching the principles of safety and welfare of children affected by\nseparation of parents, providing counselling services for separated parents to bring\nthem together, offering prayer and support to children of separated parents and\nproviding mentorship programs for skilling of affected children. The respondents\nsuggested that the church should create supportive environment for children affected\nby the separation of their parents, have active programs such as care for kids of the\ndivorced, active outreach and home visits for families, pastoral and emotional support\nfor the affected children, encouraging heathy communication while allowing Biblebased healing through Bible study. All these would enable the church to grow strong,\nunited, with godly instruction from every home, having holistic integration of faith\nand the homes would be transformed into little gospel outposts.\nThe study\nrecommended\nthat\nthe\nchurch\nshould\noffer\na\nthat\nacknowledges and addresses the pain of separation, while providing a path toward\nhealing by demonstrating healthy relationships and communication within the\nchurch community.", "word_count": 291, "start_char": 10631, "end_char": 12621}

The\nstudy was intended to examine the Church interventions in the lives of the children\nleft out as a result of separated baptized Christian parents. This research was\ndeveloped through reviewing literature sources of previous studies on family issues,\nreviews of existing scholar’s literatures in the library, personal testimony since the\nresearcher is a product of a separated Christian couple. This study was based on some\nBiblical verses like Ephesian 6: 1-4, Psalm 127: 3-5, and Proverbs 22: 6 which says\n“train up a child in the way he should go; when he is old he will not depart from it”.\nThis study primarily focussed on the church’s response to family separation, and the\nconsequences which follow. This chapter presents the background to the study,\nstatement of the problem, scope of the study, the study objectives, theoretical\nframework, justification and significance of the study.\n1.1 Background to the Study\nSeparation and divorce of baptised Christian couples have become increasingly\ncommon in today’s society, affecting millions of children worldwide (Wohm, 2025) .\nFamily separation, the involuntary separation of family members, is a global issue\nwith diverse causes and impacts, particularly affecting children (Willi, 2024). Divorce\nis a present-day reality of society and children of divorced parents are very many.\n\nStatistics show that roughly 40% or more of marriages in the U.S. end in divorce.\nWorldwide it is about 25%\nand rising according to most experts\n(Armand,\n2020) .\nFamily separation in Sub-Saharan Africa is a complex issue with diverse\ndrivers, including poverty, migration, conflict, and natural disasters. However, family\nseparation can also stem from violence, abuse, or neglect. (Vise-Lewis, 2024) . This\nseparation can have devastating consequences, including psychological distress,\nvulnerability to violence and exploitation, and missed educational and medical\nopportunities for children. The term ‘family separation’ encompasses all families\nwhose parents separate, whether they are married or cohabitees (Adam, 2020).\nMany baptised Christian parents have separated and many are in the process of\nseparation living their children without guidance and parental care in our societies\n(Krieken, 2024) . Christian parents going through separation will experience a whole\ncocktail of emotions about their situation, including a fear of what might happen next,\na deep love for their children and worries about money", "word_count": 439, "start_char": 12390, "end_char": 15302}

The sense of failure and loss\nthat accompanies the marital breakdown frequently results in feelings of intense\ndisappointment, bitterness, loneliness, dislocation, anger, sadness, fear, failure, guilt,\nhatred, and depression. While child fostering is a traditional practice, it can also be a\nresponse to these challenges, with children living with extended family members for\nvarious reasons, including access to services or to alleviate family hardship (Karen J.\nel al., 2022).\nThe Church as a family has a great responsibility teaching the Christian families the\ngoodness of family and togetherness in the face of family’s brokenness (Acutis, 2022).\nThe role of the church is to offer a calm space in the midst of the storm and point\nChristians forward to making orderly plans for their future. The church has the work\nof reframing the complexities of an adult relationship breakdown into future-focussed\ndiscussions, so that their children might have the opportunity to thrive (Mark E.R.,\n2016). There are multiple ways in which the church might come alongside those who\nare fragile and fearful and point them towards a restored hope for their future. This\nall comes back to the risk of harm to children from parental conflict and the\nexpectation that the church will lead the charge in calling for safe systems for all who\nseparate, from the moment of separation rather than an application to court.\nThe\nchurch has the responsibility to add its voice and not by promoting separation; but\npromoting child welfare.\nOne of the biggest obstacles teen children of divorce face is the lack of agency or\ncontrol in their life because they are not full-fledged adults and are still dependent", "word_count": 326, "start_char": 15094, "end_char": 17128}

This dependence is a good and natural part\nof growing up; in a dysfunctional system, however, this can make setting and\nmaintaining healthy boundaries difficult. According to Meola, D., (2023), children of\ndivorce who have likely never left their original family system, may find it challenging\nto even identify the dysfunction or the interior wounds it has caused them and may\nalso struggle with a false understanding of forgiveness. Teens are still subject to legal\ncustody arrangements and separating with their parents could be unsuccessful or even\nrisk backlash (Robert E. Emery, 2025).\nThere are vast numbers of children who are growing up with parents in different\nhouseholds, and yet it is not spoken of. A generous interpretation of the church’s\nsilence on family separation is that it has its head in the sand, buried and\nunresponsive due to helplessness, unsure of how to navigate the mess. According\n(Adam, 2020) , a less generous interpretation is that the church is more comfortable\nwearing the clean pressed clothes of judgement, than the grubby rags of grace. If\ngrace but not judgement is the route taken by the church, then it is time to end the\nsilence about family separation where the needs of vulnerable families are best left\nto others (Adam, 2020). The church should be proclaiming from the rooftops to the\nworld at large that children must be protected from harm, physical or psychological,\nwhen parents separate (Barna, 2023) .

They left me with my\ngrandmother who took care of me, introduced me to salvation at that early age of\nfive, took me to school, unfortunately she died when I was in primary two. My father\ngot married to many other women, but none of them thought of taking care of me. I\nstruggled with education up to primary seven, but joining secondary was not possible\nfor me. My dream of studies ended, leaving with an option of joining a group of\nyouths who were doing ‘moshomo’ business (selling roosted meat) within the town of\nPaidha.\nThe experience I passed through during my five years in that business was not good\nfor a child. One that I cannot forget was entering a police cell at the age of 14,\nwhere police took us to their station at midnight as we were busy selling meat for\nour customers who were drinking in a certain bar. All of us were arrested that night,\nI lost all the money I had collected, it was the police commander who took a closer\nlook at me and found that I was too young among the suspects, since it was night\nthey made me spend a night in the cell and released me the next day. When my\nmother heard of this story, she came and looked for me. According to me, I believed\nGod reminded my mother and made her to at least remember me.

My pain always comes back when I see parents separating these days. My\ndesire is that, Christian families should live together until old age and death do them\napart. Understanding the impact of family separation on children is crucial for parents,\neducators, and caregivers. This study focused on the effects of parental separation on\nchild behaviour, explored common behavioural changes, identified influencing factors,\nand offers strategies to help children cope and adjust. I hope the findings of this\nstudy can help in getting lasting solutions to the challenges faced by children of\nseparated parents in our community.\n1.2 Statement of the Problem\nChild labor and child neglect among Christian families in Paidha Parish-Nebbi Diocese,\nChurch of Uganda have been on the rise, especially among children of separated\nChristian parents. This has been attributed to recent increase of street kids. Children\nof separated parents are seen by the communities as failures in life, while most of\nthem have low self-esteem, are malnourished and cannot easily relate with other\nchildren freely.\nAs a result, many are growing with bitterness, without love, lonely\nlife styles and exposed to early sexual relations which put them at a danger of\ncontracting sexually transmitted diseases. The government of Uganda advocates for\nchildren’s rights where all children should be under the guidance and protection of\nthe parents.\nThe church of Uganda has initiated counselling services for affected\nfamilies and children with projects aimed at helping vulnerable children in the\ncommunity. The local leaders have put in polices to reduce street children in towns,\nbut the number of neglected children has been growing due frequent family breakage.", "word_count": 340, "start_char": 20403, "end_char": 22507}

This study will provide information for the different stakeholders, and\nhelp in policy formulation to mitigate the challenges facing Christian families, as well\nas helping children of separated parents within Paidha parish (and beyond).\n1.3.1 General Objective\nTo study Church interventions in the lives of the children of separated parents in\nPaidha Parish, Nebbi Diocese (C.O.U).\n1.3 Specific Objectives of the Study\n1.

This research focuses on exploring the impact of separation on the children\nin Paidha Parish. The study aims to provide some ways the Church can intervene to\nhelp the affected children. This study looks at the role of peace-making in the\ncontext of family separation, and invites an honest reflection on the part played by\nChristian faith communities, in its broadest meaning ‘the church’. The data is\nlimited to Christian communities as the researcher has limited experience of other\nfaith communities.\n1.5.2 Time Scope\nThis is contemporary research. The study was conducted from February to August\n2025 and this implies that the research took about five months to complete. Empirical\ndata was collected from June to July 2025 within Church working hours and in the\ncommunity.\n1.5.3 Geographical Scope\nData was collected from Paidha Parish located in Zombo District, Paidha sub-county,\nNebbi Diocese.

This study was intended to add on the\neffort being made by the Church to help the affected children of Christian separated\nparents and to ensure that the affected children are not left out to the world. The\ninformation yielded by this study is beneficial to the parish administration such as\nParish priests, Lay Readers and any other Church leaders in Paidha Parish.\nThe\nresearcher was a victim of such life, but now is able to study, is married officially in\nChurch with children who are clearly focused and are all in school. We pray that as\nlong as God give us life, they will never experience child neglect and that no other\nchild should pass through that bad experience.\n1.7 Significance of the Study\nChurch involvement to help children of separated parents in Paidha Parish lies in its\nability to connect with the children at a deeper spiritual, social and emotional level.\nThis will make them remain connected to other relatives, Church leaders and even to\nGod. These children will still see hope in life if the Church comes closer to them in\nsuch a time. This connection will help to strengthen their faith, bringing them closer\nto God and promoting a more profound spiritual experience. Above all, the children\nwill know that, they are gift from God, parents just take care of them. This kind of\nknowledge is only possible when the Church can stand to support these abandoned\nchildren.\nAlthough the study was conducted in only 6 Churches in Paidha Parish, in the Diocese\nof Nebbi, its findings will be of great use not only to Paidha Parish, but to the Church", "word_count": 347, "start_char": 25134, "end_char": 27143}

This will also allow the Church as a whole to actively\nparticipate in helping the children of these separated parents, lifting their spirit and\ncreating an atmosphere of love and care. This can enhance the overall spiritual\nexperience and reinforce the teachings of the gospel. The study is also a requirement\nfor the researcher to acquire the Bachelor of Divinity Degree of Uganda Christian\nUniversity.\n1.8 Theoretical Framework\nChurch involvement to help children who are victims of their parents’ separation\nplays a crucial role in building the spiritual lives of these children in Paidha Parish. By\nputting religious themes, Biblical references, and uplifting their self-esteem at the\nfore front, the Church creates an immersive and engaging environment that helps\nindividuals to connect with their faith and inspire them to share their faith with\nothers. Thus, this theoretical framework acknowledges the transformative power of\nChurch involvement\nand its ability to uplift,\nunite, and\nultimately\nfacilitate\nevangelization on the importance of a good family within Paidha Parish.\n1.9 Limitations of the Study.\nSampling bias: The study might only focus on a specific denomination (Anglican\nChurch of Uganda), leaving others in the community with such challenges of\nseparation in marriage.

Current Church Interventions in the Lives of Children of Separated Parents\nThe good news is that God is at the center of our lives through every storm, whether\nit be sickness, divorce, loss of loved ones, loss of income, and many other trials\n(Brownson, 2023) . When our identity and security in life are stripped away, we are\nleft in a place where only God can fill the void. Helping a child cope with divorce is\npossible through faith in God and the belief that He can heal all hurts. Therefore, the\nchurch has the responsibility to show the way and point to God through counselling\nand teachings that restores hope in children of separated parents (Cory B Armad,\n2020). Unfortunately, research shows that 75% of the children who are active in\nchurch during the time of the divorce, say that neither the pastor nor anyone else\nreached out to them during the divorce. For these children going through trauma, the\nchurch was absent, making these children loose trust in the church and the could be\nthe reason why the highest percentage of grown up children least likely to be in the\nchurch as adults today (Lead, 2025). The church can do better than this!\nChurch members are often afraid they will make things worse or they do not know\nwhat to say so, they say and do nothing (Murrow, 2021).

Children of divorce are always missing someone, no\nmatter where they are. When they are with mom, they are missing dad or the other\nway around. They are always navigating two worlds, two value systems, two ways of\nbelieving or if they lose contact with one parent, are internalizing this loss. It is hard\nfor them to be part of a faith community as they travel between parents, and they\noften lose touch. The church can make this easier for the children and their families\nby being the church during this time of grief. The church can accompany them\nthrough their pain, acknowledging that it is beyond comprehension. The church can\nvalidate their suffering and assure them that they are not alone. The church can\nremind them that God will never leave them. The church can help children as they\nfind a new normal and navigate their lives.\nThe possible influence of parental divorce on the religious participation and\nexperiences of offspring—adolescents or young adults has rarely been examined\nsystematically. However, a few studies do conclude that offspring who are raised by\nboth biological parents, as opposed to those raised in single-parent households or\nstepfamilies,\nare\nmore\nlikely\nto\nadopt\ntheir\nparents'\nreligious\npractices\nand\nconvictions (Elizabeth et al., 2024) .

The causes of family separation are varied,\nfor\nparental\nmaltreatment,\nadoption,\nillegal\nimmigration,\nparental incarceration, and Indigenous status (Patricia, (2023). Basically, there are\nthree main leading causes of Christian parent’s separation making them to leave their\nchildren unattended to. These include: lack of genuine faith, misunderstanding of the\npurpose of marriage and poverty.\n2.2.1 Lack of Genuine Faith\nAccording to the research done by Reconciliation Ministry, a local faith-based\norganization in Nebbi diocese, it was found that one of the main reasons why baptized\nChristian parents are separating is lack of genuine faith in Jesus Christ among some\nChristians. This is because many are just baptized Church members without real belief\nin Jesus Christ\n(Reconciliation, 2019) .\nIn other words, they are not born-again\nChristians and this makes them not rooted in their faith. The trials and temptations\nthat come their way put them down. They cannot encourage one another in case of\nany challenge. However, according to me, they could be helped by attending Church\nand even listening to the word of God but since they are unfaithful in their ways of\nlife, the words are just left in the Church. For example, the Church is always teaching\nagainst alcohol, but some parents still go ahead and drink. Others engage in domestic\nviolence among other abuses. The Church advises parents not to fight, yet some of\nthem are always fighting, and as a result they fail to live together for long.", "word_count": 315, "start_char": 32989, "end_char": 34923}

He\nemphasized that marriage is not primarily designed for personal fulfillment, but\nrather to symbolize the relationship between Christ and the Church. When individuals\nprioritize their own happiness above the divine purpose of marriage, they risk\nundermining the foundation of the relationship, potentially leading to separation.\nMeanwhile, he did not notice that many Christians did not even think of wedding.\nActually, majority of the baptized Christians are married outside church. From where\nwill they learn about the purpose of marriage, when many baptized Christians have\nnothing to do with Church marriage? More emphasis should be put on negative cultural\ninfluence because among many people groups in Africa, men are free to marry as\nmuch as many women as they want. That cultural influence has made men unfaithful\nin their marriages. Therefore, they should first be encouraged to go for church\nwedding in order to protect their marriages against separation.\n2.2.3 Poverty\nA family which cannot provide for the basic needs of children can also fail to raise\nthem up (MacArthur, 2002) . But this could be reversed if the Church can offer some\nsolutions to help such parents. Many families are passing through poverty, but they\nare still working together as one family and at the end they make poverty history in\ntheir homes. Here for me I see lack of knowledge of how the parents can come out of\npoverty. Because if one can work, he or she will also be able to provide for his or her\nbasic needs of life.", "word_count": 335, "start_char": 34633, "end_char": 36652}

This is God's ideal, so\nmuch so that, God does not even want unbelievers married to believers to separate\nfrom the marriage either. Paul points out that the believer is no longer bound or a\nslave of the marriage covenant in these circumstances. Wilful desertion renders the\nmarriage covenant null and there is a release from the bond of Holy Matrimony.\nAdultery strikes at the heart of the marriage covenant, so Jesus allows for divorce in\nthose cases. Adultery is such a deep breach of the marriage covenant that untold pain\nand rift are caused in the relationship. However, the principle of forgiveness and trust\nis also present and as long as couples are willing to work through a deep breach of the\nmarriage covenant, there is a real possibility of repair and healing in the marriage.\nGod commands that a wife must not leave her husband, and if she does leave him,\nmust remain single, or else be reconciled to him while the husband must not leave his\nwife (1 Cor.7:10-11). Obviously, separation is not something we should just jump into\nand so, should be avoided whenever possible. There are times, though when it\nbecomes needed, and these are the exceptions to the rule. In these cases, we should\nnot be looking to find a “better option” in someone else, but to find a way to\nreconcile the marriage if possible (Cherith., 2019).\nThe goal of separation is reconciliation, not to go back to ‘the way it was’ because it\ncontributed to where you are now\n(Santiago, 2025) . Use your separation as an\nopportunity to practice new ways of relating to each other and handling conflict.\nTherefore, confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, that you may", "word_count": 361, "start_char": 36473, "end_char": 38520}

The prayer of a righteous person has great power as it is working (James\n5:16). Marital problems are intimate and our natural instinct is to keep quiet. But If\nwe keep our problems a secret, we interfere with God’s primary method of offering\naid through the body of Christ. Jesus very plainly said, “What therefore God has\njoined\ntogether,\nlet\nnot\nman\nseparate”\n(Matthew\n19:6).\nThis\nwas\nsuch\na\nstraightforward statement that many had trouble accepting it. Even His own disciples\nreplied, “If such is the case of a man with his wife, it is better not to marry” (Mathew\n19:10).\n2.4 Effects of the Separation of Parents on their Children’s Life\nThe effects of the separation of parents on their children’s lives are multifaceted,\nencompassing emotional challenges like guilt, anger, anxiety, and a sense of loss, as\nwell as behavioural problems such as aggression and academic decline\n(Millozzi,\n2025) . However, parental handling of the separation, including maintaining stability\nand prioritizing the child's needs, significantly influences outcomes. While many\nchildren are resilient, some face long-term difficulties in relationships and mental\nhealth, with risk factors increasing if parents' conflict and financial stress persist\n(Cowan, 2014) . Children may feel responsible for the separation or worry about a\nparent's absence. They can experience anxiety about the future, changes in their lives,\nand the potential for further abandonment. Feelings of anger toward one or both\nparents and sadness over the loss of their family structure are common. Younger\nchildren may show signs of regression, such as bedwetting, sleep disturbances, or\nincreased weepiness.", "word_count": 321, "start_char": 38189, "end_char": 40198}

However, the impact varies\ndepending on factors like the level of parental conflict, the quality of the parentchild relationship, and the support systems in place. With appropriate interventions\nand support, many children can adapt and thrive despite the initial challenges posed\nby separation.\nSeparation can affect adult children's ability to form stable and trusting intimate\nrelationships and the effects on mental health can persist into adulthood, increasing\nthe risk of psychological problems\n(Milrod et al., 2024) . Children from divorced\nfamilies are at higher risk of experiencing their own family instability and separation\nin adulthood. High levels of conflict between parents during and after separation are\ndetrimental to children's adjustment. Children are at greater risk when parents\ncriticize each other or put the child in the middle of their disputes.

Strategies include providing secure environments, teaching children to value\nboth parents, reassuring them they are not to blame, and connecting families with\nprofessional help when needed. Many churches provide or refer families to faithbased counselling services that address the emotional wounds, anxiety, and anger\nthat children often experience after a separation (Eng.Ronney, 2025).\nPrayer offers comfort and strength to both children and parents, helping them\nnavigate feelings of confusion and sadness (Miller-McLemore, 2019) .

(2019), prayer offers comfort and strength to both children and\nparents, helping them navigate feelings of confusion and sadness and therefore, some\nchurches organized or facilitated support groups for children and parents to share\nexperiences and learn coping mechanisms within a faith-based community.

According to 1\nCorinthians7:10-11, God commands that a wife must not leave her husband, and if she\ndoes leave him, must remain single, or else be reconciled to him while the husband\nmust not leave his wife. This clear illustrate that reconciliation is key for a successful\nfamily and the church. According to Cherith, 2019, the church has the responsibility\nto avoid separation of family as much as possible for it to stay strong and united. The\nchurch shouldn’t be looking to find a “better option” in someone else, but to find a\nway to reconcile the marriage if possible as suggested by Cherith, (2019).\nAccording to Santiago, (2025), the goal of the church is always reconciliation of family\nand bringing parents together to avoid divorce.

From creation, God intended family to\nbe a place of nurture, love, and continuity of faith (Genesis 2:18–24). Yet, in many\ncommunities today, including Paidha Parish in Nebbi Diocese, families experience\nbreakdown through separation, leaving children vulnerable. These children often\ncarry deep wounds of rejection, insecurity, and stigma.\nThe Church of Uganda, as part of the Body of Christ, is called to respond theologically\nand pastorally. This reflection considers church intervention in the lives of children of\nseparated parents, drawing insight from the Old Testament, New Testament, Church\nHistory, and the Modern Church.\n5.1 Old Testament Perspective: God’s Care for the Vulnerable\nThe Old Testament consistently emphasizes God’s concern for those made vulnerable\nby family or social breakdown. Children of separated parents in Paidha Parish can be\nunderstood in the same category as the fatherless, the orphan, and the widow. God\ncommands Israel: “You shall not mistreat any widow or fatherless child” (Exodus\n22:22). Similarly, “He defends the cause of the fatherless and the widow, and loves\nthe foreigner residing among you” (Deuteronomy 10:18).", "word_count": 227, "start_char": 67442, "end_char": 68916}

In Isaiah’s prophecy, God commands: “Learn to do right; seek justice.\nDefend the oppressed. Take up the cause of the fatherless” (Isaiah 1:17).\nThese texts demonstrate that care for vulnerable children is not a matter of choice\nbut of obedience to God’s covenant. Thus, the Old Testament challenges the church\nin Nebbi Diocese to see children of separated parents as those under God’s special\nprotection.\n5.2 New Testament Perspective: Jesus and the New Family of God\nIn the New Testament, Jesus places children at the very centre of the Kingdom of God.\n“Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of\nheaven belongs to such as these” (Matthew 19:14). This affirmation speaks directly to\nchildren who may feel rejected by parental separation.\nJesus redefines family beyond biological ties: “Whoever does God’s will is my brother\nand sister and mother” (Mark 3:35). This teaching assures children that the church, as\nthe household of God, is their true family. Paul affirms this when he writes: “You are\nno longer foreigners and strangers, but fellow citizens with God’s people and also\nmembers of his household” (Ephesians 2:19).\nThe parable of the lost sheep (Luke 15:3–7) and the parable of the prodigal son (Luke\n15:11–32) reveal God’s concern for those who are lost or broken. In the same way, the\nchurch must actively seek out and embrace children of separated parents, reminding\nthem of their dignity in Christ.", "word_count": 313, "start_char": 68561, "end_char": 70460}

This\napostolic teaching illustrates how the church has historically understood care for the\nvulnerable as integral to true Christian faith.\nThus, from the earliest days, the church’s identity has been bound to compassionate\ncare. Children of separated parents today fall within this biblical mandate.\n5.4 Modern Church: Mission in the Context of Paidha Parish\nIn the modern church, particularly in Paidha Parish, Nebbi Diocese, the biblical\nmandate remains clear. Children of separated parents face emotional trauma,\neconomic hardship, and social stigma. The church’s mission must reflect Christ’s\nholistic love through:\nPastoral Care – Offering counseling and guidance in the spirit of the Good Shepherd\n(John 10:11).\nBelonging in God’s Family – Strengthening children’s ministries to affirm the truth that\n“we are all one in Christ Jesus” (Galatians 3:28).\nPractical Support – Living out James 2:17, which teaches that “faith by itself, if it is\nnot accompanied by action, is dead.”\n\nAdvocacy for Justice – Following Micah 6:8, to act justly and love mercy in defending\nchildren’s rights.\nSpiritual Formation – Teaching children the promise that “though my father and\nmother forsake me, the Lord will receive me” (Psalm 27:10).\nBy doing this, the church embodies God’s mission of healing and reconciliation in the\nlocal context.\n5.5 Conclusion\nFrom the Old Testament command to defend the fatherless, to Jesus’ radical embrace\nof children in the New Testament, to the early church’s witness in Acts, the\nconsistent biblical message is clear: God calls His people to care for vulnerable\nchildren.\nFor the modern church in Paidha Parish, Nebbi Diocese, this means intentional\npastoral, spiritual, and practical interventions that restore dignity and hope for\nchildren of separated parents. The church must embody God’s promise as “a father to\nthe fatherless” (Psalm 68:5) and stand as a living family where every child finds\nbelonging in Christ.", "word_count": 436, "start_char": 70173, "end_char": 72882}
