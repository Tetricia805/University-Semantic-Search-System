The Basalt\nrocks used in this study were collected and crushed from Mugarama site in Kibaale\nDistrict to form powder. The physical and mechanical properties of concrete ingredient\nsuch as sand and coarse aggregates were determined and these included sieve analysis,\nACV, AIV, moisture content, flakiness index, specific gravity and water absorption. The\nproperties of the BRP were determined by carrying out different tests such as sieve\nanalysis, x-ray fluorescence, water absorption with results provided in chapter 4 below.\nThe control mix of a cement content 430Kg, fine aggregate, 675kg, water 206kg and\ncoarse aggregate of 1007kg. The percentage replacement of cement with BRP varied\nfrom 0, 10,15,20,25 and 30%. Concrete cubes of sizes 150mmx150mmx150mm were\ncasted and evaluated for 7 and 28 days.\nIncrease in percentage replacement of cement with BRP showed an increase in\ncompressive strength from 0% to 15% attaining the highest value of 43.9Mpa and then\ngradually decreased with increasing percentage replacement of BRP. The setting time\ndecreases while workability increases, with an increase in BRP percentage\nreplacement. The compressive strength, setting time and workability were all lying in\nthe acceptable ranges according to literature, 43.9Mpa, 7.7hrs and 87mm respectively.\nThe 15% is the optimum percentage replacement since its strength is well above the\ncontrol concrete of 40.5Mpa, and target strength of 35.1Mpa.\n\nii\n\nDECLARATION\nI, Wayomirwoth Kelly hereby declare that this is my original work, is not plagiarized\nand has not been submitted to any other institution for any award\nWAYOMIRWOTH KELLY\nS18B32/802\nSignature .......................................\n\nDate: .......................................\n\niii\n\nAPPROVAL\nThis final year research project report has been submitted by WAYOMIRWOTH KELLY to\nthe department of Engineering and Environment at Uganda Christian University for\nexamination with my approval as the university supervisor\nSIGNATURE .............................................\n\nDATE: ..........................................\nMR NATHAN NATUKUNDA\n(ACADEMIC SUPERVISOR)\n\niv", "word_count": 396, "start_char": 0, "end_char": 2794}

Concrete is a mixture of majorly; coarse aggregates, sand, cement and\nwater (Azad, 2019).\nProduction of concrete is associated with lots of environmental concerns due to the\nover consumption of raw materials, energy and labor. Cement as one of the key\ningredients in concrete, consumes a lot of energy during its production while still\nreleasing about 0.55-0.94 tons of carbon dioxide emissions per ton, possessing about 7%\nof the world’s total carbon dioxide emissions (Li, 2022). Several researches have been\ncarried out to find alternatives or supplements to cement in concrete, especially on\nnatural pozzolans like fly ash, silica fume, blast furnace slag, volcanic pumice etc. Also,\nmore research investigated agricultural waste like coconut, maize, rice, sugar cane and\nindustrial by products like basalt rock powder, waste foundry sand etc as Supplementary\nCementitious Materials (SCM) (Qiao, 2019). But with all these studies, there’s limited\nknowledge regarding the potential use of Basalt rock powder in concrete production,\ngiven that little have been investigated towards achieving the appropriate particle size\nand optimum percentage for partial cement replacement.\nBasalt rock is an igneous rock that covers about 30% of the Earth’s surface making it\nthe most rock, therefore its volume is abundant as it is available in most continents.\nThis igneous rock is a dark colored, fine grained, rock that forms as a result of volcanic", "word_count": 259, "start_char": 14283, "end_char": 15946}

The dark\ncolor is due to the presence of the minerals such as plagioclase, pyroxene (augite),\nolivine with possible minor glass. Basalt rocks are largely found in various parts of\nUganda including Mbale district, Kibaale district, Kisoro district etc, and can be\nidentified by their black or grayish-black rock color, fine and even grain texture with\nno crystals or minerals discernible to the naked eye.\nBasalt rock has been used in the construction industry for various applications but\nmajorly as aggregates due to its availability, sustainability, durability and strength\nproperties (Qiao, 2019). Basalt rock powder (BRP) has a large specific surface area and\nhigh SiO2 and Al2O3 contents thus when used as a supplementary cementitious\nmaterial, it can have a positive impact on the mechanical properties. This is because\nbasalt rock powder forms a gel on hydration, when Calcium Oxide from Cement reacts\nwith SiO2, resulting into nucleation of the C-S-H and strengthening the bond between\nbasalt and the matrix (Li, 2022). This research will investigate the optimum percentage\nof Basalt Rock Powder that can be used to partially replace cement in concrete, to\nproduce a high-performance concrete which is economical and environmentally\nsustainable.\n1.2 PROBLEM STATEMENT\nCement production contributed to the release of about 2.3 gigatons of carbon dioxide\nin 2019, possessing about 7% of the world’s total carbon dioxide emissions. This is\nexpected to reach 4.83 billion metric tons in 2030. A solution for decreasing the CO2\nemissions determined by the cement industry is its replacement by supplementary\ncementitious materials - SCMs, (Adrian, 2022).", "word_count": 316, "start_char": 15683, "end_char": 17681}

A partial\nreplacement of cement with basalt rock powder, will not only reduce cost in concrete\nproduction, decrease gas emissions leading to greenhouse effect, minimize harmful\nenvironmental impacts, reduce the consumption of natural resources and the energy\nbut also improve the compressive strength of concrete (Qiao, 2019).\nA study shows that 10 to 25% basalt rock is appropriate for replacing Portland cement\npartially, while still another study indicates that the optimum fine aggregate\nreplacement is about 20–30% and it depends more on rock dust fineness. So, there’s\nneed to carry out a profound-research to establish the optimum ratio for partial\nreplacement of cement in concrete with regard to the fineness of the basalt rock\npowder. This will help to produce a high-performance concrete with improved strength\nproperties, economically cheap and environmentally friendly.\n1.3 OBJECTIVES OF STUDY\n1.31 MAIN OBJECTIVE\nTo investigate the use of Basalt Rock Powder in the Partial replacement of\ncement in concrete.\n1.3.2 SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES\n1.

Also, basalt can be\nutilized in its natural state depending on its grain size for cementitious composites, due\nto its influence as a pozzolanic active component (Scheinherrová, 2022)\nThis study therefore investigates the partial replacement of cement with a natural\npozzolanic material to improve the strength of concrete while providing a natural\nalternative for cement, thereby reducing carbon emission, energy consumption and\nnatural resource depletion among others.", "word_count": 437, "start_char": 17462, "end_char": 20402}

Concrete is used in the construction field in foundation,\nconstructing roads, making pavements, parking structures, overpasses, and block walls\namong others.\nConcrete as a material consists at least 75% of aggregate by volume and is obtained\nfrom a proportionate mixture of cement binder, sand, aggregates, and water. Sand,\ncement and water forms a paste which hardens as result of chemical reaction between\nthe water and cement. The formed paste binds the aggregates together into a solid\nrock. The strength and durability of concrete is dependent on the properties of its\ningredients, mix proportions, method of compaction with other factors and also control\nduring placing, compaction and curing.\nThe properties of concrete are divided into two; fresh concrete properties and harden\nconcrete properties.\nFresh concrete properties: These include workability, segregation and bleeding. To\ndetermine the workability of fresh concrete tests such as slump tests, compaction\nfactor test and flow table test are carried out and this helps to determine the strength\nand durability of concrete.\nHarden concrete properties: various tests are carried out on hardened concrete to\ndetermine properties such as strength, durability, and permeability.

Ingredients such as lime (CaO), silica (SiO2), aluminium oxide\n(Al203) and iron oxide (Fe2O3) are heated at very high temperatures to form a rock like\nsubstance which is ground into fine powder called Cement. Cement it itself is not a\nbinder, but develops the binding property as a result of hydration from chemical\nreactions between cement minerals and water. (Proxald. 2015). The most common\ntype of cement is known as Portland cement, which is used as an ingredient in concrete\nproduction (Kaushik, 2004). There are majorly two types of Portland cement, namely;\nOrdinary Portland Cement (OPC) which is produced by an automated, dry manufacturing\nprocess under strict quality assurance at all manufacturing stages and Portland\nPozzolana Cement (PPC) which is produced by using a pozzolanic material as the main\ningredients used in the preparation and should not exceed 30% of the total OPC (Kim,\n2010). Cement is classified into five classes according to ASTM C 150 from Type I to\nType V depending on the purpose and use in the building and construction industry.\nOrdinary Portland Cement (OPC)\nThis is produced by an automated, dry manufacturing process under strict quality\nassurance at all stages. It comes in a range of specifications to suit a number of\nconditions and applications such as dry lean mixes, general purpose ready mixes, high\nstrength pre-cast and pre-stressed concrete (Ashok et al., 2016).", "word_count": 321, "start_char": 25785, "end_char": 27836}

The main compounds in the clinker are\nCao, SiO2, Al2O3 and Fe2O3, which account for 61-67%, 19-23%, 2.5-6% and 0-06% of\nthe mass of the clinker respectively (Aslantas, 2010).

Water\ngreatly affects the workability of concrete which largely depends on the water/ratio;\nan increase in the sizes of aggregates, a reduction in water/cement ration and use of\nrounded aggregates will reduce the water demand, thus leading to a reduced slump.\nFor strong and workable concrete, the water/cement ration should be balance, since\ntoo much water reduces concrete strength, while overly reduced water makes the\nconcrete unworkable (Kosmatka, 2014).\n2.1.2 BASALT ROCK POWDER\nThis is a fine-grained material that is obtained by crushing basalt rocks and is typically\ndark in color, ranging from black to dark gray, due to its high content of dark-colored\nminerals such as pyroxene and olivine.

A study investigated the feasibility of using BRP and Superfine\nsand as partial replacement for Portland cement and artificial sand in mortar. The\nresults showed that the use of BRP and superfine sand as partial replacement materials\nfor Portland cement and artificial sand respecting in cement mortar is feasible (Qiao,\n2019). Another study investigated the effect of basalt powder on hydration, rheology\nand strength development of cement past. The results showed that the use of basalt\npowder can improve the strength development of cement paste (Li, 2022). Also,\nanother study investigated the effect of Basalt Powder on the properties of Cement\nComposites. The results obtained show that the basaltic powder has a positive effect\n\non the consistency of fresh cement composites and strength of the hardened composite\n(Unčík, 2013). Also, when carried out on Basalt powder as a supplementary\ncementitious material in cement past for CCS wells, due to basalt powder\ncharacteristics, the chemical resistance increased resistance for formulation of cement\nhaving low Basalt powder quantity as a result of porosity and permeability reducing,\ndue to the gaps getting filled in the network of porous cement (Ponzi, 2021). According\nto Dobiszewska M (2018), the addition of waste basalt powder as a replacement of sand\nin concrete improves its compressive and flexural strength due to the filler effect, and\nalso results in a denser and stronger interfacial transition zone microstructure. Also,\naccording to the microstructural analysis, the presence of basalt powder in concrete\nmixes is beneficial for cement hydration products and basalt powder substituted\nconcretes have lower porosity within the interfacial transitional zone (Dobiszewska,\n2020).\n2.3 RESEARCH GAP\nSeveral researches have been carried out on basalt rock powder as a partial\nreplacement of cement in cement mortar and partial replacement of sand in concrete\nand lots of evidence have been provided for the improvements in strength.

This is used in determining the distribution of\naggregate particles by size in order to comply with the design, production control\nrequirements and verification specifications. This test ensures the separation of fine\nparticles with the coarse ones during test process using various sieves sizes for the\nsample material.

It can therefore be used as the measure of workability of sand according to\nASTM (ASTM C33 1954). Fineness modulus can be computed as 600 minus total sums of\ncumulative percentages retained on sieve and then divided by 100. The fineness\nmodulus is also used in mix design since the gradation of fine aggregates determines\nthe density and permeability of the concrete, high fineness modulus implies low density\nand low permeability of concrete.

According to BS 8122 PART 110, ACV\ngives the relative measure of crushing under an increasing compressive load.

Lower ACV implies the\naggregates are stronger, which indicates that the aggregates are more durable with\nlonger service life thus very valuable performance. The crushing value should not\nexceed 25% for construction as per standard BS 812 PART 110: 1990. If the ACV is 25 or\nmore, the result may be anomalous and thus the ten percent fines value should be\ndetermined instead.\n4.3 AGGREGATE IMPACT VALUE (AIV) TEST ON COARSE AGGREGATES\nThe ACV test is used to determine the aggregate impact value which gives a relative\nmeasure of the resistance of an aggregate of sudden shock or impact, which in some\naggregates differ from their resistance to a slowly applied compressive load. The AIV is\nobtained by calculating the percentage loss of weight particles passing 2.36 mm sieve\nby the application of load by means of 15 blows of standard hammer and drop under\nspecified condition.\n\nTable 5: AIV mean value calculations for coarse aggregates\n\nAs per BS 812 PART 110: 1990 and the above specifications, the AIV for concrete in nonwearing areas is to be less than 45% by weight and 25% in wearing areas say runaways.\nFrom the results above of coarse aggregates, a mean value of 16.4 % was obtained and\nthus the coarse aggregates are suitable for use in concrete.\n4.1 LOS ANGELES ABRASION VALUE (LAAV) TEST ON COARSE AGGREGATES\nTable 6: LAAV calculations for coarse aggregates\n\nLAAV of 19.6% suggests a strong resistance to abrasion. The LAAV represents the\npercentage of material lost by weight during the abrasion test. A higher LAAV indicates\n\na greater abrasion of the aggregate and by extension, potentially reduced durability of\nthe concrete. If the LAAV exceeds allowable limits, adjustments can be made in the\naggregate selection or mix design to improve resistance\n4.2 RELATIVE DENSITY AND WATER ABSORPTION FOR COARSE AGGREGATES\nTable 7: The calculated relative density and water absorption values", "word_count": 378, "start_char": 52313, "end_char": 54599}

According to the test carried out, little quantity of water is\nabsorbed by the coarse aggregates as shown in results that is 0.36% thus meaning\nwater absorption consideration can be neglected in the mix design, as per BS 882: Part\n2 1995, the standard water absorption should less than 2%\nRelative density test is carried out as a measure of quality for coarse aggregates and it\nis also denotes a measure of the specific gravity of the aggregates\nThe apparent specific gravity of the commonly used rocks ranges from 2.6 to 2.7 as per\nstandards BS 882: 1992.

As the percentage of BRP increases from 0% to 30%, the\nslump values also show a general increasing trend. A slump value of 81mm for 0% BRP\nsuggests a moderately stiff concrete mix, whereas higher slump values for BRP\nincorporated mixes indicated improved workability.\nThis increase in slump indicates that the addition of BRP enhances the workability of\nthe concrete mixes, potentially due to the finer particle size and smoother surface\ntexture of the BRP compared to cement particles according to Li, 2022\nStandard Deviation\nThe standard deviation is the average amount of variability in your dataset, telling us\non average how far each value lies from the mean.
