At the same time, heavy metals such\nas lead (Pb2+) and copper (Cu2+) are classified as hazards of the highest order due to their\ntoxic nature, persistence, and bioaccumulation (Tchobanoglous et al., 2014). A study on\nwater quality in Kyabalogo Village, Nakisunga Sub-county, Mukono District, Uganda,\nindicated the existence of Pb and Cu in the spring water exceeding the tolerable limits\nfor drinking water. Therefore, the water cannot be used in households without prior\npurification.\nThe current work is focused on the application of natural zeolite as an inexpensive and\neffective adsorbent to purify the spring groundwater by removing Pb2+ and Cu2+ at the\nhousehold level. Previous literature shows that divalent heavy metals can be taken away\nby zeolites by 80–95% via ion-exchange processes, where the ions of the heavy metals\nPb2+ and Cu2+ in the solution replace the cations (e.g., Na+, K+, Ca2+) that are in the\nzeolite lattice (Misaelides, 2011). The results of this research work are expected to\nprovide a cheap and an eco-friendly approach solution for the rural water treatment\ncommunity. (Wang & Peng, 2010).\n\nii\n\nDECLARATION\nI, LUBULWA IVAN JOSEPH hereby declare that this final year research project entitled;\nUse of modified zeolites in ground water treatment at household level a case study of\nKyabalogo Village, Nakisunga Sub-County is mine.

Major contributors to the pollution of both surface water\nand groundwater are industrial discharges, domestic sewage, agricultural runoff, and\nchanges in the environment (WHO, 2024). In many parts of the world that are still\ndeveloping, groundwater that people rely on for drinking purposes is slowly discovered\nto contain harmful inorganic pollutants and especially heavy metals such as lead (Pb),\ncopper (Cu), iron (Fe), and cadmium (Cd). These metals are unyielding, nondegradable, and their presence even in minuscule amounts causes a very serious health\nrisk (Tchobanoglous et al., 2014).\n\nBy the year 2035, the global population increase is estimated to be around 7.9 billion,\nand consequently, the water crisis is to be more severe than it is now, particularly in\nrural areas where the supply of water treatment facilities is limited (WHO, 2024). The\nconventional use of filtration by households such as plain sand filtration, membrane\nfilters, and biochar filters has been found to be inadequate as poor adsorption capacity\nand large variation in maintaining the level of metals below that of the drinking water\nstandard have been cited as the causes.\n\nAmong the various treatment methods available, the one based on adsorption has\ngained recognition as the most efficient and at the same time the least expensive\nsolution to heavy metals removal. Natural zeolites in particular are the most popular\nones, boasting the property of having the highest cation-exchange capacity, micropore\nstructure, and strong affinity for the divalent metal ion such as Pb2+ and Cu2+ (Wang &\nPeng, 2010). In this manner, zeolites can swap their cations (Na+, Ca2+, K+) for those of\ntoxic metals, significantly reducing the concentration of metals in contaminated water\nwithin minutes (Misaelides, 2011).\nThis research focuses on the purification of Kyabalogo Village, Nakisunga Sub- by using\nmodified zeolites as an adsorbent for household drinking water.\n\n1.2 PROBLEM STATEMENT\nThe major sources of water in Uganda are underground, and in addition to that, natural\nsprings are also used for domestic purposes, drinking water, and small-scale economic\nactivities. In Kyabalogo village, Nakisunga sub-county, the spring water is the main\nsource of water since it is free, easy to access, and available all year round. However,\nhuman activities such as improper waste disposal, agricultural runoff, and unregulated\nland use around these water sources have deteriorated the quality of the water\nsignificantly (WHO, 2024).", "word_count": 424, "start_char": 13498, "end_char": 16289}

Furthermore, with the presence of pathogens in the water,\nthe risk to public health is even greater, with fecal coliforms being detected in the range\nof 1000 CFU/100 mL (Nzanzu et al., 2022).\n\nA good number of the Kyabalogo Village residents are elderly or low-income and thus\ncannot afford the piped water from the National Water and Sewerage Corporation\n(NWSC). They, therefore, rely on spring water that is likely to be contaminated by human\nactivities and groundwater infiltration of heavy metals. Hence, the need for developing\ninexpensive household-scale treatment systems is very critical.\n\nPopular household filtration systems like sand filters, membrane filters, and cloth\nfiltration have not shown high efficiency in the removal of dissolved heavy metals. On\nthe other hand, natural zeolites are known for their high cation-exchange capacity and\ngreat attraction to divalent heavy metals like Pb2+ and Cu2+, which makes the\n1.3 OBJECTIVES OF STUDY\n1.3.1 Main objective\nTo use modified zeolites in water treatment at household level a case study of Kyabalogo\nvillage, Nakisunga Sub-County\n\n1.3.2 Specific objectives\n1.

The main reasons for\ntheir high efficiency are their high cation-exchange capacity, porous structure, and\nexcellent affinity for divalent metal ions. Clinoptilolite, a natural zeolite, is the most\ncommonly used mineral as it is regarded as a very low-cost, eco-friendly, and selective\nadsorbent for toxic metals in drinking water (Sprynskyy et al., 2006; Wang & Peng, 2010).\n\nIon exchange occurs mainly as a mechanism of sorption whereby metal ions in solution\ndisplace the weaker cationic exchangeable ones (Na+, K+, Ca2+) of the zeolite. This\nphenomenon can be illustrated as follows:\n\n2(Z–Na)+Pb2+→(Z)2–Pb+2Na+\n\n2(Z–Na)+Cu2+→(Z)2–Cu+2Na+\nZeolites additionally eliminate heavy metals through surface adsorption and\ncomplexation, thus making them multifunctional. As a result of their high efficiency,\nsimplicity, low operational cost, and compatibility with household water treatment,\nadsorption has been identified as the preferred method over such treatments as\nmembrane filtration, precipitation, and solvent extraction (Foo & Hameed, 2010).\n\nAmong the possible adsorbents, zeolites win due to their very large specific surface area,\npermanent negative framework charge, natural occurrence, and water resistance. It has\nbeen proven on many occasions that zeolites possess an extremely strong selection for\nPb2+ and Cu2+ ions even when the competing ions are Ca2+ and Mg2+ (Inglezakis & Zorpas,\n2012). Thus, they could very well be applied in the treatment of natural groundwater in\nrural areas like Mukono, where heavy metals may be above the stipulated limits.\n\nTo sum up, zeolites, with their combination of low cost, selectivity, and high efficacy,\nbecome the ideal option for household water treatment. They are distinguished by their\ndual Roman Catholic and Orthodox mechanisms of ion-exchange and adsorption with\nnatural availability, which are the best choice for Pb2+ and Cu2+ removal from spring\ngroundwater and as a natural resource that is readily available in the rocks of Mbale\nproven performance.\n1.6 GEOGRAPHICAL SCOPE\nThe study focused on three springs located in Kyabalogo village, Nakisunga Sub-County,\nCentral Region (0034/40.0// N, 60000/30.0// E).

Nevertheless, the scientific community\nhas come to the conclusion that heavy metals are those elements with a density greater\nthan 5g/cm3 (Ali & Khan, 2018). With respect to this investigation, copper with an\nestimated density of around 8.9g/cm3 and iron with 7.9g/cm3 can definitely be\nclassified as heavy metals.\n2.2 Copper\nCopper (Cu) is an indispensable trace element that functions as a cofactor for various\nenzymes, participates in the formation of connective tissues, strengthens the immune\nsystem, and takes part in the processing of nervous impulses (ICA, n.d). Its occurrence\nin food as well as the low levels in many water sources makes copper deficiency rare,\nif not impossible, in the general population, the exception being individuals with\ndefective copper metabolism.", "word_count": 323, "start_char": 20781, "end_char": 22895}

To prevent health issues\nlike gastrointestinal irritation, nausea, and complications in patients with Wilson's\ndisease (WHO, 2017), the WHO sets a limit of 2.0 mg/L as the maximum allowable\nconcentration in drinking water. Furthermore, copper at concentrations exceeding 2.5\nmg/L will alter the taste and color of the water, making it less acceptable.\nCopper contamination in groundwater systems is a common issue caused by not only\ngeological sources but also leaching of contaminated soils, agricultural chemicals, and\nimproper waste disposal. In contrast to the corroding copper pipes being the main\nsource of contamination in piped distribution systems, rural groundwater pollution may\ncome from weathered rocks, mining residues and human wastes (Zhou et al., 2024).\nHousehold water with excessive copper has the potential to cause laundry staining at\nthe concentration of more than 1 mg/L and pipe discoloration (WHO, 2017). Traditional\nmethods of household filtration do not remove dissolved Cu2+ ions, as copper is not\neasily removed through simple sand filtration or chlorination. While more advanced\ntechniques like chemical precipitation, coagulation, membrane and ion exchange have\nbeen proven effective, they also tend to be expensive and complicated for low-income\nrural households.\nAdsorption, particularly the application of natural zeolites, is a cheap and an efficient\nalternative. The high cation-exchange capacity of zeolites and their ability to\nselectively bind Cu2+ ions make them ideal for the purification of contaminated\n\ngroundwater in the home setting.\n2.3 Lead\nLead is a metal that is very toxic and has no beneficial role in the human body. The case\nof lead is different from that of trace elements: Even the least exposure might lead to\nhuge health impacts, and this is especially so for vulnerable groups like children and\npregnant women (WHO, 2021). According to the WHO, lead is a Group 2A probable human\ncarcinogen, and it is very strictly stated that no amount of lead exposure is considered\nto be safe (WHO, 2021). Thus, the WHO guideline value for lead in drinking water is fixed\nat 0.01 mg/L.", "word_count": 391, "start_char": 22684, "end_char": 25174}
{"chunk_id": "DOC0097__00009", "doc_id": "DOC0097", "chunk_index": 9, "text": "ccording to the WHO, lead is a Group 2A probable human\ncarcinogen, and it is very strictly stated that no amount of lead exposure is considered\nto be safe (WHO, 2021).T\n\nhus, the WHO guideline value for lead in drinking water is fixed\nat 0.01 mg/L.\n\nA vast pool of scientific studies has all pointed to the same conclusion that the\nconsumption of lead-contaminated water even at levels of less than 0.1 mg/L can have\nextreme effects on brain development, general health, and even physiology of the\norganism. Lead diminishes the amount of hemoglobin made, disrupts enzyme activity and\nbuilds up in the bones and soft tissues of the body with time (Tchounwou et al., 2012).\nIn children, lead presence in drinking water below the level of 0.05 mg/L is blamed for\nlowering IQ, hindering cognitive skills, creating behavior series, and causing growth to\nstop (Lanphear et al., 2018). Adults suffering from the similar case might face the\nproblems of high blood pressure, kidney malfunction, infertility, and heart attack (Flora\net al., 2012).\nEven higher amounts of lead in drinking water, and say, those found in rural groundwater\nand city outskirts, springs, are huge risks. Rahman et al. (2023) mention fatigue,\n\nabdominal pain, memory loss, muscle weakness, and anemia as symptoms of chronic lead\nexposure. The long-term lead deposit causes neurodegeneration, seizures, and organ\nfailure. Health risks depend on various factors like age, nutrition, socio-economic status,\nand exposure time (WHO, 2021).\nGroundwater percolation varies a lot, nevertheless, the major contributors are the\ngeological weathering, lead plumbing corrosion, wrong batteries and paints disposal,\nand agricultural or industrial runoff (Kumar et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2024). For\nexample, a rural Ugandan community like Kyabalogo Village in Nakisunga Sub-County\nfrequently experiences lead pollution through geological layers, soil leaching\ncontamination. These sources usually cause contamination that is more direct and\npersistent than contamination resulting from isolated human activities.\nAs per the Uganda Standards (US EAS 2014), the maximum allowable limit for lead in\npotable water is 0.01 mg/L, which is in line with WHO recommendations. Lead levels\nbeyond this point are not only harmful to health but also signify that the groundwater\nhas been contaminated on a larger scale.\nConsidering the great health risks of lead even at low levels in drinking water, it is critical\nthat proper treatments are implemented. Among the adsorption-based methods, one\nespecially using natural zeolites has the potential to remove Pb2+ from the water\nselectively, and that is due to its high cation-exchange capacity and strong affinity for\ndivalent heavy metals (Wang & Peng, 2010; Misaelides, 2011).", "word_count": 429, "start_char": 24926, "end_char": 27695}

Thus, the search is\non for more affordable methods in the removal of heavy metals from water in places\nlike Uganda.\nOther limitations of the conventional methods according to Gahrouei, (2024) and\nSenanu (2023) are in Table 1 below.\n\nTable 1: Limitations of the conventional methods of heavy metal removal in water\n(Source: Senanu, 2023; Gahrouei, 2024; Wang et al,2025\nMethod of treatment\nLimitations\nMembrane filtration: This involves the\npassage of water that is pressurized\nthrough membranes.

The process of separation here involves removing ions from the liquid by\neither physical or chemical adsorption of the dissolved heavy metal ions.\nPhysical adsorption means that the ions get trapped in the adsorbent’s porous surface.\nHence, adsorbents with large pore size and high surface area among others are\nexpected to be good ones (Akhtar et al, 2024). In contrast, chemical adsorption refers\nto the use of the chemical compounds such as functional groups that serve as binding\nsites to which the ions exhibit high affinity.\nThe research on the use of waste materials in particular has been focused on the\navailability of these materials locally, thus, environmental sustainability due to the\nregeneration of the biochar (Carrasco et al, 2022). Therefore, water treatment with\nbio-sorbent waste materials.

The main mechanisms of zeolites are adsorption and\ncation-exchange, where the ions of metals in water are trapped and substituted by ions\n\nthat are on the zeolite surface. The combination of their porous crystalline structure,\nhigh specific surface area, and strong affinity for divalent metal ions makes zeolites\nhighly efficient in household-scale treatment applications.\n\n2.6 Use of natural zeolite in treatment.\nNatural zeolites have been the subjects of extensive research owing to their ability to\npurify water by removing heavy metals and other toxic ions, especially in the case of\ngroundwater contaminated with Pb2+ and Cu2+. The unique feature of zeolites which\ncontributes to their effective performance is their solid structure of aluminosilicate\nthat has connected micropores where metal ions can be readily adsorbed by cation\nexchange (Fernandes et al., 2022). Through the use of zeolites as a filtration or\nadsorption medium, water containing heavy metals can be treated to obtain a very low\nconcentration of these metals due to the large surface area of the zeolite and the very\nstrong affinity of the zeolite for divalent cations.\n\nZeolites are natural minerals formed from the volcanic eruptions, and their primary\nlocation is usually in the cracks and pores of the volcanic rocks. The development of\nzeolites is associated with the destruction of volcanic glazes, feldspars, and clay\nminerals under the specific conditions of hydrothermal areas (Fernandes et al., 2022).\nAlthough there are more than sixty types of natural zeolite identified across the globe,\nonly a few clinoptilolite, mordenite, chabazite, and heulandite are found in sufficient\namount and with the right quality to be applied for water treatment.", "word_count": 348, "start_char": 32031, "end_char": 34297}

But on the other hand, it is a significant advantage\nthat natural zeolites are much cheaper and easier to obtain than synthetic ones;\ntherefore, they can be used for rural water purification systems and household filtration\nsolutions (Fernandes et al., 2022). Their use in these situations has resulted in a growing\ninterest in their ability to remove toxic metals from drinking water in low-income areas,\ne.g. Kyabalogo Village.\n\n2.6.1 Adsorption\nZeolites have a very large specific surface area and a very large cation-exchange\ncapacity, which allow them to effectively adsorb metal ions that are dissolved in water.\nTheir open framework of three-dimensional pores allows for the presence of a large\nnumber of active sites where metal ions with positive charges like Cu2+ and Pb2+ can be\ncaptured and held by means of surface adsorption and ion-exchange processes. Thus,\nzeolites are appropriate for the removal of heavy metals from groundwater in treatment\napplications.\n2.6.2 Ion Exchange\nZeolites are crystalline aluminosilicates with negatively charged lattice sites that can\nexchange their native cations (such as Na+, K+, Ca2+) with dissolved metal ions in water.\nThrough this ion-exchange mechanism, zeolites can selectively remove heavy metals", "word_count": 272, "start_char": 34053, "end_char": 35841}

Such a catalytic character, in heavy-metal\nremoval, can give a boost to the adsorption process by assisting in the reactions that\ntake place at the surface between the zeolite and the dissolved metal ions. Therefore,\nthe binding strength of the metals like Pb2+ and Cu2+ onto the zeolite surface may be\nstrengthened which would lead to an increase in the removal efficiency.\n2.7.1 pH Adjustment\nAt the time of treatment, zeolites have the ability to alter as well as stabilize the pH\nlevel of the water that has been contaminated. A suitable pH level must be maintained\nbecause the adsorption efficiency of heavy metals, like Pb2+ and Cu2+, is highly pHdependent. During the adsorption process, zeolites can function as a mild buffering\nmedium, which would generally assist in controlling sudden alterations of pH in the\ntreated water and thus, increase the metal uptake efficiency.\n2.8 Modification of natural zeolites for use.\nNatural zeolite modification, a necessary process, comes first in the list of the steps to\nbe taken for improving its power as an adsorbent for heavy metals, like Pb2+ and Cu2+,\nin groundwater.

HCl,\nfor example, acid treatment, can effectively lead to the exposure of more active sites\nand hence, a better binding of Pb2+ and Cu2+ ions from water.\nFurthermore, besides mineral acid treatments, the polarity and surface charge of\nzeolites have also been changed by using organic surfactants for surface modification.\nSurfactants, such as quaternary ammonium compounds, form a monolayer on the\nexternal surface of zeolite and this, in turn, results in better metal adsorption and\ninteraction with the dissolved contaminants (Fernandes et al., 2022).\nThermal activation, salt impregnation, and particle-size reduction are some of the\nother enhancement techniques that may come under the umbrella of household-scale\nfiltration applications, whereby adsorption kinetics would be improved and,\nconsequently, removal efficiency increased.\n\nCHAPTER THREE: METHODOLOGY\n3.0 Introduction\nThis chapter explains the methods and materials used to achieve the objectives of the\nresearch.

The unprotected\nsprings are surrounded by humans and their activities—such as washing clothes, bathing,\nvehicles washing, watering animals, and disposing of household refuse—which definitely\nraise the contamination risk. Along with this, the nearby agricultural fields contribute\nto the problem through runoff, fertilizers, and leaching from soils giving rise to heavy\nmetals and other pollutants in the groundwater.\n\nThe sampling points were strategically chosen to reflect the differences in exposure:\n• Spring A (Protected) – Approx. 0°25′05′′N, 32°45′10′′E, situated upstream in\na sheltered area.\n• Spring B (Unprotected) – Approx. 0°24′58′′N, 32°45′20′′E, midpoint close to\ndomestic activities.\n• Spring C (Unprotected) – Approx. 0°24′52′′N, 32°45′35′′E, downstream, near\nareas for agricultural and waste disposal.\n\nThe groundwater quality in the village is represented by these springs and also the\neffectiveness of zeolite-based treatment for heavy-metal removal under household\nconditions is made possible to be assessed through these springs.\n\n3.1.2 Sampling procedure\nDuring a month-long period, water samples from three springs in Kyabalogo Village,\nNakisunga Sub-County were collected on three different days: 8th, 15th, and 21st\nSeptember.

This\ntechnique allowed for accurate measurement of the heavy metals in the groundwater\nand at the same time made possible the assessment of the zeolite adsorbent’s\neffectiveness for the removal of these pollutants.\nDetermining the removal efficiency of natural zeolites in water treatment\nThe study used natural zeolite rocks from Mbale in Eastern Uganda. After mining, the\nzeolites were cleaned first and then crushed and sieved into different particle sizes\nbefore use in adsorption experiment.\n\n3.3 Objective II: Determination of removal efficiency of Zeolites.\n3.3.1 Material Preparation\nThe natural zeolite rocks sourced from Mbale in Eastern Uganda were initially subjected\nto a rigorous washing process with distilled water to eliminate any dirt, dust, and other\nimpurities. The zeolite materials were then subjected to a drying process in the oven\nat 105°C for 24 hours to evaporate any water present. After the drying process, the\nzeolite rocks were pulverized and screened to acquire a consistent particle size of 0.6–\n2 mm, which allowed for uniformity in flow and perfect interaction during the\nadsorption testing of heavy-metal removal from spring water.\n3.3.2 Preparation and Modification of Zeolite\nThe first natural zeolite rocks were hammered to break them into smaller pieces, after\nwhich a manual aggregate crushing machine was used to make them even smaller. The\ncrushed zeolite was later screened to get particle sizes ranging from 0.15 to 0.3 mm.\nMoreover, in order to eliminate impurities, the washed zeolite was packed in ovendried polythene bags at 70°C for 12 hours and then stored in polythene bags to avoid\ncontamination by dust.\nTo gain higher heavy-metal adsorption, chemical alteration of the zeolite took place.\nAn 800 g amount of prepared zeolite was combined with a 1000 cm3 solution of\nanhydrous ferric chloride (FeCl3) in water at the concentration of 21.36 g/dm3 under\nthe temperature of 25°C.

Various human activities\nsuch as washing clothes, bathing, jerry-can washing, and motorbike washing, among other domestic\nactivities, occur directly near the spring site and contribute greywater characterized by the presence\nof dissolved ions such as phosphates and chlorides present in washing soap and detergent to the spring.\nVarious studies carried out earlier have demonstrated that the presence of such chemical compounds\nSPRING A\nSPRING B\nSPRING C\nPH\nSPRING SAMPLES\n\nin domestic wastewater is responsible for the rise in the electrical conductivity levels in the\nspring and ground water sources, as more charged particles are added to the water column (QMUL,\nn.d.).\nOverall, in spite of the slight change in the EC values in Spring B, the levels in the other two springs\nare well below the national standards. This implies that the springs are less affected by the\ncontamination due to salinity and that the slight changes are due to the input of grey water in the\narea.\n\nFigure 6: Average values of EC for the three sampling springs points A, B and C\n4.1.1 Total Dissolved Solids (TDS)\nTotal Dissolves Solids (TDS) are those total solids in water that pass through a filter with a\npore size of 2.0 μm (APHA, 1999).\nTDS gives an approximate value of the quality of the groundwater because the total dissolve\nsolids affect the turbidity, taste, and conductivity of the water (APHA, 1999).\nFor naturally occurring groundwaters, TDS values are mostly due to the dissolution of ions such\nas Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, HCO3−, Cl−, and trace levels of ions such as Cu2+ and Pb2+.", "word_count": 429, "start_char": 53665, "end_char": 56133}

The results in the\nanalysis illustrate that the levels of Copper ranged from 1.10 to 1.30 mg/L while the average\nvalue is approximately 1.2 mg/L, and Lead was ranging from 0.20 to 0.24 mg/L with an average\nof 0.20 mg/L. The concentrations of both Cu and Pb in Spring B and C exceeded the\nrecommended levels for safe drinking water. The substantially high concentrations of the two\nmetals in Spring B could be linked to the uncontrolled human activities taking place in and\naround the source such as bathing, washing clothes, washing cars/bodas, and drainage from\nthe settlements that form the spring surroundings, thus resulting in the scattering of the\nmetal-containing sediments and dust into the springs.\n\nThe Spring C recorded a moderate to high level of metal content characterized by the presence\nof Copper at a level of 0.99 to 1.34 mg/L (approx. 1.2 mg/L) and Lead at a concentration of\n0.19 to 0.22 mg/L (approx. 0.20 mg/L).

The slight drop in the values\nrecorded on the final day might be attributed to dilution and incorrect calibration.

The\nexchangeable alkaline earth elements in zeolites include calcium, magnesium, sodium, and\npotassium, which migrate to the water in the process of ion exchange. The replacement of the\nhydrogen ions in the water with the weakly alkaline ions resulted in an increase in pH values,\nan effect that was accelerated by the size of the zeolite bed in contact with the water.\nThe first treatment phase was represented by the sample taken on 8th September, with a pH\nvalue of 6.58 ± 0.10. Upon treatment with a 10 cm layer of natural zeolite on 10th October, the\npH rose to 6.98 ± 0.12. This is typical for natural zeolite media, whose relatively low number of\nactive binding sites and relatively low surface activity make them less effective than modified\nzeolites. Also, the short contact time of two minutes in this treatment was a factor in the\nmoderate ion exchange and slight neutralization of the slightly acidic raw water sample.\nHigher pH increase was recorded in the second stage, where the sample collected on the 15th\nSeptember (raw pH value of 6.62 ± 0.12) received treatment on the 16th October with a bed of\nmodified zeolite measuring 20 cm in height. The pH of the treated water increased to 7.32 ±\n0.15, showing a higher buffering capacity. Surface modification is known to improve the ion\nexchange capacity of zeolite by accentuating the surface functional groups, pore volume, and\nthe availability of active adsorption sites. The deeper bed and the larger contact time of five\nminutes gave a higher chance of hydrogen ion exchange with the alkaline cations, resulting in\nhigher pH levels than in the natural zeolite sample processed in a shallow bed.\nThe last treatment process, applied to the sample of the 21st September (raw pH of 6.65 ±\n0.11), performed on the 23rd of October, consisted of a modified zeolite with a bed height of", "word_count": 416, "start_char": 59623, "end_char": 62069}

It produced the highest pH\nvalue in the treated solution, averaging 7.52 ± 0.18 at a depth where the higher quantity of\nzeolite present, along with its larger surface area and longer interaction time with the water,\nenabled the maximum utilization of the ion-exchange capacity of the modified zeolite. The pH\nof the resultant effluent shows a considerable neutralization process, resulting in an optimally\nwell-buffered pH suitable for drinking quality.\n\nFigure 10 : Mean pH values for samples of A, B and C at different depths n = 3.\n\n4.2.2 Electro Conductivity\nThe Electrical Conductivity (EC) of the raw groundwater samples taken from the springs on the\n8th, 15th, and 21st of September ranged from 54 to 57 μS/cm, with Spring B recording higher\namounts because of the grey water discharge from bathing, washing, and motorbike washing\npractices. The EC value of the water reduced systematically following the treatment process\n\ninvolving natural and modified zeolite beds of various depths, representing the process where\nthe ions in solution are removed through adsorption and ion exchange processes. The modified\nzeolite has a high cation exchange capacity, making it capable of removing ions such as Na+,\nCa2+, Mg2+, and trace amounts of heavy metals responsible for the conductivity in the water.\nFor the 8th September samples, following treatment on the 10th of October with a 10 cm bed\nof natural zeolite and a contact period of approximately two minutes, EC reduced slightly from\nthe raw levels (54.9-57.3 μS/cm) to an average treatment value of 50-52 μS/cm.
