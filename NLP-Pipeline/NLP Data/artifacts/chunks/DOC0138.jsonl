The existence of widespread misinformation, disinformation,\nfake news, and propaganda has led to limitations on digital journalism through internet\nrestrictions and policies (Florence, 2021). However, these policies were first introduced by\nthe colonial masters (Britain) in 1954, when the media industry was introduced in Uganda.\nThe Uganda Broadcasting Cooperation (UBC), which was a state-owned BBC, undertook an\nauthoritarian theory of mass media that censored freedom of journalism practices, limiting it\nto the promotion of British propaganda at the expense of ordinary Ugandans who demanded a\nlibertarian theory that anticipates equality and freedom in journalism practices. In addition,\nthe British used it to suppress the activities of Pan-Africanists such as I.K Musaazi, who were\noutspoken about the British state of governance by demanding policy reviews and political\ninclusion (Bob, 2012). With the evolution of the internet or the digital era, accessibility, and\ndissemination of information have increased, giving birth to digital journalism practices\namong student journalists, professionals, and citizen journalists within Uganda Christian\nUniversity, Mukono. This involves sharing media content through the internet as opposed to\nprint or broadcast. However, online sharing of content has been associated with falsification,\ndistortion, disinformation, misinformation, and propaganda, attracting numerous policies in a\nbid to curb, discourage, and limit their distribution. These policies include the Computer\nMisuse (Amendment Act), which has in turn crippled digital journalism practices in regard to\nunlawful exposure and sharing of information or data from fraud, embezzlement of funds,\ncorruption, misuse of public offices, human rights violations, and other activities that render\nany journalism practice a public watchdog and accountable to the society (Carl-Magnus\nHöglund & Johan Karlsson Schaffer, 2021).\nIn this study, I intend to examine the limitations that the amended Computer Misuse Act of\n2022 presents to digital journalism practices, the loopholes that may exist within the\nprovisions of the policy, and the framework within which media practitioners or journalists\ncan still operate despite the sabotaging implications of the policy.", "word_count": 396, "start_char": 13029, "end_char": 15811}

Journalists in Kampala and other neighboring districts have faced\nvarious penalties as a result of this law, including house and office searches, seizure of\ncomputer-related properties, threats, and arrests. For instance, Pidson Kakaire, the managing\neditor of Drone Media, was charged with criminal libel and offensive communication under\nthis law. Dr. Stella Nyanzi, a human rights activist, was also arrested and charged with cyber\nharassment and offensive communication (Michael, Anke F. and Kerem, 2016). The\nComputer Misuse (Amendment Act) prohibits the unauthorized sharing of information or\ndata electronically, the sending and sharing of malicious or unsolicited information, and the\nmisuse of social media activities. These provisions pose a significant threat to digital\njournalism, including public watchdog function, accountability function, and dissemination of\ninformation. It makes it illegal to access information or data without authorization, which can\nlead to penalties. The study also navigates how these loopholes influence journalism\npractices.\nAccording to Mr. Asuman Odaka, the Secretary-General of the National Economic\nEmpowerment Dialogue Party (NEEDP), the Computer Misuse Act of 2022 puts the practice\nof journalism on the brink of collapse in Uganda. Therefore, this study aims to identify the\nloopholes within the framework of this law that can end up crippling the progress of Digital\njournalism and that can be exploited by different parties with narrow interest. The study will\nhelp establish the limitations brought about by the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act) and\nits impact on digital journalism practices in Uganda.\n1.2 General Purpose\nThe main objective of this study is to analyze the limitations imposed by the amended\nComputer Misuse Act of 2022 on Digital journalism in Uganda Christian University. The\nstudy aims to identify any potential loopholes within the law that could allow digital\njournalism practices to continue legally and to evaluate the existence of a framework for\njournalists to operate within the law.

This is aimed at examining their\nexperiences while distributing online content within the provisions of the Computer Misuse\n(Amendment Act) and the limitations faced in the process. The study also aims to examine\nlegal experts on allegations that the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act) possesses Acts that\nare unconstitutional (loopholes) with the sole purpose of discouraging online activism and\nscrutinization of government apparatus. In conclusion, the content scope of the study is\ndesired to establish a framework within which Digital journalists can disseminate news\ncontent online without contradicting the law in mention.\n1.5.3 Time Scope\nThe study intends to cover a time period of four (4) months, this is based on the analogy that\nnews-worthy events and happenings transpire on a daily basis, and with Digital journalism\npractices at hand, the speed at which content production and distribution is relatively high\ndue to the accessibility ease that online platforms such as Twitter(X), Facebook, Instagram,\nYouTube, and Websites provide to the respective audiences. Therefore, a period of four\nmonths offers ample time to examine the limitations faced in the process of content\nproduction and dissemination by Digital journalists. In addition, it should also be able to\nestablish a framework within which Digital journalists can still produce content and distribute\nwithout contradicting the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act) and finally to assess legal\nexperts on the unconstitutionality through loopholes that are within the provisions of the\nComputer Misuse (Amendment Act).\n1.6 Justification of the Study\nThis study is imperative on the following counts;\n• It will identify, assess, and define various limitations initiated on Digital journalism\npractices by the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act).

In addition,\nit will clearly show how these limitations on Digital journalism practices have led to\nwidespread unaccountability and reduced follow-up on issues of public interest for\nexample corruption scandals, abuse of public offices, and embezzlement of public\nfunds because of hindrances brought by provisions such as accessing unauthorized,\nmalicious and unsolicited information.\n• This study will establish a framework within which Digital journalists including\nprofessionals, students, and citizen journalists within Mukono can still practice within\nthe constraints of the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act). This is aimed at\nmaintaining the coherence of the practice due to the accessibility and favorable\nconditions offered by digital platforms such as Websites, Search engines, Facebook,\nTwitter(X), Instagram, and YouTube.\n• The research findings of this study will not only benefit Digital or online journalists\nby\noutlining\nthe\nlimitations,\nand\nexisting\nframework\nand\nestablishing\nunconstitutionality that requires reforms but also civic organizations and societies\nwho share influential content and ideologies online will get to continue with their\npractices through the aid of the research findings of this study.\n1.8 Theoretical Framework\nThe theoretical framework of this study is based on the approaches of the critical, libertarian,\nnormative, and authoritarian theories of media because they are largely associated with\nauthorities and press freedoms as seen below;", "word_count": 363, "start_char": 22468, "end_char": 25026}

In addition, it further indicates that the internet provides innovational\nstructures that collectively unify respective audiences.\nThe study conveys the approaches of the Libertarian theory of media with an interest in the\nevolution of media through digitalization, which states that people are rational beings who are\ncapable of distinguishing right and wrong, Kimumwe (2020) further states that man should be\naccorded equal rights and opportunities to express oneself. In regards to digital journalism\npractices, professionals, students, and citizen journalists should conceptualize, produce, and\ndistribute online content that is of public interest and impactful to society without limitations\nbrought by the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act).\nThis study further navigates that for new policies such as the Computer Misuse (Amendment\nAct) to prevail, the normative theory of media is put into consideration since it states an ideal\nframework through which media systems are operated by the state, authority, and\ngovernments. In addition, it stresses media relations with political administrations rather than\nmedia and public interests such as scrutiny and accountability.\nThis study also hints at the authoritarian theory of media which states that man is weak\ninsinuating that he is overshadowed by the powers and authority of the state and\ngovernments. In addition, it highlights that the media is meant to serve the functionalities and\ninterests of the state which includes propaganda manifestations and brutalization of\ndemocratic processes and participation such as elections in a bid to favor them (Anne, 2019)\nIn the next chapter, Literature Review, the study aims to define Digital journalism, Digital\njournalists, and Computer Misuse (Amendment Act), and how they have affected each other\nin the same sphere.", "word_count": 302, "start_char": 25026, "end_char": 27057}

It also strives to further\ninvestigate how researchers and scholars have assessed the limitations brought about by the\nComputer Misuse (Amendment Act) on the practice of Digital journalism, its impact on the\npractice after limitations, and existing unconstitutionalities or loopholes within the law.\n2.1 Understanding Digital Journalism\nThis section explores the definition of Digital journalism using different approaches as seen\nbelow;\nDigital journalism is the production and distribution of news resources on digital spaces such\nas Websites and Social Media platforms such as Twitter(X), Facebook, Instagram, and\nYouTube among others (Deuze & Witschege, 2018). In addition, Digital journalism is a\nnetworking that incorporates the production and dissemination of news and informational\nresources (Silvio, 2019) Many scholars have hardly desegregated both digital and traditional\njournalism in the aspect of consistency and news sourcing, but the tools employed in the\nprocess of collecting information distinguishes them (Ferucci, 2017)\nHermida (2010) defines journalism in the digital era as moving journalism or journalism in\nmotion. The process of filtering relevant issues is the new phenomenon governing journalism\npractices in the online or digital space (Franklin, 2013, p. 1). Under digitization, journalists\nare availed with more chances which presents new bounds in the line of Analytics, audience,\nand algorithms. Under digitization, the most notable changes are between content consumers\nand producers, the agenda setting in media has changed since it has incorporated the public or\naudiences as well. In the online or digital era, the consumers of news resources have turned\ninto news producers due to easy accessibility to online platforms such as Websites and social\nmedia platforms. Therefore, this gives rise to digital journalists who may not necessarily be\nprofessionals in the field. (Loosen, 2014)", "word_count": 319, "start_char": 27057, "end_char": 29256}

(Loosen, 2014)\n\nIt should be noted that Digital journalism practices have become instrumental in the field of\npolicymaking, this is due to new challenges and concerns brought by the new technologies\npertaining to privacy and information security especially the unsolicited, unauthorized, and\nmalicious messages that are aimed at blackmailing, spreading propaganda and issues of\npublic interest. Apparently, these concerns about digitization have paved the way for policies\nlike the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act) with provisions such as abuse of social media,\nand unsolicited and unauthorized information among others with heavy fines and prison\nsentences accorded in violation.\nThe following explanations establish the 5Ws and H of Digital journalism as seen below;\n• Who\nDigital journalism does not limit its definition to certified professionals in the field,\nbut with the technological advancements, whoever has access to the internet and can\nsupply news resources and commentaries into the online or digital domain qualifies to\nbe a digital journalist. (Lewis & Westlund, 2015)\nJournalistic identity has undergone recession, this digitization has given birth to new\njournalism dynamics including citizen journalism hence infiltrating the environment\nonce dominated by professional journalists (Knight, Geuze, and Gerlis 2008; Singer\n2003)\n• What\nThe content arrays of digital journalism include articles, blogs on a website, YouTube\nvideos, audio, news headlines, editorials, and art reviews. In addition, has also led to\nthe evolution of new content such as podcasts, reviews, fake news, rumors, and\nmisinformation among others.\n• Where they operate,\nDigital journalism is not affected or limited geographically. This is because content\ncan be uploaded and disseminated through websites, social media platforms, and\nsearch engines with high speed and accessibility courtesy of connections through Wi-\nFi or internet data.\n• When\nDigital journalism knows no time, this is attributed to its speed where content is\ndistributed, redistributed, posted, and re-posted within a short time via wireless\nchannels and networks. These wireless channels and networks are due to the", "word_count": 366, "start_char": 28952, "end_char": 31418}

In addition, it lacks specific ways in which content should be availed\nto the public.\n2.2 Understanding the Computer Misuse (Amendment) Act\nThis section defines the provisions of the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act) regarding\nDigital journalism practices;\nThe Computer Misuse (Amendment Act) was signed into law by the President of Uganda\nH.E Yoweri Museveni in 2022. This policy was moved on the floor of parliament by\nKampala Central Member of Parliament Hon. Muhammad Nsereko to reform the Computer\nMisuse Act 2011 which was considered outdated. This move was backed by the idea that\ntechnological advancements had introduced new issues, threats, and concerns that needed\nurgent addressing.\nGoitom (2023) further asserts that the government of Uganda signed the Computer Misuse\n(Amendment Act) into law on the basis that transformations had taken place in the\ntechnological sphere without clear reforms or changes in the policies and laws governing\nthem. In addition, the digitization era introduced new types of content for example fake news,\nmisinformation which posed a threat to privacy and information security thus prompting the\ngovernment to sign into law the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act) which introduces new\nprovisions criminalizing some practices within Digital journalism including Abuse of social\nmedia, Unauthorized Access, Unsolicited Information and Malicious Information among\nothers.", "word_count": 307, "start_char": 31368, "end_char": 33495}

In addition, it places heavy\npenalties of fines of up to 15 million shillings or a prison sentence below ten (10)\nyears or both.\n• Unsolicited Information,\nThis provision states that Digital journalists should only disseminate information\nconcerning somebody else for example government officials only when they are in the\npublic interest, this is cited on the basis that unsolicited information may be without a\nperson’s consent and hence can lead to reputational damage.\nThis provision not only distorts the agenda-setting theory of media but also minimizes\nmedia relevance in the internet era where anybody with digital accessibility can easily\nset the topic of discussion.\nUpon violation of this policy and conviction, one can serve up to seven (7) years of\nincarceration and a fine of fifteen (15) million shillings or both.\n• Social Media Abuse,\nThis provision criminalizes the distribution of informational content in contradictions\nwith the domestic laws of Uganda under concealed identity or disguising with\ninformational resources belonging to others.

In\naddition, they also use sophisticated computer programs to monitor media activities online.\nUpon examining online restrictions through laws like the Computer Misuse Amendment Act\n(2022), different scholars, authors, and schools of thought agree that these policies undermine\ninternational human rights standards; they further state that these policies lack a framework\nof validity, legitimateness, rightness, and necessity. Through observation, researchers have\nconclusively assessed that domestic cyber laws in Uganda are often unverified and executed\nwith minimal monitoring (Florence, 2021)\nThe initial target of the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act) was to primarily litigate and\nintimidate free online sharing of information by Digital Journalists from accessing and\ndisseminating unauthorized information of public interest for example corruption scandals,\nfraud, bribery, embezzlement of public funds and incompetence among government officials.\nIt has in turn been used to truncate the activities of these online journalists who offer forums\nthat scrutinize, reduce inadequacies, and hold the government accountable for all business\ndone in public offices from health structures, education systems, and public service delivery\namong others (Matsiko and Kersting, 2023). It should be noted that the media industry\nunderwent numerous transitional changes under the Museveni regime, especially regarding\nregulations and policies, this is evident through the Computer Misuse Act of 2011 (amended\n2022) among others. Dr. Emily Maractho alludes that for the administration and evolution of\nmedia in Uganda to be probed, the legal structures and policies have to be thoroughly\nconveyed (Maractho, 2015)\nIt should be noted that in countries like Uganda, exercising political rights is limited to\nelections which are often characterized by violence, abductions, rigging, and tribal\naffiliations. Therefore, online platforms or Computer-mediated communication tools avail\nnew measures in political participation which includes awareness from Digital journalists and\nactivists through tools such as Twitter(X), Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube to rally for\ninfrastructural, administrational, and policy improvements in the line of health, education and\nservice delivery (Matsiko and Kersting, 2023).

For Digital journalism practices to be free, the public\nor masses must determine what they expect from that particular media apparatus (public\nagenda setting) (Michael Meyen et al., 2016)\nDigital Journalists in Uganda consider themselves as mediators, or interposition themselves\nas part of the public hence making them cover stories on issues affecting or happening within\ntheir particular spheres of influence. However, some Digital journalists affiliate more with the\nstate functions than their role as the fourth estate or watchdog which asserts the Normative\ntheory of mass media (McIntyre & Meghan, 2021).

It relies\nentirely on navigating concepts, experiences, and opinions of digital journalists, scholars, and\nlegal experts to guide the ideological approach. It assesses the qualitative approach used in\nthis study. It further addresses the data collection methods including questionnaires,\ninterviews, and focus group discussions. This module also dispenses analytical processes and\ndata interpretation techniques including reliability and validity. In conclusion, this module\ndefines the ethical considerations and limitations of this study.\n3.1 The Research Design\nLelissa (2018) describes research design as the process of gathering, analyzing, and\ninterpreting research content or data. This intends to link the problem statement concerns\nwith the experiences, opinions, and concepts of digital journalism scholars and practitioners.\nThis states that the research design establishes the process of needed content or data, the\nmethodology applicable to find out the data, and how analysis will be done in a manner that\nresponds to the research questions which include: the limitations facing digital journalism\nunder the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act), the existing framework within which digital\njournalism can be practiced and the unconstitutionalities or loopholes existing within the\nComputer Misuse (Amendment Act) in regards to digital journalism practices.\nThis study uses descriptive and explanatory approaches that offer ground reality to the\nlimitations faced by digital journalism while practicing their craft under this law, what and\nwhy there could be unconstitutionalities within the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act) in\nregards to digital journalism practices and how digital journalism practices can prevail\nwithout contradicting with the provisions of the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act). These\napproaches seek to establish factors that lead to happenings for example reason and cause. In\naddition, they offer backup evidence of their existence since they compare constraints and\nrelationships between various aspects relating to the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act) and\ndigital journalism practices (Lelissa, 2018).", "word_count": 374, "start_char": 39866, "end_char": 42544}

Therefore, different scholarly concepts,\nopinions, and experiences of digital journalism practitioners have to be assessed using\nmethods such as interviews, questionnaires, and focus group discussions to establish the\nqualitative study design.\n3.2 The Case Study Design\nThe case study design focuses on the qualitative research approach which offers various\nmeans of internalizing happenings or events for example through reviewing concepts and\ninteracting with digital journalism practitioners to get opinions and experiences. Therefore,\nthe qualitative approach generalizes in unraveling how the Computer Misuse (Amendment\nAct) and digital journalism practices have influenced one another within the Mukono setting.\nThis further states that the qualitative approach of research puts much emphasis on\nestablishing how phenomena transpire in case they co-exist in the same sphere or whenever\none is meant to regulate the other for example the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act) as a\npolicy was set to regulate the activities of computer-mediated forms of communication which\nincludes digital journalism practices.\n3.2.0 Justification\nQualitative research approaches will investigate and produce in-depth accounts of the\nconcepts, perspectives, and experiences of the participants involved for example in this case\nthe digital journalism practitioners, media scholars, and legal experts within Uganda\nChristian University. (Creswell, & Plano Clark, 2011; Munhall, 2012; Wuest, 2012;\nHolloway & Galvin, 2016). Qualitative research will navigate how digital journalism\npractices can continue within the existing framework of the Computer Misuse (Amendment\nAct), it also establishes the loopholes within the provisions of the Computer Misuse\n(Amendment Act) and some of the limitations brought by the Computer Misuse (Amendment\nAct) on the practice of digital journalism, these are all through subjecting participants such as\ndigital journalism practitioners, media scholars and legal experts to the descriptive natures of\nthe research questions that can lead to responses that inform the existing situation(Curry et\nal., 2009; Yin, 2015). The qualitative approach enables the researcher to possess and have\nconsistency in straightforwardness and responsibility throughout the research process hence\nenabling the readers to identify critical analytical decisions made by the researcher.", "word_count": 400, "start_char": 42218, "end_char": 45060}

This is because the institution is home to the School of\nJournalism, media, and Communication which comprises Media scholars, digital journalism\npractitioners, and student journalists who have practiced before or still practicing the art.\nTherefore, sampling will enable the collection of rich information and data regarding the\nimpact of Digital Journalism on Computer Misuse (Amendment Act) from Uganda Christian\nUniversity as a sampling base (Paton, 1990; Marshall & Rossman, 2014).\n3.4 Research Techniques\nThis study will explore several techniques in a bid to gather data and information on the\nimpact of the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act) on digital journalism practices in Mukono.\nThese techniques include interviews and focus group discussions.\n3.4.1 Interviews\nUnder this study, different participants including Digital journalism practitioners, media\nscholars, and legal experts from Uganda Christian University, Mukono will be subjected to\ninterview-based evaluations which will include question-asking and answer-responses. This\nis intended to produce comprehensive information or data about the impact of the Computer\nMisuse (Amendment Act) on Digital journalism practices in Mukono. This information will\nbe extracted from the experiences, concepts, and perspectives of these contributors.

These group discussions will involve designated\ngroups of Digital journalism practitioners including student journalists at Uganda Christian\nUniversity with previous experiences in practicing Digital journalism before and after the\nComputer Misuse (Amendment Act). This is intended to investigate their concepts,\nexperiences, and perspectives about the impact of the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act) on\nDigital journalism practices (Morgan, 1996). In addition, the study further explores\nincorporating respondent moderator focus group form of discussion. This will involve a few\nselected Digital journalism practitioners participating in the discussion to take up roles such\nas provisional group coordinators (Kamberelis & Dimitriadis, 2005). This is intended to\nreverberate the rest of the participants to give or exhibit independent responses, this idea was\nput into consideration to enable the participants freedom to discuss their concepts,\nexperiences, and perspectives. In addition, the autonomy of answers shared in the discussion\nincreases the depth and variety of concepts, experiences, and perspectives without mere\nrepetitions. In conclusion, the focus group discussions of data collection give room for\nstraightforward and frank answers which are needed to cultivate the gaps identified by this\nstudy.\n3.5 Data Collection\nThis study will explore the use of interviews and focus group discussions in collecting data or\ninformation on the impacts of the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act) for example the\nresearch question: What are some of the limitations brought by the Computer Misuse\n(Amendment Act) on digital journalism practices will be addressed using both interviews and\nfocus group discussion to widen the resulting scope, the research question on how digital\njournalism practices can work within the framework of the Computer Misuse (Amendment\nAct) will be subjected to focus group discussions to verify what the majority think or regard\nas appropriate.

In addition, it adds\nvalidity to the result or outcome of the research process (Holloway, 2005; Creswell, 2007)\n3.6 Data Analysis\nUnder this stage, different analytical approaches will be explored to review and preview the\nexperiences, perspectives, and concepts of the participants. This is intended to determine the\noutcomes of the research study on the impact of Computer Misuse (Amendment Act) on\nDigital journalism practices in Mukono. These approaches include thematic analysis, content\nreview analysis, and Narrative analysis.\n• Thematic Approach\nThis approach incorporates identifying repeated views or perspectives in a collection\nof data or information. In this study, this approach will be used to address responses\nto research questions such as; What are some of the limitations brought by the\nComputer Misuse (Amendment Act) on Digital journalism practices in all the data\ncollection methods including interviews and focus group discussions. This is intended\nto enable the identification of any repeated views or ideas from the participants\n(Leonard & David, 2016).\n• Content Review\nUnder this approach, reviews will be done on previous texts and declarations that\nhave been produced in line with the impact of the Computer Misuse (Amendment\nAct) on the practice of Digital journalism through examining texts, key highlights,\nand various concepts of media scholars or Digital journalism practitioners to analyze\nthe existence, interpretations, and similarities of those texts, highlights and conceptual\nanalogies from the focus group discussions and interviews(A.J, Kheinheksel, et.al,).\n• Narrative Approaches\nThis explores Digital journalism practitioners as examples and concentrates on\nestablishing their narration of data and seeks to build knowledge based on the\nexperiences of Digital journalism practitioners while creating content before and after\nthe Computer Misuse (Amendment Act). This is through identifying coordinating\nsequences within the narrations of Digital journalism practitioners as they discuss\ntheir experiences before and after the signing of the Computer Misuse (Amendment\nAct). This approach also seeks to examine what digital journalism practitioners think\nabout the possible unconstitutionalities within the provisions of the law (Josselson, R.,", "word_count": 378, "start_char": 49681, "end_char": 52305}

This approach can contextualize and energize the\nperspectives of digital journalism practitioners affected by the Computer Misuse\n(Amendment Act).\n3.7 Quality Control\nThis study intends to undertake the reliability and validity procedure in maintaining the levels\nof information or data and the data collection methods such as interviews and focus group\ndiscussions. These quality control approaches will provide the readers with reliable and\nvalidated research outcomes which aims at furthering more research information in the field\nof Digital journalism and the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act).\n3.7.1 Reliability\nThis study will determine reliability by creating provisions for an in-depth description of the\nprocedures and mechanisms which will offer other researchers a basis to gather their data or\ninformation with the same criteria (Firmin, 2008). It will also allow new researchers to carry\non work, especially those with matching research questions (Saumure & Given, 2008)\n3.7.2 Validity\nThis segment of quality control will cultivate internal validity to determine the extent to\nwhich data collected from interviews or focus group discussions represents ground reality or\nground examples. It will further navigate the methods of research and the contributors in this\ncase who include Digital journalism practitioners about the expression and presumptions of\nthe researcher (McMillan & Schumacher, 2006). To attain validity, this study will carefully\ndefine the data in-depth, clearly indicating unfavorable and contentious issues using other\nresearchers to assess the outcomes articulately, fact-checking and analysis,\n3.8 Ethical Considerations\nThis study intends to minimize threats aimed at reducing the integral aspect of Digital\njournalism practitioners (Polit & Beck, 2010; Neuman, 2011, Munhall, 2012). This further\ninsinuates that the participants will include entirely Digital journalism practitioners who\ncomprise professional journalists, citizen journalists, and student journalists. They will\nfurther be subjected to the optimum ethical procedures regarding their independence, forceful\nparticipation, secrecy, and privacy (Neuman, 2011; Scott, 2013). In addition, clarity and\nresponsibility will be presented regarding the procedure and conduct of the research by\nclearly establishing how the participants' consent was assessed, illustrating how", "word_count": 386, "start_char": 51924, "end_char": 54700}

The readers shall be made aware of the inclusion process of the\nparticipants, who in this case are Digital journalism practitioners.\n3.9 Limitations to the Study\nThis study is limited to data collection methods that require the presence of the researcher\nincluding interviews and focus group discussions. Methods like questionnaires and surveys\nwhich are more cost-friendly may not be applicable due to honesty concerns and the desire\nfor the researchers to get involved face-to-face with the research participants who are Digital\njournalism practitioners to understand their reactions as they explain or narrate their ordeals\nwhile practicing Digital journalism under the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act).\nThis study also faces limitations on researched studies specifically on Digital journalism and\nComputer Misuse (Amendment Act) with questions such as; What are the limitations facing\nDigital journalism practices under the provisions of the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act),\nHow can Digital journalism practitioners practice within the parameters of the Computer\nMisuse (Amendment Act).", "word_count": 209, "start_char": 54337, "end_char": 55823}

What are the loopholes within the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act), 2022 that are\n2. How can these loopholes hinder the advancement of Digital journalism practices?\nThe following objectives guide these research questions;\n• To assess the extent to which digital journalism practices have been limited by\nthe Computer Misuse (Amendment Act) within Uganda Christian University,\nMukono.\n• To find out how digital journalists can practice within the parameters of the\nComputer Misuse (Amendment Act) at Uganda Christian University, Mukono.\n• To examine loopholes within the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act) regarding\ndigital journalism practices at Uganda Christian University, Mukono.\nData interpretation is a crucial stage in the research process, as it enables researchers to make\nsense of their findings, identify patterns, and draw meaningful conclusions (Bryman, 2016).\nThe purpose of data interpretation is to:\n1. Identify patterns and relationships:\n(i)\nPatterns\nThe goal of data interpretation is to uncover patterns and relationships in the data that can\nhelp answer the research question (Creswell, 2014, p. 245). Meanwhile, a trend is a consistent\nchange in the data over time or across categories (Creswell, 2014, p. 240). A correlation\nindicates a relationship between two or more variables (Bryman, 2016, p. 338). Clusters can\nbe described as groups of cases that share similar characteristics (Merriam, 2009, p. 213).\nOutliers are data points that deviate significantly from the pattern (Saunders et al., 2016, p.\n542).\n\n(ii)\nRelationships", "word_count": 311, "start_char": 55440, "end_char": 57548}

An associative relationship indicates a\nconnection between variables without implying causality (Creswell, 2014, p. 241).\nContextual relationships consider the broader context in which the data was collected, this is\nbecause it calls for depth in its approach rather than just basics (Bryman, 2016, p. 340).\nTemporal relationships examine how variables change over time and it also considers that\nchange is a constant factor that minimizes its permanence (Merriam, 2009, p. 214).\n(i)\nFinal Conclusions:\nThis is a conclusion that is definitive and based on comprehensive analysis or analysis\nthat deals in intricate details or thorough investigation (Saunders et al., 2016, p. 545\nData interpretation involves drawing conclusions from the data, based on the research\nquestion and objectives (Saunders et al., 2016, p. 543).\n2. Support Arguments:\nThis provides evidence to support arguments and claims made in the dissertation. In other\nwords, it is a basement for narratives or theories that have been established (Merriam, 2009,\np. 212). Supporting arguments can enhance data interpretation in the following ways;\n(i)\nContextualization:\nThis provides context to the data, making it more meaningful and relevant. This can also\nsuggest that it gives a broader picture of the data collected hence making it more valueoriented (Creswell, 2014, p. 245)\n(ii)\nValidation:\nThis provides a basis that strengthens the credibility of findings through logical reasoning and\nevidence. It is important to note that evidence is crucial in examining the credibility of a\ngiven narrative; therefore, validation assists in providing a background basis that enables the\ndata interpretation process to flow successfully\" (Bryman, 2016, p. 342).

Clarification also involves breaking down details\nthat may be hard to digest by the audiences. This move helps to make data more\nunderstandable and also eases the interpretation process. It is important to note that when\ndata is broken down, it simplifies the identification of gaps and missing links which helps\nto inform the theory further.\n(iv)\nGeneralizability:\nThis considers how findings can be applied to wider contexts or populations (Saunders et al.,\n2016, p. 545). It is based on the scope of the data collected, anticipating that the data should\nencompass a broader range to ensure that it is not limited to only a specific phenomenon.\n(v)\nTheoretical connections:\nThe process of connecting data insights with established theories or frameworks serves to\nenrich our understanding (Eisenhardt, 1989, p. 548). It's noteworthy that data trends\nfrequently mirror existing theories or narratives. For instance, the mass society theory,\nwhich suggests that individuals have a preference for belonging to larger societal groups,\nis often utilized to analyze various behavioral patterns, particularly in times of change.\n3. Inform-decision making\nThe process of informing decision-making through data interpretation is essential as it allows\nstakeholders to make well-informed decisions based on valuable insights derived from data\nanalysis. This approach not only guides decision-making but also plays a significant role in\nshaping theories and practices, as highlighted by Eisenhardt (1989, p. 548). Here’s how\ninforming decision-making helps in data interpretation;\n(i)\nIdentifying key findings:\nData interpretation is an essential process in research as it involves analyzing and making\nsense of data to uncover valuable insights.

These help the research findings to possess the\nmost relevant arguments which helps in providing a comprehensively concluded report\nthat informs the research study accordingly. Evaluating options helps to provide basis to\nselect the most vital tips within the data so as to inform the research study.\n4. Identify limitations:\nData interpretation should also consider the limitations of the study, including\npotential biases and errors (Creswell, 2014, p. 248). This argues that potential biases\nand errors may appear in the provisional findings therefore identifying those\nlimitations assists in filtering or verifying unwanted data traits within the findings.\nThe following are the different ways through which limitations are identified within\nthe data;\n(i)\nExposing assumptions:\nData interpretation reveals underlying assumptions made during data collection or\nanalysis (Bryman, 2016, p. 343). Bryman argues that while collecting data, it is\npossible for a researcher to make certain assumptions or assertions in a bid to gather\ndata according to their narrative. These assumptions may sometimes have elements of\npropaganda or bias whose identification is vital during the data interpretation process.\nIt is important to analyze data that is free from assumptions but genuine facts gathered\nfrom the field.\n(ii)\nHighlighting gaps:\nInterpreting data identifies gaps in data coverage, sampling, or instrumentation\n(Merriam, 2009, p. 217). When data is interpreted, gaps within the content gathered,\nand methods used can be identified, these gaps help to expose unwanted loopholes\nwithin the data structure which helps to minimize irregularities within the findings.

Deleting errors helps to reduce or do away with unwanted traits\nwithin the data. This also helps to provide clean data for coding or analysis, having\nclean data without errors is important in analysis and conclusion as it provides ground\nfor informative and relevant conclusions.\n(iv)\nUncovering inconsistencies:\nInterpreting data involves a detailed examination of patterns, trends, and relationships\nwithin the dataset (Eisenhardt, 1989, p. 549). This meticulous process enables the\nidentification of inconsistencies or irregularities before the commencement of data\nanalysis. Uncovering these discrepancies within the data structure allows for\ncorrective action to be taken, ensuring that the subsequent analysis is based on reliable\nand precise data, thereby minimizing the risk of drawing incorrect conclusions.\n(v)\nAssessing reliability and validity:\nWhen interpreting data, it's important to consider the broader context in which the\nstudy was conducted, as mentioned by Bryman in 2016 (p. 342). Using theoretical\nframeworks to guide the analysis, as suggested by Eisenhardt in 1989 (p. 545), can\nenhance data interpretation. Additionally, researchers should explore alternative\nexplanations for their findings during data interpretation, as emphasized by Merriam\nin 2009 (p. 215). It's also crucial to document the process of data interpretation to\nensure transparency and replication of the results.\n5. Contextualize findings:\nContextual findings play a crucial role in data interpretation by providing a deeper\nunderstanding of the research phenomenon. Contextualization involves considering\nthe social, cultural, historical, and environmental factors that influence the data\n(Creswell, 2014, p. 245). Interpreting data requires considering the broader context in\nwhich the study was conducted (Bryman, 2016, p. 342). Contextual findings help in\ndata interpretation through the following ways;\nIdentify patterns and relationships that may not be immediately apparent (Bryman,\n2016, p. 342).

It develops more effective interventions or solutions by\nunderstanding the contextual factors that influence the phenomenon (Bryman, 2016,\np. 343)\n6. Use theoretical frameworks:\nA theoretical framework plays a crucial role in data interpretation by providing a\nconceptual lens through which to examine and understand the data (Creswell, 2014, p.\n245). It enables researchers to:\nIdentify patterns and relationships in the data that align with or challenge existing\ntheories (Bryman, 2016, p. 342). It develops a deeper understanding of the research\nphenomenon by situating it within a broader theoretical context (Merriam, 2009, p.\n215). It enhances the validity and reliability of findings by ensuring that they are\ngrounded in established theoretical concepts (Saunders et al., 2016, p. 545). Increase\nthe generalizability of findings by demonstrating how they contribute to or challenge\nexisting theoretical knowledge (Eisenhardt, 1989, p. 548). Data interpretation can be\nenhanced by using theoretical frameworks to guide the analysis (Eisenhardt, 1989, p.\n545). It can develop a clear research question and objectives that are aligned with the\ntheoretical framework (Creswell, 2014, p. 246). It is used to select appropriate data\ncollection and analysis methods that are consistent with the theoretical framework\n(Bryman, 2016, p. 343). They are also used to identify potential biases and\nassumptions that may have influenced data collection or analysis (Merriam, 2009, p.\n217).\nConclusively, a theoretical framework is essential for data interpretation as it provides\na conceptual structure for understanding the data and situating it within a broader\ntheoretical context.

In addition, the initial target of the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act) was to\nprimarily litigate and intimidate free online sharing of information by Digital Journalists from\naccessing and disseminating unauthorized information of public interest for example\ncorruption scandals, fraud, bribery, embezzlement of public funds and incompetence among\ngovernment officials “How can these loopholes hinder the advancement of Digital Journalism\npractices?” the respondents presented similar results as follows;\nRespondent A\nThis respondent argued that selective enforcement of the provisions of the Computer Misuse\nAmendment Act (2022) might create an effect on freedom of expression among Journalists.\nThe respondent further explained that fear of violating the law or facing consequences could\nlead to self-censorship, causing journalists to refrain from covering certain topics or\nexpressing controversial opinions. Since the law restricts Digital Journalism practices, the\nrespondent asserted that narrow interest parties may exploit loopholes to hinder investigative\njournalism efforts since it limits access to information or intimidates journalists who seek to\nuncover wrongdoings.\nThis particular respondent asserts that the loopholes within the Computer Misuse\nAmendment Act (2022) have removed the digital freedom journalism had which affects the\npractice, since they have been restricted, journalists will start sugarcoating things instead of\ncoming out as the voice to the voiceless.", "word_count": 346, "start_char": 89092, "end_char": 91535}

In addition, respondent F “narrates that you can’t tell me\nthat you want to prohibit hate speech when they are to ask what hate speech is and how it is\nmeasured?”.

It is important to note the responses were 60% which narrowed the scope of the\nfindings. In addition, the questionnaire method of research was envisioned to allow the\nparticipants to express themselves freely while responding to the questions at their own pace\nbut it turned out that some participants forgot or lost interest in the cause hence this limited\nour scope of findings. It should also be noted that some participants did not provide detailed\nexplanations to the questions despite it being open-ended as qualitative research demands.\nThis therefore limited our analysis of their responses since we could not understand which\nschool of thought inspired their responses and hence could not make assumptions on their\nbehalf.\n5.5 Unexpected results\nThe following are some of the unexpected results registered from the research study\nconducted to assess the impact of the Computer Misuse Amendment Act (2022) on Digital\nJournalism practices: A Case study of Uganda Christian University. Three research questions\nwere formulated and sent inform of a questionnaire survey. The questions included;\n1) What are the loopholes within the Computer Misuse (Amendment Act) 2022 that are\n2) How can these loopholes hinder the advancement of digital journalism practices?\n3) How can these loopholes be bridged?\nThe following were some unexpected results from the research questions as seen below;", "word_count": 406, "start_char": 97442, "end_char": 99998}
