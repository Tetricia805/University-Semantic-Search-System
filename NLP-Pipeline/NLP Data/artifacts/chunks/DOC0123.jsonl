Asamoah-Gyadu explains\nhealing and deliverance from a charismatic point of view as 'the deployment of divine power\nand authority in the name or blood of Jesus perceived in pneumatological terms as the\nintervention of the Holy Spirit to provide release for demon-possessed, demon-oppressed,\nbroken, disturbed and troubled persons in order that victims may be restored to proper\nfunctioning order, that is, to health and wholeness and being thus freed from demonic\ninfluence and curses, they may enjoy God’s fullness of life understood to be available in\nChrist.\nFrom\nthis\nthe\nperspective,\nhealing\nand\ndeliverance,\nis\nconsidered\nto be an avenue as well as the practice which employs certain Christian religious activities\nwith\nthe\npurpose\nof\nresponding\nto\nthe\nhuman\nexistential\nneeds.\nAccording to Asamoah-Gyadu, \"healing and deliverance\" ministry has become popular in\nAfrican contexts such as Ghana because it takes the African worldviews of mystical causality\nseriously. This Christianity promises Christian alternatives to the search for security that\ndrives people into the courts of other religious functionaries.\nContrasting the African nature of churches with the western mission churches (Allan\nAnderson) argued that the churches are motivated by a desire to meet the physical, emotional\nand spiritual needs of Africans, offering solutions to life’s problems and finding ways to cope\nwith the threatening and anxieties of a hostile world. This rapid growth, according to\n(Anderson), is attributed to the churches’ focus on making meaning of the contemporary\nexistential problems that confront Christians through their contextualization approach.\n\nThis explanation indicates that the ministry of healing and deliverance focuses on enabling\nbelievers to experience spiritual freedom and physical healing and wholeness. The gift of\nhealing as addressed in 1 Corinthians 12:28 and in discover your Spiritual Gifts by Wagner\n\n(2012) implies that the use of the word healing is not restricted to physical disease. Rather, it\ncan also be used to refer to cure of mental, emotional and spiritual illnesses (2012, p.12).", "word_count": 387, "start_char": 12618, "end_char": 15176}

In fact he writes concerning this\nministry that; Christians should be aware that the gifts of the Spirit, such as exhortation,\nwisdom, knowledge, the discerning of spirits, tongues, the interpretation of tongues,\nintercession, and deliverance can complement and be used along with gifts of healing. For\nthose who are emotionally wounded but not demonized, gifts of healing, exhortation and\nintercession are crucial (2012, p. 16).\n\nWhile according what Wagner statement above, most emotional hurts do not result in\ndemonization, but if an emotional wounded person is demonized, that person can best be\nhelped by someone who has either the gift of exorcism, discerning of spirits, tongues,\ninterpretation of tongues, or intercession. As the church ministers to her followers, it is\nimportant to incorporate the ministry of healing and deliverance. According to what scholars\nwrite about apostolic church, healing and deliverance are central to the ministry of the\nChurch. In the Apostolic church the bishop was the focus for the mission of the Church,\nfollowing in the footsteps of Jesus, who commissioned his apostles to preach, to teach, and to\nheal writes Harris and Clarke (1964) in\nLiturgy and Worship: A Companion to a Prayer Book for Anglican Communion.\n\nIn order to carry out this ministry of healing and deliverance, Hejzalar (2010), in the two\nParadigms of Divine Healing, writes that the attitude of Christ towards those with diseases,\nmental, physical illness should critically and carefully appropriated in the church’s actual\nexercise of carrying out the ministry of healing in this contemporary times (2010, p. 41). The\nuse of the gift of healing and deliverance seems to be catching up in the Church of Uganda.\nConcerning the growth of this ministry in Anglican Church;\n\nIn the Province of Anglican Church of Uganda hundreds of traditional Anglican churches\nhave been set on fire by the Holy Spirit. For example, All Saints Church in Kabwohe has\nshrunk to a handful of people a few years ago. But today the 400-seat building cannot\ncontain the throngs of worshippers who show up for Sunday or mid-week services therefore", "word_count": 420, "start_char": 14882, "end_char": 17469}

Whereas in Church of Uganda today, not more than 70% of the\nAnglican bishops are open to charismatic renewal, the ministry has been ignored, misused\nand carried out without proper theological consideration. The few churches that carry out this\nministry have not involved proper biblical teachings, and hence the exercise of this gift has\nbrought confusion and manipulation. In order to address the above issues in this ministry, this\nstudy sought to assess the low involvement of church ministers in the healing and deliverance\nministry so as to find out the strategies to make it effective and theologically sound.\n1.4 Purpose\nTo assess the reasons for the low involvement of ministers in the Healing and Deliverance\nMinistry in Diocese of Lango\n1.4.1 Specific Objectives.\nTo assess the knowledge of healing and deliverance among ministers\nTo assess the belief in healing and deliverance ministry by the church ministers\nTo analyses the priority of the church towards healing and deliverance\n1.4.2 Research Questions\n1- What level of knowledge do the church ministers have on Healing and Deliverance?\n2- What belief do the church ministers have on healing and deliverance?\n3- What priority do the church ministers have on Healing and Deliverance ministry?\n1.5 Significance of the Study\nThis research seeks to assess solutions and way forward that will help churches in the\nDiocese of Lango that’s overseen by Rev Can Dr. Alfred Olwa to understand the value of the\nhealing and deliverance to the church.

This section covers books, journals, reports and websites\nthat contain the scholarly work other people have written concerning elderly ministry. It was\nalso to review the ways how the church can establish the involving ministry, the role of\ndeliverance and healing ministry of the church.\n2.1. How the Church can Order its Ministry to include Healing and Deliverance\nChristian Healing Ministries in Jacksonville, Florida is a charismatic organization that\npromotes and practices Christian healing. Although known for healing prayers, its worldview\nis more holistic and includes different kinds of prayers that address emotional, psychological,\nspiritual and bodily health.\nDeliverance prayer is of particular interest because it imagines a world of “spirit attachments”\nthat are introduced to the body through multiple origins including trauma, inappropriate\nlifestyle, genealogical history, and intentional or incidental occult involvement. However,\ndeliverance ministry is particularly difficult to give explanation to since its imagined world of\nspirits is dissimilar to naturalistic explanations of disease. The contention of this paper is that\ndeliverance prayer is performative in which the participants symbolically interact with each\nother in ritual situations consenting to an imagined reality. Findings are based on participant\nobservations and interviews and are placed in the context of symbolic interaction and\nperformance.\nThe Practice of Healing and Deliverance in the Church Ministry enables the church to offer a\nholistic process of spiritual, emotional and physical well- being and wholeness of the\nbelievers. Hunter (1990) in the Dictionary for Pastoral Care and Counseling wrote that\nhealing is the process of being restored to bodily wholeness, emotional well- being, mental\nfunctioning, and spiritual aliveness. His description shows how Christian modes of healing\nhave always distinguished themselves by achieving a spiritual advance in connection with the\nhealing process. Healing may also refer to the process of reconciling broken human\nrelationships and to the development of a just social and political order among races and\nnations (Candy, 2011, p.64). This definition seems to focus on the social dimension of\nhealing. However, it ignores that spiritual dimension of healing.", "word_count": 410, "start_char": 21592, "end_char": 24426}

For instance, 1 Corinthians 12:9 refers to\n“gifts” of healing in the plural, which may indicate that there are different gifts of healing.\nThe gifts of healing could mean a very wide range of skills or abilities. This could be from\nthe power to do miraculous or dramatic healing, like making the lame walk, or the use or\nunderstanding of medicine. It could even be the ability to empathize and show love to others\nto the point of healing an emotional wound of which they are done in Lango Diocese.\n2.2. The Role of the Church in enhancing the Healing and Deliverance Ministry.\nThe ministry of healing and deliverance can be strengthened through forming prayer groups.\nShoemaker (1964) says that united prayer never fails, to live to some kind of constructive\naction. It seems to sharpen and focus all of our faculties, and we are led to do things\nordinarily we should never think of doing. He adds that group prayer sets up a positive chain\nreaction which no one can foresee the end (1964, p 144). Whether people meet as a family or\nin prayer study groups or meet in person “for special intentions” where two agree to pray\ntogether for a particular concern, or meet at the altar rail; the result is always the same power\nis released, people are healed and changed, hope is reborn., and above all they do their small\nshare in fulfilling Jesus vision: “that they be one; as though father, art in me and I in thee; that\nthey may be one in us that the world may believe that thou have sent me” John 17:21”.\nPearson (1970) healing is God’s act of love to say that God is love and yet not see him at\nwork in people’s lives is a cruel contraction. The God we worship is not an absentee land\nlord, but a loving, caring father who ministers to his children at their points of need.\nSometimes the need is for healing. Therefore, healing and deliverance should be seen and\nconducted in God’s love not for money and self-exaltation. In Luke chapter 4, Jesus began\nteaching about the kingdom of God and healing the sick, healing was the major part of the\nministry of Jesus. His very name means salvation, a word suggesting more than forgiveness\nof sin unto eternal life. The word literally means wholeness (1970, p 13). Our Lord’s earthly\nministry was to minister this wholeness in every area of our lives. God invested Christ in us\nwhen he sent him to die for our sins. And he intends to keep up his investment. Put other\nway, God, who loves his enemies so much as to send Christ to die for us (Romans, 5:8-10).\nAccording to Pearson (1970), the African Independent Churches (AIC), which arose in the\n1920s and 1930s, accepted spirit possession and witchcraft possession as a real phenomenon\nthat needed to be dealt with by the power of prayer. The prophets cast out spirits by means of", "word_count": 569, "start_char": 24117, "end_char": 27333}

In the 1950s and 1960s, the Pentecostal missionaries found\na similar response as they ministered to people they considered to be possessed by the powers\nof witchcraft. Even today it’s true that spirit possession is a real phenomenon that exists in\nthe church in Lango Diocese, and if the church could embrace the idea of healing and\ndeliverance, demonic attacks and possession can be dealt with” (1970, p 13)\nOnyinah (2012) brings out testimonies of Ghanaians, in his book Pentecostal Exorcism, who,\nwere involved in the traditional religions and had been delivered from satanic powers and\nbegan to share their testimonies. They began preaching on the need to receive Christ. Their\ntestimonies have become useful materials for evangelism for some churches. Testimonies are\none of the ways to witness to others like the man who was born blind that Jesus gave sight to,\n“he said to Pharisees that I was blind but now I see”. This will encourage others who are\npossessed to come for deliverance instead of running to which” (2012, p 147).\n2.3. The Role of the Ordained Church Ministers in the Healing and Deliverance\nMinistry in the Church.\nShoemaker (1967), Heb 4:12 say the word of God is alive and powerful than a double-edged\nsword, a very powerful weapon against the forces of evil and darkness. A spiritual\nrenaissance among God-fearing people of the world is more to be feared by evil principalities\nand powers than nuclear weapons, Satan trembles when he sees the weakest saint upon his\nknees (1967, p 14). Opok (2012) there is need for practitioners of the ministry of healing and\ndeliverance to walk in the spirit. This ministry is affected by prosperity gospel which is a sign\nof “walking in the flesh”.He adds that St. Paul sees the greatest threat to the believer’s life as\nthe flesh. The major area that the devil can use to harass the believer is giving him ground to\nwalk according to the flesh. He realizes that by walking in the spirit, the believer is able to\novercome the flesh” (2012, p 279).\nDeliverance is a very common and important aspect of the healing ministry. It is often\ndifficult for people living in our society to recognize the real presence of Satan and evil\nspirits, yet it is a continuous theme running throughout the Gospels and the New Testament:\n\"For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities,\nagainst the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly\nrealms\" (Eph. 6: 12).\nGod has designed that all of us who embrace Jesus Christ be conformed to His image. “For\nwhom He foreknew, He also predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He", "word_count": 514, "start_char": 27060, "end_char": 30042}

Jesus is the firstborn among\nthe brethren. The rest of the brethren are to be in the image of Jesus Christ, like Him. We\nare called to walk as Christ walked. “He who says he abides in Him ought himself also to\nwalk just as He walked” (1 John 2:6). If Christ walked in the power of the Spirit and worked\nhealings, deliverances, and miracles, then we should seek to walk in these just as He did.\nIn the human body, He was not omnipotent. There were times He was tired and had to\nrest, eat, and so on. He was chained, whipped, and nailed to the Cross. In the human\nbody, He was not omnipresent. He travelled on foot, in a boat, and on a donkey. In the\nhuman body, He was not omniscient. He grew in wisdom (Luke 2:46,52). He was taught\nby the Father (John 8:28). He did not know the day of the Lord (Mark 13:32).\nWhile according to Pearson (1970), the ministry of healing and deliverance (MHD) is\nchallenged by poor biblical interpretation of scriptures. Since the early days of the church\nthere have been those who get from scripture a message far different from its plain simple\nmeaning. Whether this stems from blinders put on by the intellectual outlook of the day, from\na proud desire to be clever, from a refusal to believe something they themselves have not\nexperienced or from a desire to rewrite scripture to their own liking, the result is the same a\nportion of God’s word lost as people apply their reason” (1970, p. 35).\nThe ministry of healing and deliverance is affected by limited Christian literature on the\nsubject; there are many books on prayer but it is hard to find one that is practical enough for\nthe average layman to utilize in his daily human experience. Books on prayer arrange\nthemselves in various categories and classes. Some are scholarly terms which for the layman\nare dry and impractical. Some are so mystical in character that only certain types of minds\nand temperaments can possibly understand them. Some emphasize narrow theological\northodoxies. Some are so broad and visionary that they only promote wishful thinking, while\nothers of a more modern version are geared down to such a low level of ideology that the\ncross is left out completely and individual health and happiness seem to be the only goal.\nLawrence (1996), in “The practice of Christian healing” attributes the decline in the healing\nministry in the early centuries of the church and today in some segments of the church due to\nignorance, fear, laziness and sin of its members, not the desire or purpose of God. He\nemphasizes his point saying that when the church members submit to God’s will and submit\nto his promises, healings happen” (1970, p35).", "word_count": 514, "start_char": 29868, "end_char": 32751}

These include extracting confessions publicly from selfclaimed witches in order to arrest attention before exorcism, since naïve people may be\nresponsive to suggestive stories and may assume themselves to be possessed. Again, such\nconfessions may put a social stigma on self- claimed witches who may never be accepted in\nsociety again. Confession however can be done privately” (2012, p 278).\nSpiritual disciplines of fasting and prayer on clients and exorcist are quite risky practices, or\nthe problems may be natural or sometimes they may need immediate medical attention. Still\nagain, publicity either before or after exorcism, writing down client’s information and\nannouncing them publicly or recording the process of exorcism for sale should be\ndiscouraged, since they betray trust and may give the impression that exorcists are using their\nministries for money. For instance, I saw a pastor on television and who was advertising,\nwanted to know whether their jobs will prosper them and said they should come with an\nenvelope of 200,000/= as “seed” offering before being prayed for. However, prayers should\nbe conducted in the simplest ways possible, to show the trust in the power of Jesus, who\ncharged them in (Luke 10:18-19) behold I given you power and authority to trample over\npowers of darkness and serpents and scorpions and healing the sick.

His description shows how Christian modes of healing have always distinguished\nthemselves by achieving a spiritual advance in connection with the healing process.

In Luke chapter 4, Jesus began teaching about the kingdom\nof God and healing the sick, healing was the major part of the ministry of Jesus. His very\nname means salvation, a word suggesting more than forgiveness of sin unto eternal life. The\nword literally means wholeness (1970, p 13). Our Lord’s earthly ministry was to minister this\nwholeness in every area of our lives. God invested Christ in us when he sent him to die for\nour sins. And he intends to keep up his investment. Put other way, God, who loves his\nenemies so much as to send Christ to die for us (Romans, 5:8-10). According to Pearson\n(1970), the African Independent Churches (AIC), which arose in the 1920s and 1930s,\naccepted spirit possession and witchcraft possession as a real phenomenon that needed to be\ndealt with by the power of prayer.

In fact there are only twelve recorded in the four\nmillennia of Old Testament history, far less than Jesus sometimes did in a single day!\n5.2 Healing and Deliverance in the Old Testament\nHealing is part of the great plethora of divine activities recorded between Genesis and\nMalachi. Each of Israel’s historical eras is peppered with angelic visitations, divine\nrevelations, anthropomorphic appearances, acts of judgment, supernatural manifestations and\nmiraculous deliverances which are purposefully recorded as evidence of God’s interaction\nwith mankind, but especially his people, Israel. These miraculous occurrences provided Israel\nwith confidence in their leaders and in the Scriptures that recorded their stories. How else\nwould they have accepted Moses’ ministry and message without witnessing the signs that\naccompanied him? Moses rod that became a serpent, the plagues of Egypt, the death of the\nfirst-born, the pillar of cloud, the pillar of fire and a host of other spectacular manifestations\nunderscored the fact that God was actively involved with his people and that Moses was his\nmessenger.\nThe same could be said of the rest of the Old Testament with its interweaving of prophetic\nactivity and real-time events. God’s way has always been to endorse his men and their\nmessage by signs and wonders that men might believe.\nThere are two main periods when such activities abounded in Old Testament times. The first\nwas during the time of Moses and the second during the consecutive ministries of Elijah and\nElisha. Far more supernatural events were recorded in each of these two eras than in the rest\nof the Old Testament added together. Though God was always at work in the world and\namongst His people, there were special times when his activity was intensified and\nobservable phenomenon flourished. They may be described as ‘times of refreshing from the\nLord.’ (Acts 3:19)", "word_count": 373, "start_char": 55034, "end_char": 57365}

Numbers 12:1-15 God inflicted\nMiriam with leprosy and Moses interceded for her saying, ‘O God, please heal her!’ Though\nthere is no record of her healing it must be assumed that the Lord exchanged this act of\njudgment with the lesser penalty of seven days of disgrace outside the camp. There is no\nfurther mention of her having leprosy. 1 Samuel 1:9-20 Hannah received healing from\nbarrenness in response to her personal prayers and Eli, the priest’s declaration.1 Kings 13:4-6\nKing Jeroboam pointed his hand in judgment at an unnamed prophet and it ‘shriveled up.’\nThe prophet interceded for Jeroboam and his hand was restored to health. 1 Kings 17:17-24\nElijah raised a widow’s son from death. 2 Kings 4:8-17 Elisha granted a child to the formerly\nbarren Shunnamite woman.\nAlso, in 2 Kings 4:18-37 The Shunamite’s son dies and Elisha raised him from the dead. 2\nKings 5:1-14 Naaman, commander of the King of Aram’s army, was healed of leprosy after\nfollowing Elisha’s counsel. 2 Kings 13:21 A dead man was thrown into Elisha’s tomb and\ncontact with Elisha’s bones raised the man to life. Daniel 4:34, 36 Nebuchadnezzar ‘looked\nto heaven’ and was healed of insanity.\n5.3 Healing and Deliverance in the New Testament\nIn the New Testament, Jesus commissioned others to heal too. For instance, Matthew 10:1\n“And when He had called His twelve disciples to Him, He gave them power over unclean\nspirits, to cast them out, and to heal all kinds of sickness and all kinds of disease. The healing\nscriptures show that healing was not limited to coming from Jesus alone.\nThere are also some promises of the New Testament for Healing for example, James 5:14-15\nsays, “If any of you are sick, they should call for the elders of the church, and the elders\nshould pray over them, anointing them with oil in the name of the Lord. Prayer that comes\nfrom faith will heal the sick, for the Lord will restore them to health. And if they have sinned,\nthey will be forgiven.”", "word_count": 432, "start_char": 57128, "end_char": 59640}

We need to help people receive their healing\nand deliverance through the supernatural power of God. There may be times where although\nmedical remedies are available, we minister healing and deliverance through the supernatural\npower of God to demonstrate God’s love, power, and reality.\nHere are a few biblical reasons why we must minister supernatural healing and deliverance\ntoday:\nMiracles, healing, and deliverance reveal the reality and nature of God. Miracles reveal God’s\ngreatness. Miracles demonstrate God’s compassion. Miracles have a powerful effect on\npeople, especially on those who do not believe. The importance Jesus gave to miracles. The\nKingdom comes with power.

Therefore, this chapter addresses the summaries of findings, conclusions, and\nrecommendations in relation to the study objectives, and will state areas for further research\nas illustrated below;\n6.2 Summary of Findings\nThe research largely relied on both male and female respondents during the study. Majority\nof the respondents were male 60% compared to female respondents 40%. In terms of age\ncategory, it was found out that respondents between the above 55 years were the biggest\nnumber 34% followed by the ages 50-54 years 20%. In terms of education background, it was\nfound out those respondents who has certificate of education with 50% were the majority\ncompared to Diploma holder 35% and then respondents who are degree and other\nqualifications 5%. Majority of the respondents were Christians/Church who have served in\nchurch committee for more than 5 with 50%, while 3-4 years in service were 30% and lastly\nthose less than 3 years were minority with 20% of the respondents.\nRegarding the practice of healing and deliverance ministry in the Church, 60% of the\nrespondents strongly agreed that healing and deliverance existed and 40% disagreed with the\nidea. About those who carry out the Ministry of healing and deliverance as majority 51% of\nthe respondents revealed that, the intercessors, others were 23% parish priests and 17% youth\npastors. It was also reported on how the Ministry of healing and deliverance was carried out\nand 44.7%, of the respondents said through fellowships, 34% prayers and 14.9% deliverance\nservice. It was reported that the Ministry of healing and deliverance was carried out every\nend of the week with 27.6% some reported mid-week with 23.4% and twice a month 14.9%.\nAbout what happened to people after experiencing healing and deliverance 40.4% of the\nrespondents had led a transformed life, 27.7% improved spirituality and 14.9% lived a\nprayerful life of change.\nRegarding challenges facing Ministry of healing and deliverance in the Church, 29.7%, of\nrespondents said lack of Biblical knowledge about the word of God for healing and", "word_count": 413, "start_char": 60585, "end_char": 63199}

It was also reported about when the challenges\nbegun to manifest in the Church and 38.3%, of the respondents said failing to attend Bible\nstudies conducted 21.3%, deterioration in faith of God and His powers of healing, 19.2%\nabandonment of Church services. Most members of the Church who were highly affected\nincluded 36.2% coverts into Christianity 25.5% children and 17.1% elders in the Church.\nLastly, there was a question relating to what strategies put in place to minimize the challenges\nfacing the Ministry of healing and deliverance in the Church. 36% of the respondent believed\nthat, there is need to teach people to have passion for Ministry of healing and deliverance to\npreach the gospel, 28% encouraged carrying out Bible studies to equip believers with the\nword of God, and also encouraging believers to repent of their sins, through praying, fasting\nusing the Prayer Book to get proper guidance on praying and preaching.\n6.3 Conclusion\nIn this chapter, the study examined some major concepts relevant to this research. Among\nthem are ill health, healing, deliverance and church growth. From the discussions, it has\nbecome obvious that several challenges account for lack of healing and deliverance ministry\nin the Church. Both physical and spiritual aspects have been identified as two major\nchallenges of lack of Biblical knowledge about the word of God and divisionism including\nlack of theological training. The chapter also examined the concept of healing and some of\nthe approaches that are adopted by different religions in the society to achieve it. It has\nbecome clear from the discussions that one major requirement for holistic and total healing\nand deliverance to discover the challenges facing the ministry of healing and deliverance in\nthe Anglican Church so as to identify and apply the most appropriate healing methods using\nthe right strategies.\nChapter two expounded the practice of healing and deliverance in Church ministry,\nchallenges, and strategies to minimize such challenges for effective church growth and the\nvarious dimensions from which it can be understood. Chapter three focused on the\nmethodological approach utilizing a qualitative approach, drawing on narratives and stories\nand seeking to answer the how and why questions, in addition to the question.

Others suggested the need to carryout\nBiblical studies to equip believers with the word of God.\n6. 4 Recommendations\nThe study recommends the following to be put into consideration, equipping church ministers\nand healing programs in the Church;\nMinistry to the sick and troubled is an essential part of the Church’s ministry. This ministry\nis one of prayer and sacrament, word and care. Healing and deliverance ministry in the\nChurch should ‘hold up the weak, heal the sick, bind up the broken’ (Prayer Book\nConsecration Service). This in the ministry should symbolize in the blessing of oil for\nanointing the sick during Holy Week.\nMuch attention should be drawn in the forms of prayer and guidelines found in the Common\nWorship Pastoral Services, in the section called Wholeness and Healing. These, (together\nwith the form in Common Worship itself, called Thanksgiving for the Healing Ministry of the\nChurch), suggest that laity may be invited to share in prayer ministry and laying on of hands.\nThe Diocesan Group for the Ministry of Healing should provide support and advice relating\nto Christ’s reconciling ministry of healing and deliverance to believers. The Group\nrecommends and endorses the code of conduct found in A Time to Heal Handbook and the\nguidance from the House of Bishops in equipping and mentoring believers for deliverance\nministry.\nDeliverance Ministry should be seen as part of the wider healing and pastoral ministry of the\nchurch. To help discern what sort of ministry is needed, and to avoid the problems of\nmisdiagnosis and inappropriate ministry the advice of the Bishop’s Adviser for Healing and\nDeliverance Ministry should be sought.\n\nThe Diocesan Deliverance Team (DDT) should aim at providing timely information, advice\nand support to Clergy. For example, they work in partnership with clergy to offer healing and\ndeliverance ministry to people in need. This may include responding to clergy enquiries about\npersons suffering from spiritual oppression, poltergeists and apparitions, previous spiritually\nabusive ministries, involvement with the occult, or reports of paranormal activity.\nHealing, reconciliation and restoration are integral to the good news of Jesus Christ. For this\nreason prayer for individuals, should focus through laying on of hands or anointing with oil,\nhas a proper place within the public prayer of the Church. God’s gracious activity of healing", "word_count": 433, "start_char": 65634, "end_char": 68372}

It should not imply a simple link between sickness and\nsin; Jesus himself warned against the direct association of disability and sin (John 9.3).\nHowever, prayer for healing and strengthening should not involve the rejection of the skills\nand activity of medicine which are also part of God’s faithfulness to creation (Ecclesiastes\n38.9-12; Psalm 147.3).\nThere is an urgent need for spiritual empowerment training in all dioceses in Uganda. This\nwould help to transform the prayers of all Anglican priests. The prayer should be something\nlike this:\n\n“In the Name of Jesus Christ, with the authority given to me as a Christian, I bind all\nenemies of Christ from operating in life (Luke 10:18-19). So Christians should receive\nthe Holy Spirit in the Name of Jesus Christ and by the power of His cross and blood.\nCome, Lord Jesus, and surround us with the power of Your Holy Spirit. Give us your\ndirection, Lord, on how to proceed. Amen.”\n\nThere is need to raise up more ministers to bring the Gospel’s message of freedom to those\nsuffering from demonic attacks, and raising awareness of the need for this important ministry.\nPractically speaking, this means pastors recruiting and training deliverance teams in their\nparishes and bishops appointing resource people to help pastors in this ministry. Lastly,\ndeliverance ministry seeks to help those who are encountering unusual and/or troubling\nexperiences that might be considered paranormal; or who feel afraid, oppressed or possessed\nby evil and to bring hope and the deliverance to those in captives (Luke 4:18-19).\n6.5 Areas for further research\nFor further studies, the following areas for research are suggested;\n1) The concepts of healing and deliverance and church growth in the dioceses of Lango.\n2) The relationship between healing and deliverance and church growth in Anglican\nChurch.\n3) The significance of spiritual healing and deliverance in the church ministry in\nUganda.", "word_count": 403, "start_char": 68088, "end_char": 70555}
