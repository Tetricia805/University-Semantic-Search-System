The main purpose of this study is to probe the sexual\nviolence faced by female journalists in the media houses of Uganda.\n1.1 BACKGROUND STUDY\nIn 2015, the executive chief officer who owns one of the media organizations in Uganda decided to\nhold a meeting for majority of the employees in Kampala Uganda where the head office is found and\nthis was because he got information on the ongoing much on sexual violence in his own organization.\nSo, in this meeting the CEO put serious blame on some of the male supervisors of different\ndepartments that had actually gone ahead to sexually violate some if the female journalists. It was\nalso reported that these male supervisors demand sex in exchange for any newsroom favors or in the\nmedia house. The CEO also pointed out that this habit had seriously affected the productivity and\ntraumatized the female journalists.\n\nIn Uganda today, most of the female interns and females who have graduated once they join media\nhouses they are always subjected to sexual violence. A female intern is supposed to get proper\nguidance from the professionals she has found in the media house but unfortunately these\nprofessional people divert the purpose and end up taking advantage on the female intern by\ndemanding sexual favors and if she says no, she is going to be ignored and abandoned hence spreading\nfalse lies about her that she was the one trying to seduce the man. Eventually this female intern is\nisolated and loses self confidence in her duties hence a decline in her productivity which yields\nthoughts of giving up on her career. (Jackson,2012)\n\nSexual violence of female journalists is the dirty little secret of media houses. [Jackson 2012]. This\n\nhabit really exposes female journalists to certain shameful actions that do embarrass them sexually\nas they go about their duties with the other colleagues in the space of work.

[Liena 2011].\n\nNortheastern University [2013] in the United States describes sexual violence as the non-welcome\nsexual advances, requests for sexual favors, verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature. And in\nGreece the laws state that sexual violence is a form of unwanted verbal, non-verbal and physical\nconduct of any sexual nature happening with the purpose of violating a person’s dignity and in\naddition creating a hostile, degrading and humiliating space. [Fasting et al, 214].\n\nIn Uganda, the Employment Regulation [2012] states that sexual violence as a direct request to an\nemployee for sexual togetherness. Sexual contact and any other form of sexual activity that involves\nexpress promise of preferential, threat of detrimental treatment in employment and threat about\nthe present or future employment status. This kind of practice according to the regulation can mean\nthe use of language, it does not matter if it is spoken, of a sexual nature such as unnecessary verbal\nadvances, sexual comments, jokes of a sexual nature, offensive obscene and flirtation expressions\nthat are pointed directly to an individual. Sometimes it the use of visual content of a sexual nature\nfor example sexually displayed pictures, sexually written material and gestures.\n\nSexual violence of female journalists in the media houses can be taken as a gender study and this is\nso because in period of the World War II, media studies were put into four major areas, the\ncommunicator, message, medium and receiver. Now since this study deals with the sender or\ncommunicator it qualifies to be under the media studies. It is great to note that scholars in the past\ndecided to put more attention to studying the message, medium, receiver and effect giving less\nattention to the communicator yet an effect on any of the four in the communication chain may\nactually affect the final message.\n\n1.1.1 Media Background in Uganda\nThe history of the media in Uganda goes back to 1900, when the missionaries from Britain established\nthe first newspaper in this country. The need to promote politics and religion encouraged\nmissionaries to come up with the plan of the newspaper [Chibita, 2010]. The African Centre for Media\nExcellence (2010) observes that the first newspaper-Mengo Notes was started in 1900 by the Church\nMissionary Society and closely followed by Ebifa Mu Buganda eleven years later belonging to the\nRoman Catholic White Fathers.", "word_count": 420, "start_char": 11579, "end_char": 14189}

It was that political role which the newspapers played that inspired the masses to demand\nfor independence between 1940 and 1950 that culminated into the country's independence in 1962\n(Chibita, 2010). Since the inception of the first newspaper, different individuals, politicians and\nreligious groups have been establishing private newspapers (Kaija, 2013). However, a fully blown\ncommercial media industry in Uganda unfolded around 1992 when the National Resistance Movement\n(NRM) government that had come into power in 1986 after a five-year-bush war liberalised the\neconomy and the media industry. Kalyegira (2013) writes that Uganda like many other African\ncountries in the 1990s liberalised their economies at the end of the Cold War after it became clear\nthat the capitalist West had triumphed in its battle of wills against communism. The countries\nembraced free market liberalism as a model that was encouraged and spread around the world.\n\nIn 1992, Kaija; [2013] points out that the broadcasting industry in this country Uganda at that time\nhad one Television and Radio station, Uganda television [UTV] and Radio Uganda, that were run by\nthe government whereby the TV operated during certain hours of the day and made sure it was\n\nclosed at midnight until midday the next day. When the government liberalised the media sector,\nUTV and Radio Uganda were in 1995 converted into Uganda Broadcasting Service [Chibita 2010],\nplaying more or less the same roles of a government media piece like before. The privately first\nowned FM radio and TV stations in Uganda to touch the airwaves were Radio Sanyu and that was in\nDecember 1993 and Cable Sat TV in 1992[Kalyegira,2013].\n\nHowever, according to the Broadcasting and Communications Market and Industry three quarterly\nreport released by the Uganda Communications Commission [UCC] in the month of September 2017,\nthere are 258 operational radio stations,31 operational free to air service providers, two operational\ndigital terrestrial stations, five operational digital satellite stations and three cable televisions.", "word_count": 436, "start_char": 13812, "end_char": 16662}

According to the Global Gender Gap Report 2017, Uganda ranked 45 ahead of Tanzania\nand Kenya in the 68 and 78 positions, respectively among the 144 countries that were studied by the\nWorld Economic Forum for women emancipation standards. According to Kaija [2013], the general\nvisible gainful strides in women emancipation in Uganda have been as a result of good gender policies\nthat begin with the country’s laws. Article 33 of the constitution of Uganda actually considers women\nas being equal in status with men and therefore entitled to equal opportunities in politics, culture\nand economy to improve their welfare,Kaija [2013] notices that to achieve such a goal the\ngovernment of Uganda committed itself to affirmative action aimed at opening a new chapter for\nwomen who had for long been locked up in chains at the backyards of their homes as housewives\nbecause of historical, economic and cultural imbalances.\n\n1.2 PROBLEM STATEMENT\nSexual violence runs on as a challenge that female journalists are facing in Ugandan media houses\n\ntaking place in so many forms including unwanted physical contact and demands for sexual favors\nand because of this pressure they tolerate and participate in sexual harassments in order to advance\ntheir careers. In the news rooms it’s such a serious issue that only women are violated sexually but\nalso the male however the women are the biggest victims in this scandal and carry the biggest\npercentage.\nLydia Felly Akullu of daily monitor [2023] says that Sexual harassment cases are on the rise in the\nnewsroom even to female student interns because many women do not want to speak up to save\nthemselves from public mockery. Silence of the victims, parents who protect victims and the people\nin high positions of power are catalysts to this vice. Training teachers, youth, social workers, the\npolice, the justice system, health care providers, would go a long way in curbing the vice. Therefore\nthis study wants to further investigate the sexual violence faced by female journalists in the media\nhouses of Uganda.", "word_count": 417, "start_char": 16270, "end_char": 18916}

Below are the\nobjectives.\n\n• To find out the ways how female journalists are sexually violated in the media houses or the\nnewsrooms.\n• To investigate on the challenges or threats female journalists face while trying to seek for justice.\n• To find out why the managers sexually violate female journalist and the victim’s responses.\n\n1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS\n1. What are the different forms of sexual violations experienced by female journalist in Ugandan media\nhouses?\n\n2. What are the barriers or challenges female journalist face when attempting to report s e x u a l\nviolations against them?\n3. Are female journalists in Ugandan media houses forced into sexual violations or there’s consent?\n\n1.5 SCOPE OF THE STUDY\nThe study is based on two televisions in Uganda and two newspapers. The television stations are NTV\nUganda a subsidiary of nation media group and UBC TV [Uganda Broadcasting Cooperation]. The\nnewspapers are the Kasangati Times Community Newspaper a private owned news agency and\nBukudde newspaper under vision group. These media houses have been chosen for the study because\nthey are easily accessible and are located in the heart of Kampala the capital city of Uganda. They\nalso have the largest number of female journalists working there hence making it easy to conduct\nthe study\n\n1.6 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\nThis study is indeed significant because it’s the minority of the researchers who conduct on sexual\nviolations in Ugandan media houses. This study adds or builds up on the current awareness on sexual\nviolations in media houses or newsrooms. There’s a lot that is new being done in secret in the media\nhouses. This study is significant because it compares and examines the existing data on sexual\nviolations of female journalist in the newsroom. This study will also arise concern and stir serious\npanel discussions in different media houses and other public offices in Uganda hence triggering the\nsexual offenders to stop.\n\n1.7 THEORITICAL FRAME WORK\nThis study is in hand with media and gender which carries on the objection theory. According to\nCalogero [2012] this theory examines the high tendency to equate women and their bodies hence\nnegative outcomes for women’s body structure.

A study by APA (2007) also shows that sexual\nobjectification of women exists almost in every aspect of life in the United States from the media,\nwomen's interpersonal experiences to specific environments and sub cultures. The study that\nexamined depictions of girls in the media including in commercials, prime-time television programs,\nmovies, music lyrics and videos, magazines, advertising, sport media, video games, and internet sites\nshows that women more often than men are depicted in sexualizing and objectified manners. These\ninclude wearing revealing and provocative clothing, portrayed in ways that emphasize their body\nparts, sexual readiness and serving as decorative objects.\n\nAlthough Tiggerman [2004] criticizes this objection theory that it was actually developed as a\nframework to understand the female experiential consequences of residing in a culture that sexually\nobjectifies the female body. Ballgame [2008] also critics this theory so much for reducing women to\nor referred to as a thing. That if a man wants sexual activities with a woman just because her body is\nappealing it is then equal to reducing her to a mier thing and the man is doing something wrong and\nthat it is a misleading theory because it pushes men who want to have sex with things or objects.\n\nMoving on, this study also aims at getting to find out deeply the modes or ways of sexual violence of\nfemale journalists through some of the experiences of victims in the Ugandan newsrooms, hearing\nfrom the victims, station managers or bosses and challenges faced while seeking for justice. So, this\ntheory is being used to explain why sexual violations are too much in the media houses or newsrooms\nand why some victims choose to respond in certain ways. According to Mills and Barlow [2012] a\n\ntheory used enables or helps to fully explain the world by giving ways of thinking about it and possible\napproaches that might have new knowledge. So, this is why the researcher aims to achieve by using\nthe objection theory to get deep into sexual violations of female journalists in the media houses and\nnewsrooms.", "word_count": 422, "start_char": 21186, "end_char": 23804}

Lasswell's model of communication, as any other interference with the\nother areas of the model would. This is one of the reasons why the researcher conducted a study in\nthis area to expand research on the sender or communicator as the case has been for the other areas\nof the Harold D. Lasswell's communication model such as: the message-medium-receiver-effects.\nThe study is guided by three research questions and a theory appropriate in discussing why\nperpetuators and victims of sexual violence behave in certain ways. This chapter has, therefore, laid\nthe foundation for conducting research in the area of sexual violence of female journalists in the\nUgandan media houses. I have noted the significance of conducting this research including that it is\nan opportunity to widen knowledge in an area where little attention has been given in the past.\n\nCHAPTER TWO\nLITERATURE REVIEW\n\n2.0\nIntroduction\nThis chapter mainly reviews the literature or information written by other scholars both nationally\n\nand internationally so we are going to identify and analyze the relevant information and research\nfindings by other scholars about the sexual violations faced or encountered by female journalist in\nthe newsrooms or media houses in different states like Australia and Europe specifically Ukraine. It\naims to provide and add on the current knowledge and gaps in the field.\n2.1 Sexual violence in Europe [Ukraine]\nUkraine free-lance journalist Aizenberg [2023] covers a story of one of the female journalists working\nat a certain media house in Ukraine who threw herself into the job and appeared to be a rising star.\nOne evening, the editor-in-chief, who would occasionally drive her home after late shifts, hinted that\nher “career would go up” if they went to Italy together. Scared and disgusted she refused and\nimmediately slipped from the hope of Ukraine journalism to talentless mediocrity in a week. She\ndecided not to tell anyone and resigned later on. Women journalists in Ukraine say that they are all\ntoo familiar with unsolicited sexual attention, often accompanied by the promise of some kind of\nhelp in their career. The NGO women in the media and Ukrainian Women’s fund [2022] found that\n53% of the female professionals have been subjected to sexual violence at work. Another 33% said\nthey had witnessed colleagues being sexually violated but only 9% defined themselves as victims.", "word_count": 436, "start_char": 23637, "end_char": 26334}

There\nhave been some stories of sexual violence detailed in autobiographies by female journalists and the\noccasional article in the mainstream media about individual incidents, but it wasn’t until 1996 that\na union survey provided statistical evidence of an industry-wide problem. That Media, Entertainment\nand Arts Alliance survey found that more than half of the 368 female participants had experienced\nsexual violence at work. In 2012, I conducted the largest survey of female journalists in Australia\nfinding that there was an increased number of respondents who had experienced sexual harassment\nin their workplaces. [ N o r t h , 2 0 1 5 ] . Sexual violence flourishes in cultures that\n\nprivilege hegemonic masculinity, and the male-dominated microcosm of the Australian news media\nhas provided a fertile breeding ground for sexual violence to become an engrained part of the\noccupational culture of journalism since women began to enter the industry in ever greater numbers\nfrom the 1980s.\n\n2.3\nSexual violence in Africa\nIn Egypt sexual violence is common in that a very big number of Egyptian women and girls complained\nabout the practice and went ahead to share some of their personal experiences on social media that\nthey have been going through [ Afify,2017]. The campaign that was stirred up by a university graduate\non the streets of Egypt’s cities where over the years women have always faced sexual violence by\nmen or even a gang of men during public gatherings, protests or celebrations.", "word_count": 319, "start_char": 26069, "end_char": 28066}

In the year 2013 and the year 2014 IWMF global survey, a British\nrespondent shared and described some of sad experiences while covering the Arab Spring at the\nTahrir Square in Egypt. She narrated that she was cut on the waist in a taxi while the driver who had\nlocked the door shamelessly masturbated on her and tapped on her buttocks. The interviewees in\nthe survey cited government officials and some police officers among the beasts of sexual violence.\nIt is important to note that the issue of sexual violence in the Arab world increased attention due to\nthe media coverage of sexual assaults and violence on female journalists and citizen during the Arab\nspring uprising [Melki,2016]. Egypt located in the North Africa, is one of the Arab countries where\nsociety accepts disrespectful treatment for women as earlier noted.\n\nMoving on, in Yaoundé the capital city of Cameroon in West Africa a female journalist said that she\nreally faced a lot of challenges each time she went out for interviews as male disturbers were often\n\ninterested in her than her role as a journalist [leina,2011]. Perverse and hungry editors also\ndemanded relationships from female journalists before granting them favors and most times female\njournalists working late at night are raped while returning home. Therefore, it was not surprising\nthat a television proprietor in West Africa once emphasized to his staff that ladies of the station\nwere expected to look beautiful so as to attract audiences and nothing too intellectual is required\nof them [Leina,2011].\n\nIn Tanzania, sexual violence is actually cited by Henshall [2012] as one of the major barriers to enter\nmedia houses for different roles.

In a society like Uganda where children\ngrow up being taught to respect elders, it's easy for young females to be confused and misled by\ntheir elders or superior bosses to the extent of being seduced and persuaded into a sexual\nintercourse. There is also evidence suggesting that male Members of Parliament in Uganda sexually\nviolate their female counterparts especially new comers. In an interview with the New Vision\nnewspaper, former Usuk county MP, Proscovia Alengot, who was the youngest in the 9th Parliament,\ncomplained about male staff members who used to violate her sexually, noticing that she had found\nthe practice traumatizing and that she would run home immediately after the plenary in order to\navoid the sexual beasts (Natukunda, 2017, April 11). \"You know men; they want to take you out,\ncomment on your looks, all those things\" (pp.33). A recent incident in which a female MP from\nWestern Uganda dragged a 25-year-old student to the courts of law for sexually harassing her, further\nexplains the extent of the practice inside and outside office. This is why in her study, 'Point of order,\nMr. Speaker', African women mentioning that their space in Parliament, relating to sexual violence\nof female MPs in Parliament, Tamale (2000) observes that the practice has reached an alarming level\nalthough many female politicians have adopted a 'thicker skin' that they don't regard the repetitive\nsexual remarks directed at them as a problem and hence just brush it off. However, if sexual violence\ncan happen to female MPs in Uganda, who are economically advantaged considering the figures on\ntheir pay, then for the low-income earners, such as many freelance female journalists, the situation\nis likely to be worse as their male colleagues take advantage of the miserable economic situations\nto violate them. This shows that in some societies, regardless of women's economic status, sexual\nviolence takes over due to cultural beliefs.\n\nAl Jazeera (2017) notes that almost 90 percent of all Ugandan women have experienced sexual\nviolence in some way or the other.

The disparity in the results of the two studies may be caused by the level of awareness of the\ntargeted samples about sexual violence with the higher percentage of 90 belonging to rural women,\nwho have limited awareness of their rights and the lesser percentage of 13 belonging to urban\nwomen, who actually do know their rights, but face challenges to defend them.\n\nIn her study, Uganda Women near Parity but still leaving media houses in which Kaija (2013) focuses\non the tough media house environment and the demand journalism places on female journalists,\nsome of the respondents notice that the media houses are characterized by gender segregation and\nsexual violence and yet no one takes the issues seriously. One of the interviewees in the study said\nshe survived the practice because her senior supervisor kept advising her on how to deal with it\nunlike her colleagues who had no mentors. Meanwhile, the (IWMF) global survey whose results were\nreleased in 2014, had a chilling testimony of a respondent from Uganda, narrating how one day her\nsupervisor summoned her to his office and forced her to watch a sexually explicit movie on his\ncomputer. She said that he wanted her to get into the sexual mood like the way he was feeling. He\ngrabbed her hand and forcefully made it touch his erected penis and top of that kissed her on the\nlips.

And these are, the natural/biological, organizational, and social cultural models.\nThe social-cultural model says sexual violence is a result of the larger patriarchal system in which\nmale power is abused in a male dominated environment or society while, the organizational model\nsays that that organizational hierarchies, do provide the opportunity for exploitation sexually. Yet,\nthe natural/biological model says that sexual violence reflects the urge drive for males to be sexually\naggressive. These three models are common in most of the media houses in the different parts of\nthe world especially those dominated or taken up by the men in terms of numbers and positions they\nhold.\n\nAccording to Haruna et al., (2016), sexual violence can also be caused by poverty as victims crave\nfor financial favors from their superiors without intending to offer them sexual favors. The superiors\nmay take advantage and demand sexual favors. In many African media houses where there is a\ndifference in payment between female and male journalists sexual violence is most definitely likely\nto continue happening. Sexual violence at the workspace is also caused by a provocative dress code\nof the victim or at times her behavior (Cates, 2012). Although, this argument assumes that men\ncompletely lack self-control over their sexual desires. And citing Suzan Faludi, the author of\nBacklash: The Undeclared War Against American Women, Minnesota University website points out\nthat some men violate women because they perceive their goal of achieving social-economic equality\nas a challenge to their traditional roles of providers in their families. \"Because of that women are\nusually subjected to discrimination and given weak job assignments, low payment and less chances\nof promotion which is accompanied by sexual violence to humiliate and embarrass them.\"\n2.6\nEffect of Sexual Violence\nHenshall (2012) notices that sexual violence causes more threats which many women feel too scared", "word_count": 362, "start_char": 35803, "end_char": 38135}

North (2016), notes that sexual violence is\none of the issues that kills a woman's confidence and strips away her identities as an equal participant\nin the organization that sometimes, the victim stops making eye contact and male friendships with\nmale colleagues at the workspace. Victims of sexual violence are damaged physically, emotionally\nand psychologically (Natukunda, 2017). Citing the 2015 Action Aid report, titled Safe Cities for\nWomen, Natukunda (2017) noted that the too much fear of sexual violence has forced women in the\nworld all over to change their walking directions in cities; from being able to work in certain places,\nusing commuter buses or even taking night classes at some universities. Many of the female\njournalists' careers and promotion opportunities have also been hindered by among other things, a\nworkplace characterized by male dominancy culture that promotes sexual violence, a lack of equal\nopportunity policies and the imbalanced allocation of less prestigious soft news stories to female\njournalists (North, 2016). Economically, due to sexual violence, female journalists are sometimes\ntreated differently from their male colleagues when it comes to payment, with them receiving a\nbetter salary package and social insurance benefits (Leina, 2011). This is exemplified by a depressing\nfact about gender parities in payments of female journalists in the United States that appears in a\nrecent report, \"Women and the Media in the US\", showing that Angelina Jolie, the highest paid female\nfilm star, makes about the same per movie as each of the two lowest paid male stars, Denzel\nWashington and Liam Neeson among the top 10 for each sex (Alter, 2014).\n\nSexual violence at the work space, according to the University of Minnesota website may also force\nwomen to forego a chance for a promotion if they refuse to give in their bodies to the person in\nauthority demanding for sex. The practice puts pressure on women resulting in loss of morale, stress\nand keeping women in the lower positions of their jobs for fear of elevating up to face even more\nchallenging problems. In many media houses, especially in the developing economies including in\nUganda, as a result of discrimination/violence, lack of skills and experience, many female journalists\ncan only work as freelance journalists, meaning that they do not have a chance to be assigned to\n\ncover big political and business stories to also shine like their male colleagues (Kaija, 2013).

The failure to retain\nthe good female talent also threatens the ability of companies to draw new and diverse audiences\nas well as to innovate and adapt in the rapidly changing world (Cramer & Creedon, 2007). This is\nbecause of the poor retention rate of female journalists in the media houses that the Global Media\nMonitoring Project (GMMP), a grassroots monitoring, research and advocacy project, in its reports\nhighlights a worldwide gender difference in the media houses (Mannila, 2017). Data from the GMMP\nindicated that in 2015, women made up only 24 percent of the people heard, read about or seen in\nthe news. The superiority of males in the media houses that results from the undervaluing of the\nfemales implies that to a significant degree whatever we see, read and listen to is structured from\nthe men's point of view despite women's increased enrolment in the media (Anyango, 2009).\n\nAccording to the Global Report on the Status of Women in Media Houses published by the IWMF in\n2011, the hurdles or difficulties women face in the media houses including sexual violence, may\nexplain why male journalists continue to outnumber them in the Ugandan media houses, with men\nnumbering 306 (58%) and women 227 (42%), a difference of over 15 percent. Yet more females\ngraduate in journalism from Ugandan universities than their male counterparts compared to many\nother countries, raising concern on where women journalists go after their university training and\ncalling for research in the area (Kaija, 2013). This raises more questions because \"in Uganda there\nare one million more women than men\" according to the 2014 population census\nreport (New Vision, 2014).\n\nA 1987 United States Chamber of Commerce report also noticed that female professionals, vicepresidents and above earn 42% less than their male colleagues (Wolf, 1990). Meanwhile, the Human\nDevelopment Report (2016) observes that in 100 countries, females including journalists are legally\nomitted from some jobs because of their gender (UNDP, 2017). And because of this, the victims delve\ninto other more conducive sectors of the economy including fashion, farming, business or even\nbecoming housewives.

In the struggle to end sexual violence, the 2014 IWMF report\nsuggested several different ways in which a female journalist can reduce exposure to the practice.\nThey include women being aware of certain critical cultural norms and practices in their communities\nor areas such as a good local dress code, covering a scarf on the head in the Muslim countries and\nalso keeping in mind that any situation and any time can directly shoot a security risk. Although,\nsome of these cultural norms come forth as old fashioned and stagnant as women were highly\ndiscriminated and segregated because of their gender. Haruna et al. (2016) suggests that sexual\nviolence in the workspace can be contained by introducing and formalizing of sanctions that are\nagainst indecent dressing.

The newspapers are Bukedde newspaper under vision group and Kasangati Times Community\nNewspaper a private owned news agency. The television stations are NTV Uganda a subsidiary of\nnation media group and UBC TV. These were selected respectively print and media houses for this\nstudy in Uganda. These media houses are developed well, organized or set well and gender balanced\nhence giving a sample required of this study. Easy accessibility is one of the reasons these four media\ngroups are selected because they are in the heart of Kampala the Capital city of Uganda.\n\nUganda Broadcasting Corporation Television (UBC TV) is the national broadcaster in Uganda.\nAccording to (http://www.pressreference.com/Sw-Ur/Uganda.html, UBC TV dominates Uganda's\ntelevision broadcasting waves because its signals cover up to 60 percent of the country and has the\nbest picture and sound quality of all active stations in the country. Until 1992 when the media\n\nindustry in the country was liberalized, UBC TV was known as Uganda Television (UTV), (Kaija, 2013).\nUTV was established in 1963 just after Uganda got her independence in 1962. The restructuring of\nUTV to UBC TV in the 1990s was done by the National Resistance Movement (NRM) government to\nreorganize the institution that had nearly collapsed following years of insecurity in the country and\nmismanagement\nof\ngovernment\nagencies.\nAccording\nto\nthe\nstation's\nwebsite\n(https://ubc.ug/index.php/contact-us/,), the core values of UBC TV which is found in the capital\nKampala include trustworthiness, fairness, integrity, professionalism and transparency although this\nis rarely reflected in some of its programmes including news that is majorly biased in favor of the\nruling party. The channel's mission is to inform, educate, guide and entertain the public through\nmaintaining national coverage while its vision is to broadcast quality programs for national\ndevelopment. According to the Kantar-Geopoll Media Measurement's daily survey on audience habits\nfor TV in 2016, UBC is among the five most famous television stations in the country.", "word_count": 371, "start_char": 46709, "end_char": 49140}

It is one of the companies owned by Aga Khan IV and it has been on air since 2006. It is located\nin the heart of Kamapala at Serena Hotel. NTV Uganda has several TV presenters and hosts with\ndifferent departments like the newsroom and others. They have quite a number of employees both\nfemale and male so basically there is gender balance at the media house. They also have a website\nwhich is ntv.co.ug. it is also important to note that NTV Uganda affiliates with Spark TV and it is in\nthe same location.\nBukedde is a daily Ugandan Newspaper that is under Vision Group. It produces daily newspapers in\nthe country in print in Luganda language with an estimated daily circulation of about 33,290 copies.\nBukedde Newspaper is available on the internet too and it is located along First Street Industrial\nArea in Kampala Uganda.

It was founded in 2021 in\nthe month of April by two Ugandan gentlemen who are passionate about journalism. That is Apollo\nand Alex. It is located in Kasangati-Gayaza, Wakiso district. They employ about 70-80 individuals\nwho cooperate as at team to look for news stories, have them edited and distributed to the\ncommunity in form of print. Kasangati Times Community Newspaper also has an online platform\nwhere news is distributed, https://kasangatitimes.com/.\n3.3\nData Sources\nBoth primary and secondary data sources were used for this study. The primary data in this aspect\nwas obtained using a structured interview guide targeting some responses from female journalists in\nthe media houses. It’s also important to note that an interview is conversation where issues are\nproduced through the one-on-one talk between the interviewer and interviewee according to\n[Seidman, 2013]. Interviewing much requires that the researcher ought to have access and engage\nwith some potential participants they have actually never met before. Interviewing also requires or\ndemands that our actions as people interviewing show that other people’s stories matter and are\nimportant. Interviews happen in many ways or forms for example the use of surveys, online\ninterviews, phone call interviews, one on one engagements and so many others.\n\nInterviewing helps reconstruct events which the researcher has not experienced before such as illegal\nborder crossing to becoming a paid assassin (Rubin &Rubin, 2012). Through interviewing, researchers\ncan further build separate interviews into one to create a portrait of complicated processes.\nInterviewing the victims in something sometimes helps challenge a long-held assumption which results\ninto better programming of public policies (Rubin & Rubin, 2012). In the qualitative research approach,\nthere are mainly three types of interviews (Gill et al., 2008). These are structured, semi-structured\nand unstructured. Structured interviews, which this study adopts, are generally a verbal form where\na list of predetermined questions is put forward by the interviewer to the interviewee with little or no", "word_count": 382, "start_char": 49949, "end_char": 52460}

Bryman (2012, Pp. 208), discusses structured interviews in the following way: structured\ninterview, sometimes called a standardized interview entails the administration of an interview\nschedule by an interviewer. The aim is for all interviewees to be given exactly the same context of\nquestioning. This means that each respondent receives exactly the same interview stimulus as any\nother. The goal of this style of interviewing is to ensure that interviewees' replies can be aggregated,\nand this can be achieved reliably only if those replies are in response to identical cues. Interviewers\nare supposed to read out questions exactly and in the same order as they are printed on the schedule.\nQuestions are usually very specific and often offer the interviewee a fixed range of answers (this type\nof question is often called closed, closed ended, pre-coded, or\nfixed choice) (Bryman, 2012, Pp.208).\n\nGill et al. (2018) argues that structured interviews may not be good in circumstances that need details.\nMeanwhile, semi-structured interviews have got key questions that help to define the areas to be\nexplored and permit the interviewer and interviewee to diverge in order to pursue an idea or response\nin detail. Lastly, the unstructured interview does not show any form of preconceived theory or ideas\nand are performed with very little or no order. This type of interview could start from any point. The\nstructured interview was adopted to help aggregate the findings but was self-administered due to the\nsensitivity of the subject.\n\nInterviewing has got a number of advantages such as: easy correction of speech in cases of a\nmisunderstanding or mistake. The interviewer can also collect sufficient information because there\nis room to ask any question. However, like any other research methods, interviewing has also got\ndisadvantages. It is labor intensive demands a lot of time and sometimes finances.

These four\nmedia houses were selected because of their convenience for the researcher. Selecting both\ntelevision and print media houses was also intended to draw variations from two media house\nenvironments. Prior to collecting the data or information the researcher paid a visit to each media\nhouse and got permission from the agency or station managers. She distributed interview guides to\nrespondents at these four media houses. The researcher used convenient sampling in identifying\nparticipants for this study. The sampling method was found to be appropriate because it allowed the\nresearcher target participants who were more accessible to her and those, she suspected to have\ninformation based on their experiences in the media houses and other offices they hold. The\nrespondents in this study varied in age and experience in the media houses. The biggest challenge\nhowever in having all the interview guides returned was that there were very few female journalists\nin the media houses and because of that some respondents showed an interest in filling them but\nthey were later disinclined to participate. It is very important to understand that the researcher\nfrom the beginning depended on an estimate of the number of female journalists in the media houses\nsince there is no really a clear list of registered female journalists in any media house in Uganda.\n\nIn distributing the questions, the researcher ensured that every female journalist in the media houses\nwho was accessible got a chance to fill it.

The other\nproblem faced during data collection process was that some of the media houses have a policy that\ndoes not allow research to be conducted in their media houses. However, the researcher met some\nstaff members who understand the importance of research and so they were willing to help the\nresearcher who approached them individually for help.\nIn another media house, where the researcher carried out her research, she was assured by one of\nthe editors that if she had gone through the human resource manager as the official policy required,\nshe\nwould not have been allowed to carry out the research. The problem with this closed-door policy of\nresearch in these media houses is that there is vital information, which the researcher may not get\nby following the right procedure. The researcher in this case was unable to get some company\npolicies yet they were needed for the analysis of her data. This failure happened because some of\nthe human resources managers, who had the policies on their desks in their offices, felt that releasing\nthem to the researcher would subject their company to scrutiny. In one of the media houses, a\nmanager said, before declining to give the researcher a copy of the company code of conduct, that\nit is \"our heart; we can't let it out.\" This may explain why research in the Ugandan media industry is\nusually conducted in selected newsrooms with fair research policies.\n\n3.5\nData Collection Tools/Instruments\nResearch data can be collected using several tools and instruments but not all can be used.

This meant that the respondents were given the interview\nguides which they answered at their own convenient time and returned without their names for\nfurther confidentiality. The researcher delivered the interview questions to the respondents in their\nrespective media houses. The questions were sealed in envelops to ensure confidentiality of the\nrespondent and after filling, they returned them. Participants were asked not to put their names on\nthe question papers. The researcher used fictitious names of the respondents while presenting and\nanalyzing the data for further confidentiality.\n3.6\nEthical Consideration\nEthical considerations were part of the data collection process this researcher undertook in this\nstudy. Before collecting data, she secured her university ID from Ugandan Christian University (UCU)\nto seek permission in all the four media houses. Further to give the interviewees enough space and\nfreedom to speak freely about sexual violence in the media houses which is a sensitive topic she\nused self-administered interview guides which the respondents answered in their privacy and without\nincluding their names. The researcher handed over the interview questions to the respondents in\nenvelops, which she asked them to seal after filling such that no one else apart from her had access\nto the information. She put the questions in the envelopes after consulting some of the pilot\nrespondents, who advised accordingly. Respondents were also advised not to put their names on the\nguide and fictitious names were used to replace or represent the respondents while presenting the\ndata for further confidentiality.

The researcher then used casual content analysis, and\nthematic analysis which allowed her place the collected data into different themes for easy handling.\n3.8\nLimitations of the Study\nThis study had several limitations starting with the fact that not much research had previously been\nconducted on this topic in a Ugandan context because it is such a sensitive issue meaning that getting\nlocal literature required for laying a strong theoretical foundation has been a challenge. The fact\nthat the Ugandan culture perceives sexual violence to be normal was another limitation as many\nparticipants were not open on the topic since they thought it was either not a big issue or was very\nsensitive to discuss in public. The size of the number of female journalists in some of these media\nhouses was the other challenge because it was not easy to get the required sample size and the\nresearcher nearly involved all the female journalists. The Management of some of the media houses\nwas also not ready and willing to allow the researcher conduct the study on such a sensitive topic\nthat was likely to expose and embarrass their staff and reputation of their companies. lack of funds\nto conduct a comprehensive and thorough study was yet another limitation. By using only four media\nhouses NTV a subsidiary of Nation Media Group, UBC TV, Bukedde News Paper under Vision Group\nand Kasanagati Times Community Newspaper a private owned news agency. However, the results of\nthis study from participants give a clearer perspective of sexual violence of female journalists in the\nUgandan media houses. Lastly another limitation is that the researcher was also almost sexually\nviolated because she is female so it was a real challenge.\n3.9\nPilot Study\nThe interview guide was initially piloted among some female journalists working for a local\nnewspaper based in Kampala, where the final data collected was not harvested for this study. The\nplot study showed some challenges about the awareness and sincerity of some of the respondents in\nanswering the questions on the topic.

The fact that some respondents would even give real life examples of\nthe practice in the media houses that should have been in the public know would make one doubt\nthe sincerity of the other respondents, who answered that they were not aware of the practice.\nThere was also a challenge with the respondents who answered that they had no knowledge of sexual\nviolence in the media house, but would later give forms of sexual violence which they have\nexperienced or even observed in the media houses. In order to address this concern, the researcher\nexplained to the respondents the broader extent of sexual violence, which they had unknowingly\nexperienced or observed, such as: sexual touches from male colleagues, seemingly giving careless\nremarks about certain body parts (buttocks and breasts).\n\nDuring piloting, some respondents also missed certain questions so the researcher later requested\neach of the respondents to attempt every question. She went ahead and explained that whereas the\ngaps left for the answers were long, it did not mean that respondents were required to provide very\nlong answers, which resulted in many of them attempting all the questions. The other lesson from\nthe pilot stage was that every female journalist, regardless of age, should have the opportunity of\nfilling the interview guide because each respondent has a different experience in her age bracket.\nThis means that data collected would show the extent of the problem over the years.\n\nCHAPTER FOUR\n\nPRESENTATION AND DATA ANALYSIS\n\n4.0\nIntroduction\nThis chapter focuses on the findings and analysis of the data in line with the objectives of the study\nas listed in chapter one. The data was collected using open -ended questionnaires among 34\nparticipants in total. The results and analysis have been presented following three research\nquestions.

Although the labor laws require that employers should ensure that their\nemployees know their organization’s codes of conduct to guide them when aggrieved like in cases of\nsexual violence some said they were not aware of the organization/s code of conduct about sexual\nviolence hence there would have no basis for filing complaints against offenders of sexual violence.\n\nHowever, there are those who mentioned that they knew their organization’s codes of conduct about\nsexual violence, unfortunately half of them could not explain what they were exactly.\n\nThe data further showed that one of the four media organizations did not have a known code of\nconduct for its employees in that the disciplinary committee in this organization was not guided by\nthe code when handling complaints, including sexual violence. Although, even in others which had\ncodes of conduct, the sections dealing with sexual violence were very brief, often only mentioning\nthat the practice was unwelcome without stipulating the penalties or procedures required to file a\ncomplaint. The absence of the clear codes of conduct in some media organizations shows that there\nis less concern on disciplinary issues, especially in areas that are perceived not to have a direct\neffect on the organization’s revenue, hence allowing abuses such as sexual violence to thrive. Note\nthat whereas some of these codes were brief on details of crimes such as sexual violence, on others\nlike corruption that had a direct impact on the general revenue of the media organizations were\ndetailed\n\n4.4 Table 4 showing the number of categories of males who sexually violated the respondents\nCategory of people who sexually violated\nfemale journalists in the media houses\nTotal number of categories of people who\nviolated female journalists in the media\nhouses\nBosses\ncolleagues\nBoth colleagues and bosses\n\nIn many media houses of Uganda, when a journalist is promoted to a bigger post such as editor or\nnewsroom supervisor and Programmed Director [PD], it is like a reward to earn more money and\nenjoy other benefits like making decisions of which ads should run on TV or news stories.

A cross section of Ugandans believes that\nwhen you are appointed to an influential office, it is your turn to reap benefits, and that is one of\nthe reasons why bosses in certain offices are like African kings with powers to prey on women and\ncarry out other forms of abuse.\n\n4.5 Forms of Sexual Violence\n\n4.5.1. Unwanted physical contact\nThis was the most common form of sexual violence of female journalists in the media houses and in\nthe field. The form came in several ways such as; touching and caressing of sensitive body parts,\nforceful kissing, forceful hugging with pressing of the breasts, and holding hands for long while\ntickling them. Overall, unwanted physical contact was mentioned by the respondents. Nearly all the\nrespondents, who experienced unwanted physical touches, noted that the sensitive body parts\ntargeted by the perpetrators of sexual violence in the media houses and field included; breasts,\nbums, thighs, hair, ears and shoulders. They noted that the incidents occurred almost all the times\nthey met the perpetrators in the corridors and anywhere else inside and outside the media house\nyet the latter did not realize the effect of their actions. Carol, a news anchor journalist, said that\none day; a male colleague walked straight to her and touched her breasts before breaking into\nlaughter thinking she was excited. Nabossa who is also in the production unit in one of the media\nhouses, noted that the perpetrator found her in the control room and intentionally touches her\nbreasts claiming that they are big. However, karungi a field journalist experienced this form of sexual\nviolence during her internship at a certain news media agency and she said that during her third\nweek of internship, it was around midday and her supervisor told her that they are going in the field\ntogether that day to collect new stories, and so when they got in the car and drove off amidst the\njourney her supervisor started caressing her breasts and thighs claiming how beautiful she was.", "word_count": 363, "start_char": 70338, "end_char": 72511}

In addition to that, female journalists are also targeted and exploited\nby sources Jemimah, a newspaper journalist also shared an experience during an interview with a\nsource and she said that the interviewee seemed to have had a different agenda that when she\nentered his office, he stood up and locked the door and he began touching her breasts and later\nattempted to undress her. She further says that she was saved when his office attendant knocked on\nthe door to handover something. He immediately stopped and opened the door (Jemimah, May,\n2024).\n\nThe challenge female journalists face is that after going through such experiences, they start fearing\nto interact with the male sources and yet in a patriarchal society like Uganda, men occupy most of\nthe big offices and are therefore the major newsmakers. This leaves female journalists to put all\ntheir attention on light work in the media houses and not have the chance to go for some heavy\ntasks. Samantha a television camera female personnel went through the same situation when the\ninterviewee she met gave her a handshake where he scratched her palms which signified something\nelse. Scratching of the palms of a female while greeting her may mean demand for sex. Unwanted\ntouches is a form of sexual violence female journalists in Uganda have to live with most of the time\nbecause even when they use public means of transport to travel in the field or even to their offices\nto work, some passengers in taxis especially those that are crowded in the morning hours take\nadvantage of the congestion to touch their bodies.\n\n4.5.2 Sexist Comments\nThis form of sexual violence happens both within the media houses and in the field. This is how\nAmeria a journalist in one of the media houses and a victim of this form of sexual violence narrates\nher experience or what she went through. “My boss usually involved me in an uncomfortable\nconversation of a sexual nature and that was always hard to stop because I feared losing my job\n\ncompromising my performance if I showed less interest. He would ask me bedroom questions in front\nof everyone and this caused me a lot of shame and my confidence went down. I felt like everyone in\nthe production unit knew what I was going through and the dilemma I was in. It was the most\nembarrassing and uncomfortable time of my working life (Ameria, June, 2024).", "word_count": 445, "start_char": 72511, "end_char": 75094}

Malaika, a sub editor in one of the media agencies complained that she meets a number\nof male sources who comment in a sexual way about her body and big buttocks that is always about\nhow you have a nice body, and good behind. In a media house where journalists interact freely, this\nform of sexual violence makes victims uncomfortable and so reserved hence reducing their activity\nin the media house. This is what she said about the behavior of male sources. “I have met so many\nsources who will literally divert you the moment you step into their offices and they start asking\nquestions like when was the last time you had sex, or if you’re staying alone or with someone. They\nclearly project to you that they want to have a piece of you and hence shift the discussion to a\npersonal affair. [Malaika, June 2024].\n\nCasually, not so many female journalists like many women in Uganda look at this form as sexual\nviolence because the nature of our society allows men to patronize women at the workplace so it\nbecomes really problematic.\n\n4.5.3 Sexual Demands and Favors.\n\nRespondents noted that besides demanding that female journalists fulfil their job targets, bosses\nand colleagues ask them for sexual favors. Teopista, a television journalist narrated that one evening\none of her friends was trying to finish her day's work in the studio switching off cameras when a male\ncolleague from a different department went to where she was operating from and started demanding\n\nthat she meets him at his home after work. She narrated, \"When she asked why he wanted to meet\nher at his home, the man was Frank and said he wanted sex. in Luganda he said, [njagala kulya].", "word_count": 380, "start_char": 74784, "end_char": 76962}

Sources also target female journalists in the\nfield. Sabrina one of the news journalists in one media house narrated that she went to the media\ncenter fore an interview with a source who instead of answering her questions he was telling her\nhow beautiful she was and how he would wish to spend a night with her. So, it becomes difficult for\nfemale journalists to concentrate on work both in the newsroom and field when some of their\ncolleagues and sources look at them as sex objects.\n\n4.5.4 Rape and Attempted Sexual Assault\nThis form of sexual violence is committed by both journalists in the media houses and sources in the\nfield. Shiloh a female news anchor working for a television station explained that she narrowly\nsurvived being raped by a source in the field. She narrated and said that one time a source was in\ncharge of a particular project they had gone to cover and was supposed to pay their accommodation\nand transport but later he decides that he wants to have sex with her which she brushed off\nimmediately. She further narrates that at night he came into her room pretending to discuss some\nissues and forcefully tried to lay her on bed but she was saved by her male colleague who was passing\nby and came in handy to help her. [Shiloh, June, 2024].\n\nIn cases of rape and attempted sexual assault, victims fear coming out to report the offenders for\nfear of embarrassment, or due to lack of tangible evidence against them especially in cases of\nattempted sexual assault where no injury is inflicted. Noella, a newspaper journalist at one media\nagency observed that during fieldwork, some male organizers trap female journalists by boking them\ninto their rooms in an attempt to seduce them into having sex, especially at night. This leads to the\nresearch question examining the responses of victims and media managers to sexual violence.\n\n4.5.0 Feedback or Responses from Victims, Media Superiors\n\nIn an effort to deter off offenders of sexual violence, the female journalist who said that they had\nexperienced sexual violence in their respective media houses gave responses on how they deal with\nthe practice such as telling the offenders off, going silent or ignoring them, threatening them and\nmost beating up the offenders and also blocking them on social media.", "word_count": 446, "start_char": 76816, "end_char": 79403}

Namitala a journalist working in the newsroom narrated her experience\nand said that one time her superior the news editor touched her waist and she became so bitter and\nangry and angrily told him never to do it again but then it hit her later that she might lose her job\nbecause of the way she spoke to her superior. [ Namitala, June, 2024].\n\nNamitala however mentioned that this form of response can only apply when a victim is responding\nto a fellow colleague but not her supervisor. Queen a news journalist in one agent also mentioned\nthat from the word go she made it clear to her workmates that she will not any form of sexual\nviolence and that she has always told them off. Others also mentioned that they clearly tell off the\noffenders in their faces that they are not interested in what they are doing and they do not like it\nand hence should never repeat it again. This kind of response has challenges because Namitala also\nmentioned that usually men in our country Uganda do not take a lady’s NO serious with a perception\nthat women are always interested in such activities and its expected for them to say NO the first\ntime but eventually will pick interest which is so wrong.\n\n4.5.2 Ignoring the Offenders or Going Silent\n\nOne of the female journalists said that one time in the newsroom a male colleague touched her two\nbreasts and she was in total shock with no word to him she moved away and went mute on him and\nalso stopped interacting with male colleagues at work because it stuck in her mind that they would\nalso sexually violate her in the same way. Lucia also mentioned that she went mute when she\nreceived a WhatsApp message from the facilitator at a media function she was supposed to attend\nand cover that he wanted to sleep with her and taste her sweet waters. She immediately blocked\nhim and talked to supervisor to send another person cover the event claiming she got a medical\nemergency. In a similar way another one said that whenever her boss starts asking her for sexual\nacts during their discussion, she immediately finds a way of changing the topic.\n\n4.5.3 Quitting the Media Houses and Newsrooms", "word_count": 411, "start_char": 79403, "end_char": 81693}

Latifah went ahead to narrate her own experience and said that after\nrefusing to go to a fancy hotel from the owner of the media organization he started making her life\na place of hell especially during staff and directors’ meetings where he could pin point at her for\nbeing so negligent with her job. She further said that when she realized it was getting toxic and out\nof control, she decided to quit the job and after some days they pleaded with her to return because\nsome duties that would push the media house were supposed to be done specifically by her.\n\nKyomuhindo also said that she received a lot of forced kisses from one of the male superior male\neditors in the newsroom and she requested to stop being part of the team in the newsroom but she\nwas hesitant because she feared losing her job at the same time.\n\n4.5.4 Beating the Offenders\n\nPetrina a female news anchor noted that on many occasions she slapped the so-called sexual\n\noffenders who had gone ahead to sexually violate her even when she gave them strong warnings and\nthreats. She said that she would slap them because the top authorities would not listen or come to\nher aid because of too much pretense and corruption in the working space acting as though the\npractice was normal.\n\nAnother one mentioned that she nearly slapped her boss who touched her buttocks intentionally\nInfront of all her colleagues claiming that they were too big. She decided not to show up for work\nfor a full week due to the embarrassment she faced.\n\n4.5.5 Blocking Offenders on Social Media\n\nRespondents violated by sexual offenders on social media platforms like WhatsApp, telegram, twitter\ncurrently called X said that they don’t reply, block their accounts and if the habit keeps on, they\nreport the case to police. They also said in this new era opening up a social media account is easy\njust as blocking off the offenders the only challenge is where these sexual offenders open up new\naccounts to get back at their targets.\n\n4.5.6 Challenges in Seeking Justice\n\nFemale journalists face significant challenges when attempting to seek justice against the sexual\noffenders.\n\n4.5.7 Lack of Evidence", "word_count": 450, "start_char": 81350, "end_char": 83974}
{"chunk_id": "DOC0107__00036", "doc_id": "DOC0107", "chunk_index": 36, "text": "Lack of evidence against offenders of sexual violence is a common challenge which women in the\nmedia houses and elsewhere in the communities highly face. Respondents said that when a victim\ntakes a step to report cases of sexual violence to their bosses or high authorities, they always tell\nthem that they cannot act without evidence against the offenders. And it so happens that these\n\noffenders do such practices when no one is watching or target when people are really few. The lack\nof CCTV cameras inside the newsrooms and production spaces to identify suspects or offenders and\nalso in cases where someone witnesses an act of sexual violence, it is hard to convince them to\ntestify against the offender due to fear of loosing work relationships with colleagues.\n\n4.5.7 Absence of the Codes of Conduct\n\nSome respondents noted that they have never actually seen a code of conduct that stipulates how\nsexual violence in the media house should be dealt with however there is a disciplinary board that\nhandles general indiscipline and cases. So, this leaves them lost and in the dark regarding seeking\njustice against the offenders in case of sexual violence. Some victims as well do not know the forms\nof sexual violence if they are a crime which implies that even if they are traumatized with the act,\nthey have to always let it go because it seems normal to some people.\n\n4.5.8 Threats by Male Bosses\nSome respondents noted that female journalists in the media houses or newsrooms are always\nthreatened by their bosses or superiors. They threaten them of losing their jobs and making their\nlives hard if they keep on seeking useless justice and some blame them that it is because of their\ntempting dressing that leads them to act the way they act. Some female interns also said that if they\nfile a case against sexual violence, it so happens that they lose the opportunity of not being helped\nat the media house with different tasks and end up being ignored until one chases themselves out.\n\n4.5.9 The fear of being perceived as Timid\nA certain respondent mentioned and said that victims do not want to be looked as weak or timid if\nthey report any form of sexual violence so they choose to be calm and silent. Nantaba said that she\ndid not report the male colleague who caressed her private parts in the production room by force\nfor fear of being labelled cheap and sidelined by other male colleagues. She also said that some\n\ndepartments in the media house are male dominated and they think sexual violence to female\njournalists is normal.", "word_count": 442, "start_char": 83974, "end_char": 86519}

In attempt to seek justice against the practice, victims\nface so many challenges like lack of evidence, absence of the codes of conduct, threats by male\nbosses and the fear of being perceived as timid.\n\nCHAPTER FIVE\n\nCONCLISION AND RECOMENDATIONS\n5.1 Conclusion\nSeveral revelations concerning sexual violence of female journalists in the Uganda Media Houses,\nReponses from the victims and media managers as well as challenges in seeking justice as presented\nbelow;\n\nWhat has come out in this study is that sexual violence of female journalists exists in the Ugandan\nmedia houses, cases of sexual violence were identified and escalated, management's reaction was\nconstrained by a patriarchal interpretation underpinned by traditional understandings of gender\nrelations. Respondents were also of the view that media managers who were males, were sometimes\nthe culprits in such cases. Furthermore, the absence and ignorance of codes of conduct made little\nimpact in restraining the risk to female employees. Incidentally, the media industry in Uganda, which\nhas all along been at the forefront of fighting other injustices against the vulnerable appears to have\nfailed to notice the danger of the practice and eliminate it. Some male journalists defend their male\ncolleagues engaging in the practice to the extent of refusing to provide evidence against them during\nthe disciplinary hearing and also blame the victims, who file complaints against offenders for acting\nin an immature way. Therefore, unless something is done urgently to address the practice, sexual\nviolence of female journalists in the newsroom and media houses will continue to go on. This leads\nto the following recommendations on how to curb sexual violence in the Ugandan media houses.", "word_count": 363, "start_char": 86189, "end_char": 88508}

Recommendations\nThere are several ways in which sexual violence of female journalist in Ugandan media houses can\nbe addressed. For instance; sensitizing media managers to take sexual violence seriously, giving\nsevere punishments to the offenders such as permanent dismal and also clearly stating what\nconstitutes sexual violence and penalties. The purpose of the recommendation is to empower female\njournalist to deter sexual violence as stated below;\n5.3.1. installation of CCTV Cameras\nOne of the most effective ways to deal with sexual violence in the media houses is by installing CCTV\nCameras to record whatever happens on a daily basis such that in case of incidents of sexual violence\nlike rape, unwanted physical touches, forced kisses and many more so that investigations are done\nwith the help of evidence got from the footage.\n\n5.3.2. Severe Punishments\nGiving severe punishments to the offenders can help deal with sexual violence of female journalist\nin the media houses. It is also important to note that sexual violence sprouts up a lot in the Ugandan\nmedia houses because there are no severe punishments imposed on the culprits. Victims said that\nwhen a complaint is filed against the offenders, there are no serious measures taken on them but\ninstead they are cautioned and left to continue with the practice. For sources that sexually violate\nfemale journalists, the Ugandan government should come up with severe punishments for men who\nsexually violate women.", "word_count": 279, "start_char": 88240, "end_char": 89993}

Effective use of Codes of Conduct and Putting them into action\nMedia houses should enforce the codes of conduct in the different departments and implent policies\non sexual violence and serious action must be taken. Media houses in Uganda should have clear\npolicies on how to deal with sexual violence, victims noted that so many times when they file cases\nand complaints against the offenders, most media managers ignore the codes of conduct to deal with\nthe practice.\n5.3.4. Sensitization of Journalists and Media Managers\nThe other recommendation would be sensitization of both journalists and media managers on what\nexactly constitutes sexual violence. In the data, the respondents showed ignorance about what\nsexual violence constitutes and whether it is a practice woman in the newsrooms should worry about.\nSome of the victims preferred to go mute about their experiences not knowing where to begin from\nand the repercussions of their responses. Others considered certain forms of the practice such as\ndemand for sexual favors by their male colleagues as the norm, which is in line with their cultures.\nWomen in many cultures in Uganda and Africa are brought up with one clear and consistent emphasis\nby their parents to appease and hold men in high regard. Some media managers also treat sexual\nviolence as a joke and even laugh it off whenever victims approach them with a complaint and they\n\nsometimes blame the victims for tempting their male colleagues underscoring the need for\nsensitization of media managers. Therefore, besides the need to sensitize female journalists about\nwhat sexual violence entails, there is need to empower them through sensitization to report\noffenders.", "word_count": 325, "start_char": 89660, "end_char": 91693}
