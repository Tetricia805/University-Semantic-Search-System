Although the plant has the capacity to manage human excreta from both\nthe onsite and offsite sanitation facilities, there is high solid loading due to the\nincoming large volumes of waste what exceed the design capacity of the plant and a\nproblem of longer drying periods than intended. There is need for optimum utilisation\nof the sludge drying beds and the treatment plant all together. This study aimed at\nassessing the use of water treatment sludge granules coated with poly aluminium\nchloride from water treatment sludge to enhance dewatering of fecal sludge.\nThe raw fecal sludge samples were analysed for parameters of pH, electrical\nconductivity, moisture content and total solids. Water treatment sludge was also\ncharacterised using the X-ray fluorescence technique so as to determine whether the\ncontent of aluminium oxide present is suitable for the preparation of poly aluminium\nchloride.\nWater treatment sludge granules coated with poly aluminium chloride showed potential\nin dewatering of fecal sludge with the lowest moisture content of 25.3% and maximum\ntotal solids of 74.7% achieved with the 4g/l dosage.\n\nii\n\nDECLARATION\nI, MUHWEZI ANDREW NDAMIRA hereby declare that this is my original work, is not\nplagiarised and has not been submitted to any institution for any award.\n\nName: MUHWEZI ANDREW NDAMIRA\nSignature: ......................\nDate: ...............\n\niii\n\nThis is to certify that all the works in this report was done by MUHWEZI ANDREW\nNDAMIRA and is ready for submission with approval.\n\nProject supervisor: ELEANOR WOZEI (PhD)\nSignature: ...................\nDate: ...........................\n\niv\n\nDEDICATION\nI dedicate this research work my family which has supported me throughout my\nacademic journey.\n\nv", "word_count": 371, "start_char": 0, "end_char": 2456}

Management of fecal\nsludge is an important practice in sanitation maintenance and some of the activities\nand techniques include storage, collection, transportation, treatment and then\ndisposal. On site facilities such as pit latrines, toilets, pour flash latrines and septic\ntanks are used in fecal sludge management at household levels (Emmanuel, 2019). In\nthe world today, around 2.7 billion people are estimated to live in areas without proper\nsanitary facilities. According to the estimate world population of 5 billion people by\n2030 (WHO, 2014), around 1 billion of the onsite sanitation facilities will be located in\nurban areas (Hu et al., 2016) which would increase the amount of fecal sludge\ngenerated and thus require management. This provides a big challenge in the effective\nmanagement of sludge in developing countries for example looking at the Republic of\nUganda where over 90% of the population depends on the onsite sanitation facilities\nwhich are operated and maintained through empting, transporting and then treatment\nat the different fecal sludge treatment facilities (Gibson et al., 2018). Looking at\nKampala, around 390 m3/day of fecal sludge is produced with an addition of 150 m3/day\nfrom the neighbouring districts. All this sludge is transported to Lubigi fecal sludge and\nwastewater treatment plant. This plant operates under the National Water and\nSewerage Corporation and is located in Namungoona. It was commissioned in 2014 with\na design capacity of 500 m3/day of wastewater and 400 m3/day of fecal sludge. For the\nfecal sludge section, the plant operates at 50% over the design capacity (KCCA, 2020).\n\nWater treatment sludge refers to the residue produced from the water treatment\nprocesses of coagulation, flocculation and sedimentation. The Ggaba III water\ntreatment plant produces about 113000 metric tons of water treatment sludge per year\n(Muhabuzi el al., 2023). The sludge contains aluminium salts such as aluminium\nhydroxide as the largest component, non-toxic elements and organic matter (Shi et al.,\n2023). It is considered as waste and it is ever increasing due to treatment of water on\na daily basis. Some water treatment plants consider managing the water treatment\nsludge through disposing it off to the landfills but scientific research has been or is\nbeing done to utilise this sludge through sustainable resource management.", "word_count": 396, "start_char": 13088, "end_char": 15652}

The sludge currently dries for 6-\n8 months although the sludge drying beds were designed with a drying period of 1-2\nmonths (site visit, 2024). This is attributed to the stickiness in sludge that makes the\nsolid liquid separation process slow and thus exceeding the design period of 4 weeks\n(Rost, 2018). The plant has 48 sludge drying beds with with a capacity of 71 m3. The\nunits are lined with sand filtering membrane on top of the gravel to allow slow sludge\ndewatering through infiltration (Lindberg, 2018). The remaining semisolid is left to dry\nfor about 4-8 weeks and further stored for 6 months to remove pathogens making it\nsuitable and safe for use (Rost, 2018; Velkushanova et al., 2021). The slow dewatering\nmay also be a result of clogging of the filter beds, particle size of sand and the mix\nratios of the sludge (Ngabirano, 2023). There is need to quicken the dewatering process\nand such that its then disinfected allow safe use for other applications like agriculture,\nmaking of fire briquettes. This project aimed at using water treatment sludge granules\ncoated with poly aluminium chloride obtained from water treatment sludge to enhance\nthe dewatering process of fecal sludge in the sludge drying beds at Lubigi Fecal sludge\nand waste water treatment plant.\n\n1.3 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\n1.3.1 Main objective\nThe main objective of this research study is to access the use of water treatment sludge\ngranules coated with poly aluminium chloride to enhance the dewatering of fecal\nsludge.\n1.3.2 Specific objectives\nTo determine the parameters of fecal sludge. (Moisture content . pH, electrical\nconductivity and total solids)\nTo determine the parameters of water treatment sludge.\nTo evaluate the enhancement in dewatering of fecal sludge achieved with using water\ntreatment granules coated with poly aluminium chloride.\n1.4 Research questions\nWhat are the parameters of fecal sludge at Lubigi fecal sludge and waste water\ntreatment plant?\nWhat are the parameters of water treatment sludge?\nHow much dewatering of fecal sludge in sludge drying beds can be achieved with the\nuse of water treatment sludge granules coated with Poly aluminium chloride?", "word_count": 431, "start_char": 15328, "end_char": 17983}

With the\n\nincreasing challenges in fecal sludge management in developing countries and given the\nincrease in the population increases the generation of fecal sludge. This triggers the\nneed to look into potential ways of reducing the sludge and this could be through\ndecreasing the dewatering time as well as ensuring safe use of this fecal sludge after it\nhas been treated.\nWater treatment sludge refers to the residue generated during the water treatment\nprocess and this sludge contains not only aluminium compounds but also other non toxic\nelements and organic matter (Shi et al., 2023). The dried water treatment also contains\naluminium based salts and this increases the settling velocity of the solid sludge thus\nenhancing the dewatering the dewater ability although the properties of this sludge\ncould be improved as the sludge is reacted with poly aluminium chloride. The dried\nwater treatment sludge contains aluminium hydroxide which when reacted with\nhydrochloric acid dissolves the aluminium salt and removing undissolved solids thus\nforming a solution containing aluminium chloride.\nAl(OH)3(aq) + 3HCl(aq) → AlCl3(aq) + 3H2O(l)\nThe solution is further reacted with water to undergo hydrolysis thus forming aluminate\nspecies that enhance the formation of poly aluminium chloride. The obtained solution\nis then reacted with sodium hydroxide in the polymerization process to yield a solution\ncontaining poly aluminium chloride (Adamu, 2023)\nAl(OH)3(aq) + NaOH(aq) → Aln(OH)mCl3n-m (aq) + nNaCl(aq)\nPoly aluminium chloride produced from the reaction of the water treatment sludge with\nhydrochloric acid and through the polymerisation process has stable polymer chains", "word_count": 314, "start_char": 17774, "end_char": 19841}

This enables it to\neffectively bind the suspended solid and colloidal particles into large particles thus\nfacility solid – liquid separation (Jin, 2016). This helps in enhancing the dewatering\nprocess. The end product from polymerisation contain sodium chloride which is also a\ngood component to enhance the dewatering of sludge because its efficient in changing\nthe surface charges and viscosity, the calcium ions compress the colloid double layers\n(Xinhau, 2013).\n1.6 Significance of the study\nImproving the dewatering process of the fecal sludge reduces the sludge volumes being\nhandled at the plant which serves as a key component for the fecal sludge management.\nThis also provides a better and efficient method for the treatment of sludge in that the\nrisks associated with the pathogens are minimised such that the fecal sludge can be\nsafely used for other uses without compromising the health of the users. This would\nalso address the sustainable development goal number 6 of the United Nations which\naims at ensuring proper management of sanitation.\nUtilising Poly aluminium chloride from water treatment sludge granules also promotes\nthe sustainable practice in waste water management and resource management\n(Debasree, 2024).\n\nCHAPTER 2: LITERATURE REVIEW\n2.1 Water treatment sludge\nWater treatment sludge refers to the by-product from the purification process of\ndrinking water. It is generated from both the sedimentation process, sand filters and\nthe back washing process during the cleaning of the filters. This sludge contains\naluminium oxide and other non-toxic elements such as silicon dioxide, calcium oxide,\nmagnesium oxide, iron (III) oxide and sodium oxide (Zhao et al., 2021).\nTable 1: Percentage composition of water treatment sludge\ncomponents\nPercentage composition\nAhmad et al., 2016\nNaayo, 2024\nSiO2\n52.78\n58.955\nAl2O3\n14.38\n38.614\nFe2O3\n5.2\n2.031\nCaO\n4.39\n9.499\nK2O\n3.62\n0.177\nMgO\n3.08\n-\nNaO2\n0.97\n-\nTiO2\n0.61\n-\nP2O5\n0.17\n0.403\nMnO\n0.08\n8.71\nZnO\n0.01\n-\nTiO2\n-\n0.443\n\nCr2O3\n-\n0.731\nCl\n-\n0.051", "word_count": 381, "start_char": 19458, "end_char": 21924}

Currently, a few practices have\nbeen developed to manage this waste and these include resource recovery, use of water\ntreatment sludge as an adsorbent for heavy metals as well as the use of this water\ntreatment sludge in brick making (Dassanayake et al., 2015). Water treatment sludge\nfrom Ggaba III\n\n2.2 Fecal sludge\nFecal sludge refers to the human waste collected from onsite sanitation facilities such\nas pit latrines, ventilated improved pit latrines, composting latrines and septic tanks.\nWaste in the septic tanks decomposes over time and before it is transported to the\ntreatment plant using cesspool emptier trucks to treatment plants (Reno, 2015).\nFecal sludge may be categorised basing on its concentration in categories such as liquid\nfecal sludge, slurry fecal sludge, semi-solid fecal sludge and solid fecal sludge (Strande,\n2021). Fecal sludge may also be further catergorised basing on the methods of\ntreatment and these include digested sludge, primary sludge, mixed sludge and mineral\nsludge.\n\n2.2.1 Management of fecal sludge in Uganda\nManagement of fecal sludge in Uganda has been predominantly handled by National\nWater and Sewerage Corporation, NWSC and Kampala Capital City Authority, KCCA for\nKampala along with other stakeholders that are either directly or indirectly involved.\nKCCA provides environmental certificates and regulates private operators, National\nEnvironment Management Authority issues fecal waste transportation licenses while\nNWSC provides treatment plants (Laker, 2020). Fecal sludge in Kampala is handled and\ntreated at Lubigi fecal sludge and waste water treatment plant which has a fecal sludge\ntreatment capacity of 400m3/day. According to UNICEF, management of fecal sludge\nhelps reduce risk of waterborne disease outbreaks in communities.\nFecal matter from pit latrines and septic tanks in Kampala is collected and transported\nto Lubigi fecal sludge and waste water treatment plant where it is treated before use\nfor agricultural practices, research, making of fire briquettes and so on. The main\nmodes of fecal sludge emptying and transportation technologies used in Kampla include\nmechanised cesspools and semi mechanised gulpers (FSM alliance, 2023).\n\nFigure 1 Sanitation service chain (Medland et., 2016)", "word_count": 440, "start_char": 21605, "end_char": 24482}

The plant has a capacity of 5000m3/day for waste water and\n400m3/day for fecal sludge. This waste Is collected and delivered to the plant where it\ngoes through primary, secondary and tertiary treatment.\n2.2.3 stages of treatment\nScreening\nScreening is the removal of solid materials in waste water using fine and course screens.\nSelection of type of screen to use depends on the septage composition and the\nrequirements of the treatment process (Tayler, 2018). The smaller the size of the\nspacing with low velocity flow, the higher the efficiency of the plant and regular\nmaintenance is required for removal of trapped solids (Rost, 2018).\n8mm screens are used to trap physical contaminants of relatively big size that flow\nalong with waste water. These contaminants include pampers, sanitary pads, leaves,\npolythene bags, plastic bottles and so on. Removal of these objects helps prevent\nblockages and clogging id the system. The screens are occasionally cleaned using a rake.\n\nFigure 2 8mm screens at Lubigi\nGrit chamber\nThe grit chamber is used to remove grit particles in waste water that are fine enough\nto go through the bar screens. Grit includes fine sand soils and gravel. In this chamber,\nflow is slowed down so as to allow settlement of the particles. Grit that settles at the\nbottom is routinely removed manually using spades so as to maintain the efficiency of\nthe process.\nGrit removal is a basic consideration for plants designed to receive a loading greater\nthan 250m3/day and plants that use enclosed systems such as anaerobic ponds and\nsludge drying beds (Niwagaba, 2014). That plant is designed to receive 400m3/day thus\nqualifies to have this chamber as part of the treatment processes.\n\nFigure 3 Grit chamber\nSedimentation chamber\nThe fecal waste from the grit chamber is directed into the sedimentation tank. Lubigi\nFecal sludge and waste water treatment plant has two sedimentation chambers which\noperate in turns that is to say that one chamber is loaded for up to 3 months as the\nother is being dislodged.\n\nFigure 4 Sedimentation tank", "word_count": 396, "start_char": 24263, "end_char": 26706}

The\norganic load produces anaerobic conditions that is there is no dissolved oxygen in the\npond. These ponds function like open septic tanks and work efficiently in warm\nclimates. The liquid effluent is retained in the ponds for about 4 days and then proceeds\nto the secondary stage of treatment (Verbyla, 2017).\n\nFigure 5 Aerobic pond\nThe plant has shallow anaerobic ponds that receive liquid effluent from the\nsedimentation tanks. The anaerobic bacteria in the ponds breaks down the waste water\nand decomposes the it thereby forming sludge. The sludge is periodically removed using\ns dredging system. The anaerobic process results into formation of methane, ammonia\nand carbon dioxide (Aziza, 2022). These gases are toxic and do not support life of\nmultiple eco systems.\nFacultative ponds\nFacultative ponds can be classified into primary and secondary facultative ponds where\nthe primary facultative ponds receive raw waste water while the secondary facultative\n\nponds receive settled waste water (Chen et al., 2018). These ponds reduce on the\nbiochemical oxygen demand. Facultative ponds are a combination of aerobic and\nanaerobic ponds. The top zone has aerobic conditions while there are anaerobic\nconditions in the lower zones.\nTertiary treatment\nThis a system of treatment designed for nutrient removal and filtering of waste particles\nthat might damage sensitive ecosystems. The wastewater is passes through additional\nfiltering lagoons to remove the nutrients. Some of the methods usi=ed at this phase\ninclude sand filtration which helps remove particulate matter, enhanced biological\nphosphorous removal where specific bacteria called polyphosphate accumulate\norganisms that store phosphate in their tissue.\n2.2.4 Challenges faced in fecal sludge management.\nThere is a challenge of rapidly growing population which requires expansion of existing\nfacilities so as to handle fecal sludge and waste generated (Basika, 2024). There is also\na challenge of unauthorised stakeholders involved in management of fecal sludge. A\nsurvey conducted under the Kampala fecal sludge management project showed that\nthere were 15 trucks and 20tricycles operating yet not legalised to operate (KCCA,\n2018).\n2.3 Sludge drying beds\nThese are either open or covered beds that use sand as a filtration medium for sludge\nfrom the sedimentation and the anaerobic ponds to allow drying of the sludge.

The pumped sludge is left to dry by evaporation\nand water percolating through the filter media of the bed (Gava, 2021).\n2.4 Poly aluminium chloride\nPoly aluminium chloride is an inorganic chemical with large polymers and that consists\nof monomers such as Al(OH)2+, Al(OH)2, dimers such as Al2(OH)24+, and trimer Al3(OH)45+\n(Chen et al., 2018). Poly aluminium chloride is a superior aluminium based coagulant\nused for particulate matter removal and removal of small particles, heavy metals and\nprecipitation of phosphates. This chemical has the ability to reduce the volatile\nsuspended solids in that it aggregates the sludge flocs causing a more tightly bound\nextracellular polymeric substances remain in the sludge flocs (Chen et al., 2018).\n\nCHAPTER 3: METHODOLOGY\n3.1 Introduction\nThis chapter consists of the different series of steps that were taken when conducting\ndata collection, analysis methods and materials that were used in order to achieve the\nobjectives of this study.\n3.2 Area of study\nIn this study, the fecal sludge to be sampled is delivered from cesspool trucks from\nonsite sanitation facilities.

The mixture was then placed in collapsible aluminium\ncups and moulded into a pellet using a bench top press TP 20E set at 200KN. The pellet\nwas then analysed using a Rayonsx PAN analytical Epsilon1 X-Ray spectrometer to\ndetermine the chemical composition of the water treatment sludge.\n3.4.2.3 Preparation of water treatment sludge granules\n100g of starch, an organic binder was added to 400g of water treatment sludge and\nmixed with 220ml of distilled water. the mixture was kneaded in a basin until a uniform\npaste was made.

This was done so as to improve on their water resistance through thermal\nmodification (Lui Zhang, 2019).\n3.4.2.4 Preparation of Poly aluminium chloride\n80g of water treatment sludge was placed in a glass beaker and 270ml of 1M\nhydrochloric acid was added to the sludge and then stired for 20 minutes so as to\ndissolve the aluminium ions present in the sludge (Wang et al., 2020 ). 550ml of distilled\nwater waere then added to the mixture and stirred for 5 minutes to dissolve the\naluminium chloride ( Lui et aj., 2019). The mixture was then filtered and 1M sodium\nhydroxide added to synthesise a poly aluminium chloride solution.

A high pH causes the\naggregated particles to re-disperse because of the direct correlation that exists\nbetween the size of the particles and the pH which later leads to disintegration (Xuan\nLui et al., 2012). The pH test on the fecal sludge samples gave a neutral pH with an\naverage value of 7.5. This offers am optimum environment to support the addition of a\nchemical conditioner.\nMoisture content influences the mechanical properties of fecal sludge and this affects\nits handling and final disposal process (Van Haandel and lettinga, 1994). An average\nmoisture content of 72.6% was obtained and this falls within the range of < 75% of\nmoisture content which indicates that the sludge is solid sludge and therefore a\nchemical conditioner would enhance the dewatering efficiency of sludge (Strande ).\nTotal solids concentration comes from a variety of organic and inorganic matter\ncomprised of floating, settleable matter, colloidal material and matter in solution\n(Niwagaba, 2014). The average value of total solids obtained was 27.4% and this value\nfalls within range of 15-40% which suggests that the sludge is solid sludge (Strande).\n4.3 Water treatment sludge\nFollowing the understanding of the sludge parameters that influence the rate of\ndewatering, there is need to comprehend the chemical characteristics of a conditioner,\nthat is water treatment sludge granules coated with poly aluminium chloride.
