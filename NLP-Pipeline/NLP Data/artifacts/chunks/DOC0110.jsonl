The study explored the impact of volunteering in an agency and\nits impact on self-satisfaction in Bukhalu sub-county, Bulambuli District. Specifically, the study\nexplored the different volunteering types that exist and the impact of volunteering in an agency on\nself-satisfaction in Bukhalu sub-county, Bulambuli District. The study also investigated factors\nthat hinder volunteering in an agency in Bukhalu sub-county, Bulambuli District. The study used\nqualitative case study design to analyze data from the study area with the help of both qualitative\nand quantitative methods. The researcher collected data from 15 respondents in the study area who\nwere selected using simple random and purpose sampling and questionnaires together with\ninterview guide were used to collect data. The study discovered that volunteering in schools is one\nform of volunteering available. Others are corporate volunteering, community volunteer work and\nwelfare volunteering is a form of volunteering. Findings show that volunteering is relevant for\npeople of all ages as a source of social capital and goodwill and this helps to enhance selfsatisfaction it is an important pathway for enhancing youth employment and employability,\naddress and volunteering is associated with better mental health in older adulthood. Findings\nfurther revealed that because volunteering could enlarge social network size, its effects would be\nmore pronounced for people who have fewer social contacts. Additionally, findings show that\nfactors that have been identified as hindering volunteering in formal organizations include a lack\nof time or interest and health problems and people don’t have information about where to\nvolunteer, or if they do, the jobs are not meaningful or purposeful as well as absence of\nvolunteering programmes for people hinder volunteering in an agency. Other findings show that\npotential volunteers can be discouraged by formal recruitment procedures such as completing a\nlong registration form or attending interviews.

Religion, broadly defined, is a system of beliefs and practices\nconcerning the relationship between humanity and the supernatural, often involving rituals, moral\ncodes, and a sense of community. It provides meaning and purpose in life, explaining the origin\nand nature of the universe and human existence (Niels, 2028). Cultural stereotyping is the\ntendency to assign general characteristics, often inaccurate and oversimplified, to an entire group\nof people based on their ethnicity, religion, nationality, or other cultural affiliations. These are\ngeneralizations that treat all members of a group as identical, ignoring individual differences and\ndiversity within the group.. Reeh perceives stereotypes as the product of basic human language\nproduction. Unfortunately, such linguistic constructions will, through frequent use, be perceived\nnot just as connotations, but also as denotations. This process generates the most dangerous result\nof stereotype use: the constitution of in-groups and out-groups in a dialectic and often\nconfrontational relationship. It is exactly this construction that may create the aforementioned\ndiscrimination and hostility. This chapter presents information about the background to the study,\nproblem statement, objectives of the study, research questions, scope of the study, and significance\nof the study, limitations and delimitations to the research study.\n1.2 Background to the study\n1.2.1 The phenomenon of volunteering in global perspective\nVolunteering is a global phenomenon with significant impacts on communities and individuals,\nplaying a vital role in addressing societal challenges and promoting sustainable\ndevelopment. While volunteerism is widespread, its forms and impact can vary across regions and\ndemographic groups, with fluctuations observed during events like the COVID-19 pandemic. The\nUnited Nations Volunteers (UNV) report, \"Building Equal and Inclusive Societies,\" highlights the\ncrucial role of volunteerism in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and emphasizes the\nimportance of partnerships between volunteers, state authorities, and other stakeholders.", "word_count": 359, "start_char": 13972, "end_char": 16602}

Volunteers are a unique and powerful force in\ndevelopment cooperation, especially when they are well prepared and supported, and when they\ncontribute to projects that are defined and designed in equitable collaboration with the local\ncommunities they serve.\nThe origin of volunteering can be traced back to 12th century Britain, where there were more than\n500 hospitals operated by volunteers. But it still cannot be excluded that people were selflessly\nhelping others even before then. In the beginning, volunteering was strongly connected to religion\nand religious institutions. Using of the word ‘volunteering’, taken from the French language, is\nfirst traceable to the 17th century, but started being used in the 18th century when people were\nwillingly joining the military service. Today, the word is not so much connected with the military\nservice, but with community service. The history of organized volunteering as we know it today\nstarts with big battles and wars when young people, and especially women would organize to help\nwounded soldiers and to collect supplies. The officially organized volunteering started in the 19th\ncentury with its peak in the early 20th century, and some of the organizations being active even\ntoday.\nThe International Forum for Volunteering in Development, commonly known as Forum, is the\nmost significant global network of Volunteering for Development organisations. Forum exists to\nshare information, develop good practice, and enhance cooperation across the volunteering for\ndevelopment sector. In 2016, Forum set out to create the first globally agreed standard for\nvolunteer involving organisations. Forum’s overarching aim in creating the Global Volunteering\nStandard was to promote and support more impactful, more responsible volunteering. To achieve\nthis, the work of volunteer involving organisations must be well-planned, transparent, and\nrespectful; and based on genuine partnerships and measurable outcomes. If we can achieve this,\nwe will ensure that volunteers make the greatest possible contribution to achieving the Sustainable\nDevelopment Goals and improving the quality of life of all the people who are supported by their\nefforts.\nThe Global Standard is the result of a collaborative global effort over three years. This project\ndrew on the expertise and wisdom of several hundred people and organisations from 80 countries\nacross the volunteering for development sector and beyond. They participated in research, surveys,", "word_count": 454, "start_char": 16145, "end_char": 19230}

In 2020, 18 organisations around\nthe world piloted the Global Standard through the process of Self-Assessment, and their experience\ninformed a review that led to the Global Standard that you are reading now. By actively engaging\na wide range of stakeholders throughout the process of developing, piloting and reviewing the\nGlobal Standard, Forum has created a resource developed by the volunteering sector, for the\nvolunteering sector. We are eternally grateful to everyone who contributed to this work, and to our\ncolleagues on the Forum Standards Working Group for their leadership.\nDuring this time, America experienced the Great Awakening. People became aware of the\ndisadvantaged and realized the cause for movement against slavery.[5] In 1851, the first YMCA in\nthe United States was started, followed seven years later by the first YWCA. During the American\nCivil War, women volunteered their time to sew supplies for the soldiers and the \"Angel of the\nBattlefield\" Clara Barton and a team of volunteers began providing aid to servicemen. Barton\nfounded the American Red Cross in 1881 and began mobilizing volunteers for disaster relief\noperations, including relief for victims of the Johnstown Flood in 1889.\nVolunteering is an elective and free-choice act of an individual or group freely giving time and\nlabor, often for community service.[1][2] Many volunteers are specifically trained in the areas they\nwork, such as medicine, education, or emergency rescue. Others serve on an as-needed basis, such\nas in response to a natural disaster. Volunteering, the act of giving one's time and skills to benefit\nothers without expecting anything in return, has become increasingly popular on a global scale. It\nhas not only captured the attention of individuals but also governments, non-profit organizations,\nand businesses.\nAround the world, more than 860 million people volunteer at least once a month, accounting for\napproximately 15% of the global population. From supplementing emergency services following natural\ndisasters, to leading youth development activities, to supporting environmental conservation, volunteers\nplay an essential role in addressing social, environmental, and economic challenges in their communities.\nTheir engagement yields a substantial impact, contributing an estimated 1.9% to GDP in OECD countries.\nDespite their importance, volunteering rates have been steadily declining in the years leading up to COVID-\n19, which further reinforced this trend. Although most recent data suggests that rates have rebounded to\nbaseline levels since, several countries are still experiencing historic lows. These underscore the urgent need\nto reinvigorate and volunteering and enhance its contributions to local development.", "word_count": 462, "start_char": 18938, "end_char": 22044}

This heightened\nawareness drives individuals to seek opportunities abroad, recognizing that their skills, time, and\nresources can make a difference in communities across borders. Additionally, the globalization of\nsocial networks and the ease of digital communication have played a crucial role in promoting\nvolunteering on a global scale. Social media platforms provide a platform for individuals to share\ntheir experiences, inspire others, and connect with like-minded individuals around the\nworld. Governments and non-profit organizations have also recognized the power of volunteering\nas a catalyst for positive change and social development. Many countries have established\ninitiatives, such as volunteer programs or grants, to encourage citizens to engage in volunteer work\nAs part of the next State of the World’s Volunteerism Report, UNV commissioned a study based\non original multi-country quantitative data to understand patterns of volunteer participation during\nthe global COVID-19 pandemic, volunteer motivations and experiences, and what these might\nmean for people’s voluntary participation in the remainder of the Decade of Action. For this study,\nnationally representative surveys with more than 8,000 people were conducted in eight countries\n- Bolivia, India, Kenya, Lebanon, Senegal, Thailand, Turkey and Uzbekistan – between March\nand April 2021.\nHowever, volunteering levels were clearly affected by the pandemic, for example by lockdowns,\nindividual circumstances, and different volunteering opportunities. In some countries,\nvolunteering declined while in others it increased during the pandemic. There is no clear pattern\nacross different countries and groups, although unemployed people were likely to volunteer less\nthan in previous year, possibly because they struggled to meet their own basic needs.\nThe situation of Volunteering in African\nVolunteering in African countries is a significant and growing phenomenon, with a large number\nof individuals engaging in both formal and informal volunteer activities. The continent is\nexperiencing a re-emergence of volunteerism as a tool for addressing development, peace, and\nsecurity challenges. While it's estimated that Africa has 12.1 million full-time equivalent\nvolunteers, the actual number is likely higher due to the prevalence of informal volunteering", "word_count": 412, "start_char": 21634, "end_char": 24557}

By 2050, one out of three young people in the world will be\nliving in Sub-Saharan Africa. The burgeoning youth population is both an opportunity and a\nchallenge for the continent. To harness this demographic opportunity, there are hurdles for the\ncontinent to overcome. One of the most significant hurdles is that of youth unemployment. While\nthe continent's significant natural resources are vital, the creativity, skills and innovation of its\nyouthful population will be the most important factor in the continent's economic transformation.\nThe African Development Bank reports that while 10 million to 12 million youth enter the\nworkforce in Africa each year, only 3 million formal jobs are created annually. Consequently, onethird of African youth are unemployed, another third are vulnerably employed, and only one in six\nare in wage employment, with informal employment accounting for more than 80 per cent of total\nemployment in the region. Most youth therefore lack access to social safety nets and sustainable\nlivelihoods. The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the situation further. The\nsituation is also complex for young girls who often face a multitude of related challenges including\nlimited access to reproductive health services and education.\nThe frustration and hopelessness of an unemployed young African population can have severe\nconsequences not only for the region, but across the world. Youth unemployment in Africa\ntranslates to poorer living conditions, fuels migration out of Africa, and contributes to conflicts\nand destabilization in the region. The good news is that Africa’s youth unemployment challenge\nis already being addressed by key African institutions and by African governments with great\nimagination, scale, and ambition. At the continental level, youth unemployment is at the heart\nof African Union’s Agenda 2063 that aims to realize an ‘integrated, prosperous and peaceful\nAfrica, driven by its own citizens, representing a dynamic force in the international arena’.\nIn line with this continental vision, several African governments have put in place ambitious\nstrategies to address the challenge. But African governments cannot act alone. Development\npartners, private foundations, and foreign institutions resident in Africa have a responsibility to\nprovide support. The severity of the challenge varies between the different sub-regions, between\ncountries and within individual countries over time. We can therefore not have one-size-fits-all\nsolutions. However, some challenges remain common across most of sub-Saharan Africa and\nlessons from different countries could be useful in others.", "word_count": 459, "start_char": 24262, "end_char": 27347}

Many organizations,\nincluding Go Volunteer Africa, Love Volunteers, and VSO, offer various programs centered in\nKampala and other parts of Uganda. Volunteers can assist in orphanages, clinics, schools, and\ncommunity development projects, contributing to education, healthcare, and social welfare.\nIn Uganda there are opportunities in a variety of fields, each of which is certain to make a decisive\ndifference to people’s lives in a country which has been blighted by problems for decades and\nwhere half of the population are under 18, many of them living on the streets. Volunteer projects\nin Uganda are centred in Kampala and include work in orphanages, clinics and hospitals, as well\nas primary and secondary schools. Volunteering overseas - particularly in a challenging\nenvironment - is an experience you will look back on with pride. It will bring a greater\nunderstanding of, and compassion for, humanity. With volunteers in Uganda coming from many\nwalks of life and generations, it is often a way of forging new and lasting friendships. Volunteering\nin Uganda gives you the chance to live amongst a population urgently requiring help.\nUganda is toward the east of Africa and borders the Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan,\nTanzania, Kenya and Rwanda. The bulk of the country comprises a plateau, which is 4,000 feet\nabove sea level. Lake Victoria occupies a large part of the south of the country. While\npredominantly Christian, Uganda has many cultures living within its borders, and several African\nlanguages are spoken. The programs that Love Volunteers is involved with have few resources\nand would find it difficult to operate without the valuable input and assistance from our volunteers\nin Uganda\nFor many of Uganda’s young graduates, the transition from school to work is encumbered by\nvarious obstacles. One of these obstacles is the lack of hands-on skills required by the labour\nmarket which Universities and other educational institutions are not able to provide.

It also fosters resilience to challenges and setbacks,\nincreased motivation, and a greater sense of purpose and happiness.

Preliminary findings further reveal that less vulnerability to\nchronic stress, longer life, Improved mood and enhanced relationships (Mwiti et a al.,\n2019). However, in Bukhalu sub-county show preliminary findings that there is lack of selfsatisfaction, particularly low self-esteem, can lead to various negative consequences,\nincluding mental health issues like depression and anxiety, as well as challenges in relationships\nand overall well-being. It can also impact decision-making, potentially leading to unhealthy\nbehaviors or unhealthy relationship patterns (in Bukhalu sub-county situational analysis report,\n2024).\nPreliminary results further show that lack of self-satisfaction, relationships, or health. Low selfesteem and a lack of confidence may have associations with mental health conditions such as\nanxiety and depression and it may be due to lack of volunteerism (Ojangole et al., 2023).

Specifically, the study explored the\ndifferent volunteering types that exist and the impact of volunteering in an agency on selfsatisfaction in Bukhalu sub-county, Bulambuli District. The study also investigated factors that\nhinder volunteering in an agency in Bukhalu sub-county, Bulambuli District. According to\nMugenda and Mugenda (2017) and Kumar (2019) interprets literature review as the systematic\nidentification, location and analysis of documents containing information related to the research\nproblem being investigated, which forms an integral part of the entire research process and makes\na valuable contribution to almost every operational step in the research. This chapter shows the\nvarious sources literature related to the topic of the research. The sources include; review of\nscholarly journals, government documents, text books, Internet and Newspapers. This Literature\nreview is done objective by objective. This chapter therefore shows and explains the review of\npast and actual literature studies which has been reviewed objective by objective. It included\ntheoretical review, empirical literature review and summary of identified gaps.\n2.1 Types of Volunteering that Exist\nAdams (2019) found that resource poor schools around the world rely on government support\nor on efforts from volunteers and private donations, in order to run effectively. In some countries,\nwhenever the economy is down, the need for volunteers and resources increases greatly. School\nsystems offer many volunteer opportunities with minimal requirements. Whether one is a high\nschool or TEFL (Teaching English as a Foreign Language) graduate or college student, most\nschools require just voluntary and selfless effort.\nAllen (2018) argued that much like the benefits of any type of volunteering there are great\nrewards for the volunteer, student, and school. In addition to intangible rewards, volunteers can\nadd relevant experience to their resumes. Volunteers who travel to assist may learn foreign culture", "word_count": 379, "start_char": 36970, "end_char": 39586}

Cultural and language exchange during\nteaching and other school activities can be the most essential learning experience for both students\nand volunteers (Allen, 2018).\nBenefacto, a volunteering brokerage, describe corporate volunteering as \"Companies giving their\nemployees an allowance of paid time off annually, which they use to volunteer at a charity of their\nchoice.\" A majority of the companies at the Fortune 500 allow their employees to volunteer during\nwork hours (Babchuk & Booth, 2018). These formalized Employee Volunteering Programs\n(EVPs), also called Employer Supported Volunteering (ESV) are regarded as a part of the\ncompanies' sustainability efforts and their social responsibility activities. About 40% of Fortune\n500 companies provide monetary donations, also known as volunteer grants, to nonprofits as a\nway to recognize employees who dedicate significant amounts of time to volunteering in the\ncommunity (Bowman, 2019).\nRelatedly, Bowman (2019) found that According to the information from Volunteer Match, a\nservice that provides Employee Volunteering Program solutions, the key drivers for companies\nthat produce and manage EVPs are building brand awareness and affinity, strengthening trust and\nloyalty among consumers, enhancing corporate image and reputation, improving employee\nretention, increasing employee productivity and loyalty, and providing an effective vehicle to\nreach strategic goals.\nCommunity volunteer work\nCommunity volunteering, in the US called \"community service\", refers globally to those who work\nto improve their local community. This activity commonly occurs through not for profit\norganizations, local governments and churches; but also encompasses ad-hoc or informal groups\nsuch as recreational sports teams (Bowman, 2019).", "word_count": 336, "start_char": 39296, "end_char": 41621}

The difference to other types of\nvolunteering is that there are strict legal regulations, what organisation is allowed to engage\nvolunteers and about the period a volunteer is allowed to work in a voluntary position. Due to that\nfact, the volunteer is getting a limited amount as a pocket money from the government.\nOrganizations having the biggest manpower in Europe are the Voluntary social year with more\nthan 50.000 volunteers per year, and the Federal volunteers service with about 30.000 to 40.000\nvolunteers per year (Bowman, 2019).\nVolunteering at major sporting events\nBabchuk & Booth (2018) argued that 1,000 volunteers worked at the 2014 Sochi Winter\nOlympics. They supported the organisers in more than 20 functional areas: meeting guests,\nassisting navigation, organising the opening and closing ceremonies, organising food outlets, etc.\nVolunteer applications were open to any nationals of Russia and other countries. The Sochi 2014\nOrganising Committee received about 200,000 applications, 8 applicants per place. Volunteers\nreceived training over the course of more than a year at 26 volunteer centres in 17 cities across\nRussia. The majority of participants were between 17 and 22 years old. At the same time, 3000\napplications were submitted from people over 55 years old. Some of them worked as volunteers\nduring the 1980 Olympics in Moscow. It was the first experience with such a large-scale volunteer\nprogram in the contemporary Russia (Bowman, 2019)\nMedical Volunteering\nA study by Allen (2018) found that volunteering in the context of delivering medical care is\nreferred to as medical volunteering. In general, medical volunteering has been lauded as a \"ethical\nresponsibility to aid the needy. The activities are often offered by both for profit and not for profit\nassociations. Medical volunteers typically participate in unpaid medical volunteer programs in\nhospitals, clinics, and underserved areas. Typically, these regions are in underdeveloped nations\nor nations battling natural disasters, sickness, or violence (Babchuk & Booth, 2018).).

Dental volunteering is a part of\nmedical volunteering which predominantly focused on dental care.\n2.2 The impact of volunteering in an agency on self-satisfaction\nVolunteerism is relevant for people of all ages as a source of social capital and goodwill and this\nhelps to enhance elf-satisfaction. In the context of most African countries, volunteerism is\nparticularly an important tool for promoting youth development. Research ILO (2020) shows that\nvolunteerism is an important pathway for enhancing youth employment and employability,\naddress. By volunteering, young professionals can sharpen their professional value propositions\nand problem-solving skills.\nKronauer (2021) recognizes two aspects of social integration i.e., interdependence and\nparticipation. The first refers to the integration into the process of the labour division and social\nnetworks; while the second refers to the material, cultural or political participation as well as other\nforms of social engagement (e.g. volunteering). Being a volunteer (i.e., the involvement in unpaid\nactivity to benefit other people) could play a key role in individual social integration, since it may\nbe an additional source of social recognition (Omara ET AL., 2017). This especially for individuals\nwith a chronic disability, who have to face numerous barriers when trying to enter the labour\nmarket and are often excluded. Active volunteering can offset the negative impact of other life\nconditions such as having long-term health problems or being unemployed\nCurrent economic literature on volunteering analyses the choices of people to participate in unpaid\nactivities in the framework of a consumption model of an intangible good or an investment model\nin human capital (ILO, 2018). Both models are ascribed to the orthodox economic tradition\naccording to which the agent is a ‘homo economicus’ driven in his choices only by a self-interest.\nThe consumption model presents the individual choice to dedicate oneself to volunteering as the\nintention to use his/her free time in the consumption of ‘activities’ (goods) that increase his/her\nimmediate well-being (intrinsic satisfaction). This choice is motivated by the search for private\ngoods such as prestige, reputation or a feeling of warm-glow produced by the act of giving\n(Andreoni, 2020). Stebbins (2017) reports various rewards from taking part in volunteer work,\nsuch as personal enrichment (by helping others), self-actualisation (developing skills and", "word_count": 422, "start_char": 43581, "end_char": 46477}
{"chunk_id": "DOC0110__00016", "doc_id": "DOC0110", "chunk_index": 16, "text": "his choice is motivated by the search for private\ngoods such as prestige, reputation or a feeling of warm-glow produced by the act of giving\n(Andreoni, 2020).S\n\ntebbins (2017) reports various rewards from taking part in volunteer work,\nsuch as personal enrichment (by helping others), self-actualisation (developing skills and\n\nknowledge), self-expression, self-image and self-gratification. The sense of satisfaction partly\nresults from these rewards (Stebbins, 2018). Andreoni (2017) has formally added the idea that\ngiving produces a pleasant sensation, called ‘warm-glow’. This is formulated as the donor's\npreference for giving in itself, distinct from the benefit enjoyed by the recipient.\nIn addition, empirical literature shows a positive effect of volunteer work on health outcomes, such\nas: self-rated health; improvement of physical and mental health; less likely to suffer from\ndepression (Okiria et al., 2021) Guidi et al. (2020) show the positive correlation between\nvolunteering and the enjoying of material and immaterial well-being in Italy. In the case of those\nwith a chronic disability, current literature mainly focuses on the effects of volunteering as a\npassive measure rather than as an unpaid work performed actively by these individuals to benefit\nothers.\n\nVolunteering is associated with better mental health in older adulthood (Baker et al., 2017).\nHelping behaviours generate better well‐being across culturally (Aknin et al., 2020). Previous\nstudies have consistently found that volunteering benefits life satisfaction, mental health, and well‐\nbeing in older adults. Socio-emotional selectivity theory has been used to explain this relationship.\n(Carstensen et al., 20219) proposes that people prioritise different goals throughout their lives. In\nparticular, people shift their focus from knowledge goals (e.g., learning a new skill) to emotional\ngoals (e.g., experiencing positive and meaningful emotions), as they view their future time horizon\nas increasingly shortened, such as in older adulthood. Initially, staying with close social partners\n(such as family members) and enjoying positive emotions were considered as “emotional goals”\nthat older adults pursue. Scheibe and Carstensen (2018) further clarified that the emotional goals\nprioritised by older adults are goals that are emotionally meaningful. In other words, an emotional\ngoal may be negative in some situations (Fung et al., 2016), and older adults may choose to stay\nwith strangers if they find that such activity can facilitate the achievement of emotional goals.\nBecause volunteering contributes to the needs and welfare of others, making it consistent with\nolder adults' emotional goals (Thoits, 2018), emotional goals are achieved when older adults help\nothers. Life satisfaction therefore increases after volunteering. In addition, volunteering is\nconsistent with the stage emphasising “generativity” in Erikson's psychosocial theory (1950).\nGenerativity refers to the willingness to take care of children and others. Volunteering is an activity", "word_count": 440, "start_char": 46151, "end_char": 49203}

Therefore, volunteering may be\nparticularly important for older adults to achieve the goal of generativity.\nMorrow‐Howell et al., (2017) argued that because volunteering could enlarge social network size,\nits effects would be more pronounced for people who have fewer social contacts than those who\nhave a large social network. People who have more social contacts might obtain sufficient\nresources from their existing social connections, and thus, the effects of volunteering would be\nless pronounced (Bowman, 2019). Volunteering is an approachable activity that people can easily\nparticipate in; thus, volunteering can be an efficient way to achieve emotional goals. In addition,\npeople with smaller social networks may have fewer social roles; therefore, the role of a volunteer\nmay be more important to these individuals than to those who have larger social networks and\nmore social roles (Adams, 2019). Therefore, the positive effects of volunteering may be more\nsalient in people who have smaller social networks.\nFurthermore, Oman, Thoresen, and McMahon (2018) found that volunteering was more protective\nin people who perceived a greater level of social support. Other studies found that older adults who\nhad more frequent contacts with friends and those who had close intimate relationships (Oman et\nal.,2020) had greater reductions in mortality risk after volunteering. In a younger adult sample,\nvolunteering was associated with fewer problem behaviours in a larger magnitude in the\nadolescents who received more support and instructions on coping with life challenges (Philliber,\nHerrling, & Kuperminc, 2020) than those who had less support and instructions. Oman and\nThoresen (2017) argued that older people could achieve the mutual goals of remaining active and\ngenerative by connecting with social partners. These goals were important for strengthening the\npositive effects of volunteering. Thus, people with more social connections or social support\nbenefitted more.\n2.3 Factors hindering volunteering\nBowman (2019) argued with regard to personality factors linked to volunteering, Binder and\nFreytag (2020) found a significant relationship between being open and extroverted and a greater\npredisposition towards doing volunteer work. In this case, 5000 British households were studied\nthrough 15,000 individual interviews, the sample consisting of people aged over 16.", "word_count": 397, "start_char": 48917, "end_char": 51650}

Psychological distance, understood\nas the perception that formal organizations are overly bureaucratic and complicated, has also been\nfound to be a hindering factor regardless of age. A bibliographical review carried out by Dávila de\nLeón and Díaz–Morales (2019) highlighted the following as factors that favor volunteering work\namong the older adults: a good economic level, a high level of education, good health, the belief\nthat they will improve and expand their social relations, and the perception of receiving social\nsupport when performing this type of work.\nThere are also a number of obstacles to older adults doing volunteer work. In the study conducted\non a sample of 735 people aged over 65 by Medina–Tornero and Carbonell–Cutillas (2018) 71.5%\nof the volunteers surveyed and 73.8% of the non-volunteers expressed agreement with the\nstatement “Older adults have time to volunteer, but there are almost no programmes or actions for\nthem to participate in” (2019). The study presented here explored the factors that facilitate and\nhinder social-health volunteering from the perspective of the older adults themselves. A mixed\nmethodology has been used, which to the best of our knowledge has not been done in other\ninvestigations.\n\nMorrow‐Howell et al., (2017) found that that volunteering is not an irrational act, and inquiry into\nthe philosophical, sociological, and psychological bases for decisions to undertake such work is\nneeded (Musick and Wilson, 2017). Work commitments are the most frequently cited reason for\nnot volunteering in England (The National Archives, 2020). Other reasons include childcare\ncommitments and looking after the home, doing other things, not knowing about volunteering\nopportunities, study commitments, looking after an elderly relative, disability, and age. Volunteer\nprevalence is not just an individual choice to volunteer or not but is also affected by what other\npeople are thinking and doing\nAdams (2019) argued that potential volunteers can be discouraged by formal recruitment\nprocedures such as completing a long registration form or attending an interview.

If you want HVC to assist in this please contact for more\ndetails. Organisations sometimes forget to develop different recruitment procedures for volunteers\nand staff. If you do use registration forms, only request information which is necessary. For\nexample, you might simply need to know that someone meets a minimum age limit for insurance\npurposes, rather than asking their exact date of birth. You might even decide not to use registration\nforms and note down the important details during an introductory chat with a new volunteer\n(Adams, 2019)\nPhilliber, Herrling, & Kuperminc, (2020) found that there are lots of different barriers that people\nmight face when looking for volunteering opportunities. The potential volunteer may have issues\nwith transport (like unreliable bus services and other means of transport being very expensive).\nSome people are sensitive to certain temperatures and might feel unable to come to their voluntary\nwork if it’s too hot or cold. Some need to take more time off than others so that they can keep\nappointments that are important for their well-being. People with certain disabilities may struggle\nin particular environments (but still want to work in that setting). People from different cultures\nmight need to take time off for religious events (and might not feel comfortable to wear certain\nclothes if there’s a uniform involved) (Adams, 2019)\n\nIn their other works, Philliber, Herrling, & Kuperminc, (2021) Some people may need to take\nbreaks at certain times so that they can take medication that’s important for their well-being and\nsome people may need a quiet space to relax for a bit (people who have Autism and experience\nsensory overload might need somewhere where they can chill out for a bit and “stim”). Some\npeople who have Tourette’s may have tic attacks where they need to be on their own for a bit (these\ncan be exhausting). People who have epilepsy may need someone to stay with them after a seizure\nand if able to be moved once they have come out of it, then it might be good to have a quiet place\nfor them to relax. People who have mental health issues may need somewhere to chill if things get\ntoo much for them and they need a break.", "word_count": 412, "start_char": 53926, "end_char": 56361}

Some people (no matter what their disability or background)\n\nmay want or need someone to support them until they feel comfortable in their voluntary role (like\na mentor).\nBowman (2019) found that nother very common reason is that people don’t have information about\nwhere to volunteer, or if they do, the jobs are not meaningful or purposeful. While motivation to\nvolunteer can vary by age, with younger volunteers more motivated by future preparation (such as\nincreasing skills, knowledge, and advancing careers) and older volunteers more likely to cite\ngenerativity as a reason for volunteering, most people are motivated to volunteer by personal\ngratification and having a meaningful experience. A solution would be for organizations who\nutilize volunteers to make sure they are matching the skills and experience of their volunteers to\nthe roles they have available. Making copies and coffee are certainly not meaningful to most. Some\norganizations have a short interview process where they discuss the background of the potential\nvolunteer to closely match it to the needs they have.\n2.4 Research gaps\nPast studies on volunteering have faced challenges like a lack of focus on specific groups,\ninconsistent measurement of volunteer performance, and a focus on organizational benefits rather\nthan individual experiences. Additionally, some research has struggled to adequately address the\ncomplexities of volunteer motivations and the impact of different types of volunteer opportunities.\nElaboration:\nMuch of the research on volunteering has been broad, failing to delve deeply into specific\ndemographics, types of volunteer activities, or the nuances of volunteer experiences. For\nexample, studies may not adequately address the unique challenges faced by community health\nvolunteers in diverse settings, or the impact of volunteering on individuals with specific needs\nor backgrounds.\n\nPerformance Measurement Issues:\nMany studies have struggled to develop reliable and valid measures of volunteer\nperformance.

In order to achieve the\ndesired outcomes of a non-biased study report, this chapter presents the methods that the researcher\nemployed while conducting the study. It show the research design, study population, sample size\nand selection, sampling techniques and procedures, data collection methods and techniques,\nvalidity and reliability of instruments, procedure of data collection, data analysis, variable\ndefinition and measurement and ethical considerations.\n3.2 Research Design\nA case study is a qualitative research design best suited for gaining an in-depth understanding of\na social phenomenon within its cultural context without imposing pre-existing expectations\n(Denzin & Lincoln, 2012). Gall et al. (2017) agree with this definition as they define a case study\nas an indepth study of instances of a phenomenon in its natural context and from the perspectives\nof the participants involved in the phenomenon and in educational research. Best and Kahn (2006)\nalso define a case study as a way of organizing social data for the purpose of viewing social reality.\nIt examines a social unit as a whole. The social unit may be a person, a family, a social group or a\ncommunity (Best & Kahn, 2016). Gall et al. (2017) propound that in a case study, a significant\namount of data are collected about the specific case selected to represent the phenomenon. The\njustification for the choice of a case study is that it was restrict the researcher to a small,\nmanageable group, where rigorous and thorough explorations were made to examine the\nphenomenon of raising children on urban streets (Best & Kahn, 2016).

New information in this case will be collected.\n3.4.2 Secondary sources\nThese are sources which are already gathered, processed and stored for the purpose. These sources\nprovided more knowledge to the researcher under the area of investigation. They include\ninformation from text books, records and respondents, information.\n3.5 Population and sampling techniques\nThe population of study means all items of inquiry which constitute a universe or population which\ndescribes the sample size that was used to collect data to support the study (Kothari 2005). The\npopulation of study comprised of 10 local leaders, 10 local people and 10 NGO staffs venders.\nLocal people are chosen to participate in this study because they understand the impact of\nvolunteering in an agency and its impact on self-satisfaction while local leaders are selected\nbecause their effort at formulating and implementation of labor policies. Additionally, NGO staffs\nwere chosen because they have relevant information regarding their involvement in addressing\nunemployment. The study population was drawn from Bukhalu sub-county, Bulambuli district\nThe total number of study participants (N) was 25 people and therefore the sample of 15\nparticipated in the study, that is to say; 05 local leaders, 05 local people and 05 NGO staffs using\nKrejcie and Morgan (1970) methods of determining sample size from the population (Sarmah &\nHazanka, 2012).\n\nTable 1.1 showing sample size and sampling technique\nCategory of population\nTarget\npopulation\nSample\nSampling technique\nLocal leaders\nLocal people\nNGO staffs\nTotal", "word_count": 324, "start_char": 61565, "end_char": 63688}

This study collected primary information through\nconducting structured interviews. According to Amin (2005), an interview is a structured and\nunstructured set of questions administered to interviewee(s). It is an oral administration of a\nquestionnaire and therefore it was a face-to-face encounter. The researcher used interview schedule\nto collect data from participants. Interview method was used because it helped to provide in-depth\ndata which is not possible to get using a questionnaire.\n1.9.2 Documentary Review\nThe researcher undertook Documentary reviews in research serve to analyze and interpret existing\ndocuments to gain insights, understand a phenomenon, or develop a narrative. This process\ninvolves examining various types of documents, such as historical records, official reports, or\npersonal accounts, to uncover patterns, themes, and contextual information. Documentary research\nis particularly valuable for social scientists, educators, and historian (Gall et al., 2007). Documents\ncan provide valuable insights into past events, social movements, and cultural trends, helping\nresearchers understand the present in relation to the pas (Best & Kahn, 2006:264). Purpose of\ndocumentary research is to gather verifiable evidence, that can help researchers understand clearly\nevents that occurred in the past/present and also uncover new knowledge by analyzing existing\ndocuments and materials (Thorndike & Hagen, 2000). In this study, the researcher review\ndocuments such as arrival books, recruitment minutes,, voluntary staff lists and application\nforms/letters\n3.10 Quality control\n3.10.1 Validity\nThe validity of an instrument is defined as the ability of an instrument to measure what it is\nintended to measure. Validity considers how correctly the research tools measure what the\nresearcher wants to measure. Thus, validity is about the research tool being credible or trustworthy\nor being accurate or correct (Etyang, 2018).After formulating the questionnaire, the supervisors\nand other experts reviewed the items and checked the language clarity, content", "word_count": 382, "start_char": 64458, "end_char": 67144}

To establish the validity of\nthe instruments, the researcher used expert judgement as recommended by Gay (1997) as the best\nmethod for ensuring validity. Thus the researcher ensured that the instrument is clear, relevant,\nspecific and logically arranged. The validity of the interview guide was tested using the content\nvalidity test (CVI). To arrive at the relevancy of the questionnaire, the researcher designed the\ninstrument that yielded content –valid data by first specifying the domain of indictors that are\nrelevant to the concept being measured. A content-valid data measure contained all possible items\nthat measure the impact of volunteering in an agency and its impact on self-satisfaction\n3.10.2 Reliability\nA tool’s reliability shows the extent to which it is free of errors and for that makes sure that there\nis continuous valuation across time and also across the various items in the instrument. This\ntherefore means that a tool’s reliability shows how stably and consistently the tool evaluates the\nidea thereby helping to measure the worthiness of a measure (Sekaran & Bougie, 2019). The\nresearcher employed the test-retest reliability. According to Sekaran and Bougie(2019), the\nreliability of the instrument is tested using the test re-test method of reliability and Cron-bach alpha\ntests to determine the reliability index with the help of SPSS. Data was collected from 10 people\nnot among those in the sample. The principle of reliability as far as research instruments are\nconcerned, is clearly put forward by Amin (2019), an instrument is reliable if it produces the same\nresults wherever it is repeatedly used to measure a trait or a concept from the same population and\nunder similar circumstances.\n3.11 Data Processing and Analysis\nData analysis is the process of methodically applying logical techniques to describe and illustrate,\nsummarize and recap, and evaluate data (Shamoo & Resnik, 2003). The task is to make sense of\nmassive amounts of data, reduce the volume of information, identify significant patterns and\nconstruct an outline communicating the essence of what the data reveal (Best & Kahn, 2006).\n3.14 Ethical considerations\nThe following ethical considerations were looked at by the researcher during the research.", "word_count": 410, "start_char": 66799, "end_char": 69471}

Informed consent is the\nbasis of ethical research (Denzin & Lincoln, 2019). The people participating in the study were\nmade aware of what the study is about, it’s purpose, usage of the data, and any consequences that\ncould arise from it (Fleming, 2018). The researcher furnished the respondents with information on\nthe reason for the research and the procedure of collecting data. The participants were allowed\nenough time to ask questions and have any concerns addressed. The respondents exercised free\nwill in deciding whether to participate in research activity or not. All people to be involved in the\nresearch was given consent form to express their acceptance to participate in the study.\n3.14.2 Confidentiality: Confidentiality is looked at by Walford(2018) to mean information that is\nprivate andis not to be divulged to others. Whatever has been said in confidence must remain\nconfidential. The researcher assured participants that information offered by the respondent was\nnot to be passed on to another party (third party) without consent of the respondent. Their identity\nand response were made confidential and anonymized through the use of numbers or through\npseudonyms.\n3.14.3 Anonymity: Anonymity, termed more appropriately as pseudonymity, is defined by Wiles\n(2013) as a major meansused by the researcher to safeguard the confidentiality of responders by\nusing pseudonyms.Anonymisation is one of the kinds of confidentiality, comprising of identity\nconcealment of research responders (Saunders, Kitzinger, & Kitzinger, 2015). The researcher\nensured that all respondents are anonymous implying that their identities are not known and not\nsalient in the study. Withholding the identity of respondents is a guarantees that their statements\nare authentic (Taylor, 2015).\n3.14.4 Plagiarism: The researcher ensured that all written work was original and without any\nborrowed and manipulated texts, results or even expressions. The researcher made sure that, all\nwords and publications of the author are given their due acknowledgement (Mugenda & Mugenda,\n2019). The researcher subjected the written works to the turn it in software and make sure it is\n15% or less compliant of plagiarism material.", "word_count": 411, "start_char": 69140, "end_char": 71851}

This may be due to the fact that some respondents\nmay be hesitant to give information. However, this was solved through having a dialogue with\nrespondents and explaining clearly the purpose of the study.\nThe problem of limited time, many respondents had no enough time to respond adequately to the\nquestions while attending to their busy schedules.\nIn adequate finances, the researcher had little funds to move to and fro the field and more so buying\nthe necessary requirements used in the study. However, friends and relatives were requested to\ncontribute to solve the situation.\n2.5 Conclusion\nThis chapter has presented the research methodology that ere employed. Qualitative research\ndesign to present data that was collected from 15 participants identified through simple random\nsampling. Validity and reliability was used to ascertain the credibility of research tools and a\nnumber of ethical issues such as confidentiality, Anonymity, and plagiarism was adhered to during\ndata collected. This methodology was crucial in fulfilling the study objectives.\n2.6 Chapter Summary\nThis study used a qualitative research approach in exploring the impact of volunteering in an\nagency and its impact on self-satisfaction in Bukhalu sub-county, Bulambuli District. This\nqualitative approach entailed presenting and analyzing data collected through interviews through\nlogical techniques to describe and illustrate, summarize and recap, and evaluate data. The aim of\nthis mythology is to enable the attainment of non-biased findings of the study and this enabled the\nreplication of research findings.\n\nCHAPTER FOUR\nDATA PRESENTATION AND INTERPRETATION\n4.1 Introduction\nvolunteering in an agency in Bukhalu sub-county, Bulambuli District. The study used qualitative\nresearch approach and a case study design of 15 participants who included local leaders, social\nworkers and persons with alcohol addiction were interviewed. Data was collected from participants\nusing interview method. This chapter presents the findings of the study and it is divided into two\nparts. Part one presents demographic characteristics of participants and part two (2) is the\ninterpretations of the findings.\n4.2 Demographic characteristics of participants\nTable 4.1 showing demographic information of participants\nS/No\nPseudo Name\nAge\nEducational level\nGender\nS3\nMale\nS4\nMale\nLocal leader four (LL4)\nS6\nMale\nLocal leader four (LL4)\nS5\nS3\nMale\nS4\nP4\nS3\nMale\nS3\nMale\nMale\nMale\nMale", "word_count": 425, "start_char": 71581, "end_char": 74381}

The difference in the age was an important component of selecting respondents for the\nstudy, which helped in obtaining different information and also shows maturity in the collected\ninformation. In this regard, the selected and interviewed participants were from 18-25, 26-33 and\n34 above. Here, the purpose was to find out the average age of participants in the study and it was\ndiscovered that majority of the participants (10) were in the age bracket of 34 and above. The\n\nabove view indicated that participant’s added value to the responses given that mature participants\nare more trustable as they take time to think about a particular aspect of life before giving reliable\nresponses.\nGender of participants\nAccording to the findings of the findings of the study, Nine (09) participants were males and\nfemales were Six (6). This implies that the male participants were the majority hence most of the\ndata was collected from male participants.\nEducational level of participants\nData showed that majority of the participants (09) had acquired secondary education. This meant\nthat they easily understood questions in the interview guide and their views were well informed.\nUma (2017) asserted that it is important in social investigation research to involve people that have\nattained an acceptable level of literacy and numeracy in order to be in position to understand and\ninterpret contents of the interviews.\nFor purposes of anonymity, the following codes were used:\nLL = local leader 1-5\nLP = local people 1-5\nNGO staffs = Staffs from NGO 1-5\n4.2.1 THEME I: Types of Volunteering that Exist\nStudy participants were asked to mention the various types of volunteering that exist and their\nresponses were: Volunteering in schools, corporate volunteering, community volunteer work and\nwelfare volunteering", "word_count": 345, "start_char": 74381, "end_char": 76600}
