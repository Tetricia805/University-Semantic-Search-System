(Kim & Shin, 2022)\n1.1 Background of the study.\nThe media is essential in influencing public opinion, encouraging openness, and keeping the\npowerful accountable. However, there are several obstacles for media professionals in Uganda,\nsuch as intimidation and violence. Print, broadcast, and online media are all present in Uganda,\nand journalists there cover a vast range of topics, from social and economic concerns to politics\nand government. Notwithstanding this crucial role, media workers in Uganda frequently deal\nwith intimidation, assault, and harassment while doing their jobs.(Nyarko & Akpojivi, 2017)\nThis research proposal aimed to delve into the perceptions of journalism students regarding the\nexposure to violence encountered by media professionals in Uganda, shedding light on the\nattitudes, concerns, and expectations of the next generation of journalists in the country. The\nlife of a journalist has become dangerous in many parts of the world(Ross, 1999), it has been\nregistered by many organizations and reported about by different agencies in Uganda, majorly\nthe Human Rights Network for journalist in Uganda advocates for the rights of journalists who\nexperience violence cases while performing their task and duties.(International & Report,\n2014)\nWhen journalist are attacked, they are not only beaten but their equipment’s like voice\nrecorders, video cameras, still photos cameras are destroyed alongside in order to get rid of the\nevidence especially while recording the police or the army beating people during elections or\npeaceful protects in Uganda and Africa as well.(Nyarko & Akpojivi, 2017)In their quest of\nremoving the footages from camera, most cameras are confiscated or destroyed in order to get\nrid of the evidence. (Le Cam et al., 2021)\nLately, Irene Abalo Otto, a former journalist, spended her days lying in bed, resting her injured\nfoot, which has had a profound impact on her life. She was at the pinnacle of her journalism\ncareer, working for the prominent Nation Media Group in Uganda when a fateful afternoon in\nFebruary 2021 changed everything. She was Sent to cover a press conference, which ended up\nbeing attacked, resulting in a severe leg injury that continues to cause her pain.

The physical and\nemotional trauma from that incident forced her to abandon both her job and her studies.(When\nAttacked on the Job, Many Journalists Stay Silent, n.d.)\nThe range of grievances reported included physical assault, unlawful arrest and detention,\ninterference with radio stations, seizure and destruction of equipment, restrictions on access,\nand cyberattacks. The report underscored a concerning trend, indicating that a significant\nportion of these assaults occurred in the context of elections and political campaigns,\nhighlighting the vulnerability of journalists during crucial democratic process.(Ozawa et al.,\n2023)\nPhysical assaults frequently take place against journalists while they are out in the field\ncovering stories for their respective media organizations. Additionally, other forms of violence,\nsuch as cyberattacks, are directed at journalists at various stages, including during the course\nof their work. It is evident that individuals who perpetrate these acts of violence against\njournalists in Uganda often include members of the police force and military personnel. This\nsituation has significantly eroded and had a detrimental impact on the working environment\nfor journalists.(Kim & Shin, 2022). On this ground the research will seek at understanding how\njournalism students basically in Uganda Christian University perceive this type of violence\nIt has been recorded that female journalist experience large number of violence especially if\nthey are reporting from the war zone areas mainly sexual violence.Sexual violence is mostly\nused to silence and intimidate women journalists, and adds that women are additionally\nexposed to attacks because their work challenges gender stereotypes.(Høiby, 2016).\nUnderstanding this form of violence is key for both male and female journalist therefore this\nwork will focus at assessing the level of awareness and understanding among journalism\nstudents about the various forms of violence, including physical, and online threats, and\nattacks.(Kim & Shin, 2022)\nWhile a substantial number of attacks against journalists often remain undisclosed, the Human\nRights Network for Journalists — Uganda, a nonprofit organization established in 2005 to\nchampion the rights of journalists, has provided compelling statistics. In 2021, they\ndocumented 131 cases involving human rights violations and mistreatment of journalists and\nmedia professionals. Notably, during the height of the pandemic in 2020, these figures were\neven higher, with 174 cases reported. Furthermore, in 2019, an additional 165 cases were\nbrought to attention.(When Attacked on the Job, Many Journalists Stay Silent, n.d.)", "word_count": 452, "start_char": 18244, "end_char": 21311}

The freedom of media is seen in the Article 29(1).\n‘Every person shall have the right to freedom of speech and expression, which shall include\nfreedom of the press and other media”(Kimumwe. P, 2014) and the right to seek receive and\naccess information, which is the core of a free media, is also provided for in article 41, which\nstates that; “Every citizen has a right of access to information in the possession of the State or\nany other organ. (Kimumwe. P, 2014) but this has risen question like to what extent are media\npractitioners free during their work time.\n1.2 Problem Statement.\nThe exposure to violence encountered by media professionals in the course of their duties is an\nescalating concern in developing countries, with incidents of physical assaults, verbal threats,\nand attacks becoming increasingly prevalent.(Nyarko & Akpojivi, 2017) This issue raises\nquestions about the safety, mental well-being, and overall job satisfaction of journalists.(Le\nCam et al., 2021) Understanding the perceptions of journalism students regarding this violence\nis crucial, as their future careers will likely entail similar risks.(Groves et al., 2016)However,\nthere is a gap in knowledge regarding how journalism students perceive and prepare for the\nchallenges associated with violence in the field.(Kim & Shin, 2022)\n1.3 Purpose of the study.\nThe purpose of the study is to examine how journalism students perceive and interpret the\nviolence media practitioners under go through.\nResearch Questions and Hypothesis.\n1.4 Objectives\nTo explore the perception of journalism students towards pursuing a career in journalism,\nconsidering the potential risks of exposure to violence\nTo assess the level of awareness and understanding among journalism students about the\nvarious forms of violence, including physical, and online threats, and attacks.", "word_count": 399, "start_char": 20941, "end_char": 23526}

Through an analysis of these students'\nviewpoints, this research provides insightful information on the unique difficulties experienced\nby media professionals in Uganda. It also clarifies how the next generation of journalists might\nhandle and overcome these difficulties.\n1.6.3 Time Scope\nThis research study will take place between July 2023 and May 2034. This long time span\nmakes it possible to provide a thorough analysis of Uganda Christian University journalism\nstudents' attitudes and views of media violence in Uganda.\n1.7 Justification\nAny democracy must have a free and unrestricted press because it gives the people essential\ninformation and acts as a check on authority. This freedom is directly threatened by media\nviolence against journalists, so it's critical to comprehend how upcoming journalists will see\nand handle these difficulties. The results of this study will highlight the extent to which press\nfreedom is in jeopardy and offer insightful information to advocates and legislators who fight\nto preserve democratic norms.\nThe views of journalism students will influence the media landscape going forward, as they\nrepresent the next generation of media professionals. We are able to better prepare students for\nthe realities of their profession by looking at their perspectives on violence against journalists.\nThis research can help shape curriculum modifications that incorporate safety training, ethical\ninstruction, and a strong sense of professionalism and social responsibility in journalism\neducation. This, in turn, ensures that these future journalists are well-equipped to report\nethically, even in challenging circumstances.\nThis research's advocacy and awareness component is equally essential. Students studying\njournalism are frequently at the vanguard of social and political movements, lending their\nvoices to effect change. Gaining an understanding of their perspectives on violence against\njournalists can result in campaigns for advocacy, increased awareness, and cries for justice.\nThis study could serve as a catalyst for constructive change, encouraging society to uphold\npress freedom and confront the problems that jeopardize it. It supports the larger endeavor to\npreserve a strong, independent media and preserve the democratic principles that rely on it in\nthis way.", "word_count": 402, "start_char": 25151, "end_char": 27922}

These students will influence the direction, ethics, and values of the media industry\nas future professionals in the field. Knowing their opinions on this matter helps them advocate\nfor press freedom, maintain media ethics, and be ready to cover potentially hazardous\noccurrences.\nThrough examining their viewpoints, we can acquire significant understanding of the changing\nobstacles encountered by journalists and modify journalism training, media establishments,\nand regulations to more effectively tackle these issues. In the end, this study is an important\nstep toward preserving democracy, press freedom, and the ethical standards of journalism. The\nknowledge gathered from this study has the potential to significantly alter journalism's ethics,\nvalues, and practices, which will have a long-term effect on the media's place in society.\n1.9 Theoretical framework\n1.9.1 Cultivation theory\nCultivation theory, developed by George Gerbner in the 1960s, is a communication theory that\nexplores the long-term effects of television on viewers' perceptions of the social world. The\ntheory suggests that prolonged exposure to television content, especially in the portrayal of\ncertain themes and messages, can shape and cultivate viewers' attitudes and beliefs about the\nreal world(Shrum, 2017)\nReferring to the research, this theory will help in understand how journalism students interpret\nthis violence when they watch them on television and what are basically their reactions.\n1.9.2 Agenda-setting theory\nProposed by Maxwell McCombs and Donald Shaw in the 1960s, agenda-setting theory argues\nthat the media has the power to shape the public agenda by highlighting certain issues, which\nthen influences the public's perception of what's important(Zain, 2009). The theory is grounded\nin the idea of salience—what stands out becomes significant in our minds.\nUnderstanding how the media shape people perception is very key in this study therefore I will\ndelve into understanding the perception created by the media especially on the student’s\nstudying journalism", "word_count": 365, "start_char": 27631, "end_char": 30119}

In the context of media violence, Cognitive\nDissonance Theory can be applied to understand how individuals reconcile their awareness of\nviolent media portrayals with their own beliefs and values, especially when it comes to\njournalism(J. Cooper, 2012).\n1.9.4 Social Learning Theory:\nAlbert Bandura's Social Learning Theory offers a framework for comprehending how people\npick up violent attitudes, behaviours, and norms through modelling, imitation, and observation\nin the context of media violence(E.Grusec, 1992). This theory will help in digesting how the\njournalism students relate their behaviours to what they learn and watch on television\nconcerning the media violence.\n1.9.5 Perception theory:\nPerception theory explores how individuals select, organize, and interpret information from\ntheir surroundings. It's like a mental filter that shapes our understanding of reality. Our\nperceptions are influenced by our past experiences, cultural background, personal beliefs, and\ncognitive biases(Gordon, 2004).\nIn the context of communication, perception theory is crucial because it helps us understand\nhow people process and make sense of messages. What one person perceives from a message\nmight differ significantly from another, leading to diverse interpretations(R. Cooper, 2014).\nUnderstanding perception is vital for gathering information concerning media violence and\nhow it affects the students of journalism in general.

In the landscape of contemporary journalism, media violence against\njournalists stands as a formidable challenge, undermining press freedom and democratic\ndiscourse in various regions across the globe(Benítez, 2017) The perpetration of violence\nagainst journalists takes many forms, ranging from physical attacks and verbal abuse to online\nharassment.(Harlow et al., 2022)\nThese acts not only hinder the journalists' ability to fulfil their vital roles as purveyors of\ninformation but also cast a chilling effect on the broader media environment.(Anderson et al.,\n2015) While media brutality affects journalists universally, it is paramount to understand how\ndifferent segments of society, particularly journalism students, perceive and respond to this\nphenomenon(Ozawa et al., 2023)\nExamining how journalism students view media violence against journalists in Uganda is\nimportant because it can provide insight into how journalism education, press freedom, and\nmedia resilience are changing in the country. Like many other countries, Uganda has struggled\nwith media violence issues that have far-reaching effects on the journalism profession as well\nas the larger democratic landscape(When Attacked on the Job, Many Journalists Stay Silent,\nn.d.)This study aims to clarify the complex relationship between education, career goals, and\nthe realities of media violence by focusing on the perspectives of journalism\nstudents.(International & Report, 2014)This approach offers a distinctive perspective on the\ncomplex difficulties that Uganda's future generation of journalists must overcome.\n2.1 Media landscape in Uganda.\nThe early history of mass media in Uganda is marked by the influence of missionaries who\nplayed a pivotal role in its establishment in the early twentieth century. These early forms of\nmedia primarily took the shape of religious newsletters However, it was not until 1912 that\nUganda saw the emergence of its first commercial newspaper, the \"Uganda Herald,\" which was\npublished in English and targeted mainly at a European audience (Crystallography, 2016)\nThe media landscape in Uganda has always been closely intertwined with the country's political\nstructure(M. B. Chibita, 2010). This highlight that the media in Ugandaoperated in an\nalignment to the pollical structure set in place by different pollical players or system in Uganda.\nUganda faced civil conflicts during President Milton Obote's rule in the 1960s and 1980s and", "word_count": 435, "start_char": 31650, "end_char": 34693}

Chibita & Fourie, 2007).\nDespite enduring decades of political and economic, Uganda has witnessed progress over the\nlast 25 years under President Yoweri Museveni(M. B. Chibita, 2010)When Museveni assumed\nthe presidency in 1986, he promised a free press, leading to a surge in the number of media\noutlets and greater journalistic freedom(Tangri & Mwenda, 2010)Vary many media begrun\nnewspapers began reporting on corruption scandals involving government officials (Tripp\n2004). The 1990s saw media liberalization, and in 1995, the Constitution of the Republic of\nUganda enshrined freedom of expression as a fundamental right.\nToday, Uganda's media landscape is home to three English-language dailies, with the\ngovernment-owned \"The New Vision\" having the highest circulation, approximately 30,000\ncopies per day, followed by the independent paper \"The Monitor\" with a circulation of around\n26,000 (Goretti 2007). Weekly papers such as \"The East African,\" \"The Weekly Observer,\"\nand \"Sunrise\" coexist alongside \"around a dozen TV networks, most of them privately-owned,\"\nstate-run radio, and more than 200 private radio stations (BBC 2017, para. 1). \"Radio Uganda,\"\nthe public radio station, broadcasts in 28 languages (Chibita 2009) and holds a substantial\nadvantage as it covers the entire country, unlike FM stations that have limited broadcast ranges.\nWith government support and funding, \"Radio Uganda\" can gather news from across the\nnation, particularly through Information Officers stationed in various regions (Goretti 2007, 4).\nDespite the constitutional guarantee of free speech and the proliferation of media outlets, the\ngovernment continues to impose restrictions on journalists. Journalists have been detained, and\nmedia houses have been temporarily shut down by the government. Reporters and editors face\ncharges of libel, sedition, treason, defamation, and other vaguely-worded laws when they\nbecome too critical of the ruling party (Mwesige 2004; Kalyango and Eckler 2010). Those not\nformally charged frequently experience threats, intimidation, and violence from government\nofficials (Reporters without Borders 2020). These pressures have led to increased selfcensorship among journalists (Dicklitch and Lwanga 2003; Kalyango and Eckler 2010).\nBeyond government interference, several other factors have hindered Uganda's media industry\nsince its inception, including limited foreign investment, inadequate formal journalism\ntraining, and scarce resources (Isoba 1980). Insufficient training has resulted in unprofessional\nbehaviour, such as accepting bribes. Additionally, journalists are poorly compensated, which\ncan lead to media content being geared toward the interests of advertisers rather than the \"public\ninterest\" (Goretti 2009, 121–122).", "word_count": 450, "start_char": 34426, "end_char": 37597}
{"chunk_id": "DOC0072__00013", "doc_id": "DOC0072", "chunk_index": 13, "text": "nsufficient training has resulted in unprofessional\nbehaviour, such as accepting bribes.A\n\ndditionally, journalists are poorly compensated, which\ncan lead to media content being geared toward the interests of advertisers rather than the \"public\ninterest\" (Goretti 2009, 121–122).\n\nDespite these challenges, Ugandan journalists are said to be going through a process of\n\"journalistic domestication,\" which involves overcoming growing pains and ultimately\nestablishing their own journalistic norms and professional practices (Sobel Cohen and\nMcIntyre 2020, 666). Freedom House (2017) has described Uganda as having \"one of the more\nvibrant media scenes in east and central Africa\" (para. 5-6), and noted that \"Museveni has\nreceived international praise for cultivating a 'relatively liberal media climate'\" (Tabaire 2007,\n204). However, it's important to note that much of the discussion about the \"liberal\" media\nenvironment in Uganda refers to the presence of numerous private media organizations in the\ncountry, rather than journalists' ability to report freely. Critics argue that Uganda, as a semiauthoritarian state, implements just enough democratic policies to appear democratic and\nappease international donors, while ultimately aiming to maintain power.\n\n2.2 Media Violence Against Journalists in Uganda.\nIn Uganda, violence against journalists has grown to be a serious problem that needs to be\naddressed. Journalism have been greatly impacted by the long-standing and urgent problem of\nmedia violence against journalists(Le Cam et al., 2021). Investigating delicate subjects,\ncovering political campaigns, or covering events frequently exposes journalists to various\nforms of violence and targets them(Wilson, 2012). A variety of actors, such as security services\nand political figures and their allies, may launch these attacks.\nAccording to Irene Abalo Otto, a former journalist, sustained a serious leg injury during a press\nconference when she was attacked by a military police officer. This incident forced her to give\nup her journalism career.(When Attacked on the Job, Many Journalists Stay Silent,\nn.d.)Unfortunately, such attacks often go unreported due to a lack of confidence in the justice\nsystem\nThe article cites data from the Human Rights Network for Journalists — Uganda, which\nreported numerous cases of human rights violations and abuses against journalists in the\ncountry, with a significant increase during election periods. These abuses include assault,\nunlawful arrest, equipment damage, censorship, and cyberattacks.\nJournalists, in the line of duty, face various forms of intimidation and violence from different\nquarters, including security forces, politicians, and their supporters. Many journalists,\nintimidated by their attackers and disillusioned by the lack of justice, either leave the profession\nor choose safer careers to avoid harm.", "word_count": 412, "start_char": 37318, "end_char": 40194}

In response, some journalists have united to fight\nagainst the offenders collectively, achieving positive outcomes in some cases.\nThe article also underlines the lasting physical and psychological impact on journalists who\nhave been victims of such violence. Irene Abalo Otto, for example, now works from home and\nmisses the fieldwork she once enjoyed. The pervasive media violence in Uganda is an issue\nthat jeopardizes the safety and freedom of journalists and is a significant concern for press\nfreedom in the country.\nJoshua Mutale was documenting a demonstration by women opposing an increase in police\nbrutality when the incident occurred. Armed with a recording device in one hand and a set of\nearphones in the other, Mutale was focused on capturing the voices and stories of these women,\na task fundamental to his role as a journalist. Little did he anticipate the sudden and shocking\nturn of events that would unfold before him(Nyarko & Akpojivi, 2017)\nAs he was immersed in his work, a policeman, hardly identifiable, suddenly appeared on the\nscene. In a startling and unprovoked act, this officer unleashed pepper spray directly into\nMutale's eyes using a hand spray. The painful and disorienting effects of the pepper spray\nincapacitated Mutale, causing him to fall to the ground. Fortunately, his fellow journalists who\nwere present rushed to his aid, helping him cope with the effects of the attack(Nyarko &\nAkpojivi, 2017)\nIn 2020, at least Ten journalist were beaten by military police when they were covering the\nopposition leader Robert Kyagulanyi, known as 'Bobi Wine,' as he delivered a petition to the\nUnited Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Kampala. His petition\nwas a protest against human rights abuses and abductions of his supporters surrounding the\ncontested presidential election.\nDuring the period of elections, journalist often suffer in the hands of police while doing their\nwork and during the eve of 2016 general elections where the government employed a lot of\ncrime preventers who could act under the ideal of protecting crimes in Uganda(Royal &\nSociety, 2023). These were the police who were causing chaos to journalist are were even\narrested and put under charges for no good reason.\n2.3Types of Violence Against Journalists:\nJournalists in Uganda, like their counterparts in many parts of the world, face a multitude of\nchallenges and forms of violence in the course of their work(Ozawa et al., 2023). These\nchallenges encompass physical violence, verbal abuse, online harassment, sexual harassment,", "word_count": 487, "start_char": 39772, "end_char": 42896}
{"chunk_id": "DOC0072__00015", "doc_id": "DOC0072", "chunk_index": 15, "text": "hese\nchallenges encompass physical violence, verbal abuse, online harassment, sexual harassment,\n\nand censorship(Høiby, 2016). This research delves into these segments to shed light on the\ncomplex and sometimes hard environment in which journalists operate in Uganda.\n2.3.1 Physical Violence:\nThe use of force or other physical acts intended to harm or injure another person is referred to\nas \"physical violence\" (Krantz & Garcia-Moreno, 2005). One of the most evident and alarming\nforms of assault against journalists in Uganda is physical violence. Journalists often find\nthemselves in the middle of heated circumstances, like political rallies, protests, and conflict\nzones. In these settings, they are the targets of physical attacks from several angles. (Jackson\n& Ashley, 2005)\nFor instance, during the preparations for the 2021 elections in Uganda, there have been\ncomplaints of security personnel physically beating journalists covering opposition\ndemonstrations. Moses Bwayo was detained, beaten, and sent in police jail in November 2020\nwhile he was photographing opposition leader Robert Kyagulanyi's arrival at his party's office.\nBwayo's career was shattered. Similarly, journalist Ashraf Kasirye was shot by the police in\nDecember while covering a Kyagulanyi demonstration and sustained injuries. This physical\nviolence can take many different forms, including beatings, shootings, and even the\ndeployment of tear gas or rubber bullets. These tragedies serve as a reminder to journalists of\nthe dangers associated with covering politically controversial events.\n2.3.2 Verbal Abuse:\nJournalists are abused both physically and verbally in Uganda. Many persons, including\nmembers of the public, politicians, and government officials, may be the source of this. Anxiety\nand intimidation of journalists is a typical objective of verbal abuse, which promotes a culture\nof fear and self-censorship.\nThe police chief, Martin Okoth Ochola, intimidated individuals during a press conference in\nJanuary 2021, shortly before the elections. Declaring quite frankly that \"we shall beat you\njournalists for your own sake.\" Such remarks not only encourage an environment of impunity\nbut also create a hostile environment for journalists who are merely carrying out their duties.\nThis increases the level of insecurities within the working arena of journalism because they\nfeel as if they are not protected by the law since Martin Ochola who is the chief in command\nof the police therefore this affect journalist while performing their work(Ek et al., 2013)\n2.3.3 Online Harassment:\nJournalists in Uganda, like those across the globe, are subjected to cyberbullying, hate speech,\nand harassment on social media platforms and other online spaces because of their reporting or", "word_count": 410, "start_char": 42800, "end_char": 45571}

The survey had over 900 validated\nparticipants from 125 countries, and the findings primarily focus on the responses of the 714\nwomen-identifying participants(Posetti et al., 2020).\nThe report aligns with the UN Secretary General's statement that women journalists,\nparticularly those covering topics like politics, law, economics, women's rights, gender, and\nfeminism, are more likely to be targets of online violence(Posetti et al., 2020). The key impacts\nmentioned are the disproportionate severity of online violence against women journalists and\nthe correlation between certain subject areas and the frequency of attacks\nOnline abuse comprises spreading false information about the journalist, threatening messages,\nand hate speech. It not only negatively impacts the mental health of journalists but can also\nhave real-world repercussions like physical attacks or legal harassment Legal\nHarassment(Walulya & Selnes, 2023)\n2.3.4 Presss Censorship:\nPress censorship is the practice of restricting, managing, or preventing the media from\ndisseminating information, frequently carried out by governments or other authorities. Both\nstate and non-state actors have the ability to impose censorship, which can take many different\nforms.(Cain, 2014)\nThe state and non-state actors have the ability to censor content, which can restrict media and\nfreedom of speech. Suppressive measures used by governments to restrict media freedom\ninclude punitive laws, threats, sanctions, and physical authority. These measures are\ncollectively referred to as state censorship(Cain, 2014)\nIn Uganda, critical media outlets run the risk of closure, license suspensions, and sanctions.\nThe government frequently uses security forces to apprehend journalists who refuse to comply.\nGovernments can also employ strategies such as hacking media websites, obstructing news\nsites, surveilling journalists electronically and online, and limiting or prohibiting internet\naccess to impose state censorship on contemporary media(Cohen & Mcintyre, 2020).\nAccording to (Waisbord, 2020) on mob censorship, which is a form of bottom-up non-physical\nviolence perpetrated by unaffiliated individuals or groups, often in the context of online\nharassment of journalists. Mob censorship can involve attacks, trolling, abuse, and harassment\nof journalists, particularly on social media platforms. Unlike state and market censorship,", "word_count": 378, "start_char": 45571, "end_char": 48278}

In order to essentially silence media\noutlets, authorities may also revoke their licenses or shut them down. Threats against media\nowners or financial pressure in the form of advertising boycotts can occasionally be used to\ncontrol media content. (Cohen & Mcintyre, 2020).\n2.4 Implications and Consequences:\nThere are important ramifications to the many sorts of assault and harassment Ugandan\njournalists face. They primarily jeopardize press freedom and the media's watchdog function\nin society. When journalists are subjected to violence and harassment, their ability to hold\npeople in positions of authority accountable is jeopardized. (Cohen & Mcintyre, 2020).\nJournalists are forced to self-censor due to the atmosphere of fear created by these violent and\nharassing acts. Because they fear for their safety, they could refrain from reporting on particular\nsubjects or occurrences, which reduces the breadth and depth of news reporting. (Waisbord,\n2020)\nThese actions also weaken public confidence in the media. When journalists are targeted and\nsilenced, the public's access to accurate and diverse information is curtailed, leading to a\ndecline in trust in media outlets and journalism as a profession(Cain, 2014).\n\n2.5. Journalism Education in Uganda:\nJournalism is a field of work and a profession that involves collecting, reporting, and analyzing\nnews and information to inform the public. Journalists, also known as reporters or\nnewsmen/women, play a crucial role in providing the public with accurate and timely\ninformation about current events, issues, and developments in society. Here are some key\naspects of journalism(Zelizer, 2005)\nIn Uganda, for you be considered as a professional journalist you needed to having studied\njournalism at diploma level or degree in any of the renowned institution in Uganda like Uganda\nChristian University, Makerere University, and other renown university in Uganda or outside\nUganda.

This could affect\ntheir ability to use theoretical information in real-world situations.\n2.6.2 Limited Resources:\nMany journalism programs in Uganda might not have as much funding as they could have,\nfor example, if they don't have access to contemporary technology, media production\nequipment, or library resources. This might have an impact on the training and experience\nstudents receive in the actual world.\n2.6.3 Safety Concerns:\nEnsuring the safety of journalism students studying sensitive themes like political instability\nor corruption is a big challenge when it comes to investigative reporting.\n2.6.4 Digital Transformation:\nJournalism is evolving along with digital technology. New technologies, internet journalistic\nmethods, and social media reporting may be challenging for students to become used to.\nKeeping up with the rapid changes in the media industry requires constant learning.\n2.6.5 Limited Networking Opportunities:\nEstablishing professional networks is crucial for students studying journalism. However, a lack\nof industry contacts and networking opportunities may make it difficult for them to break into\nthe workforce.\n2.6.7 Media Regulation and Freedom of the Press:\nThe Ugandan press freedom and regulatory framework may have an impact on journalism\nstudents. Striking a balance between open reporting and following legal requirements can be\nchallenging.\n2.7 Perception of Media Violence:\nIn common terminology, perception is defined by Longman Dictionary of Contemporary\nEnglish as “a) the way you think about something and your idea of what it is like; b) the way\nthat you notice things with your senses of sight, hearing etc.; c) the natural ability to understand\nor notice things quickly.”1 In philosophy, psychology, and cognitive science, perception is the\nprocess of attaining awareness or understanding of sensory information.

Subsequent investigations may explore the reasons\nbehind these assaults and the trends they adhere to. Targeted interventions can be informed by\nknowledge of the underlying causes and recurring themes in attacks on media\npractitioners.(Nyarko & Akpojivi, 2017)\n\nWhen attacked while performing their duties, many journalists stay silent because they fear to\nspread the information and their lives from the people who are always after them. This has\ngreatly contributed to the increments in the concept of media violence(When Attacked on the\nJob, Many Journalists Stay Silent, n.d.)\n\nWhile researching about the online attacks on journalist, some of the attacks include comments\nthat denigrate women's bodies and discredit journalists' reportage, it doesn't delve deeply into\nthe specific forms and tactics of online harassment.
