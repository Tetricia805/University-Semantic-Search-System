This research was focused on the\nuse of soursop pulp as a natural sweetener in total replacement of refined sugar\nduring yogurt production and also use of lime juice as a natural flavorant. Three\nbatches were prepared and three treatments randomly assigned for each batch. To\nbatch 1, soursop pulp containing 2% lime juice was added to the yogurt(T1), to batch\n2, only soursop pulp was added to the yogurt (0% lime juice) which acted as the\ncontrol and to the third batch, 3% lime juice was added to the yogurt. Chemical\nqualities of the yogurt such as fat, carbohydrate, protein, fibre and Vitamin C\ncontent of the soursop pulp- lime yogurt was determined and they were compared\nagainst the same nutritional attributes of conventional strawberry fruit yogurt. A\none sample t test was carried out to compare the results. The results revealed that\nsignificant differences (p<0.001) in protein, fat, total carbohydrate, total fibre and\nvitamin C content between the soursop pulp-lime yogurt and strawberry fruit yogurt\nused for comparison. The soursop pulp-lime yogurt exhibited slightly higher protein,\nfat and fibre content. There was significant decrease in the carbohydrate content\nand increase in the Vitamin C content as well. Consumer acceptability testing was\nalso carried out and the results revealed that colour scores were highest for 3% lime\njuice, aroma scores were highest for 2% lime juice and consistency scores highest in\n3% lime juice. Mouthfeel scores decreased slightly with an increase in lime juice.\nThe overall taste was rated highest for 2% lime juice.\n\nii\n\nDECLARATION", "word_count": 401, "start_char": 0, "end_char": 2528}

INTRODUCTION\n1.1 Background of study\nFermented drinks and food, particularly yogurt, have been largely consumed over\ncenturies due to their flavor and nutritional benefits, such as high protein content,\ntreatment of lactose intolerance. They are rich in minerals such as calcium, which\nis essential in bone structure, and potassium (Katia Sivieri et al, 2017)\nYogurt is one of the most popular dairy products globally, with major consumers in\ncountries such as France, the United States of America, China, the Netherlands,\nTurkey, and India. China, for example, has an average per capita consumption of\nabout 5kg per consumer annually. The yogurt market is particularly big in North\nAmerica and Europe. According to World Integrated Trade Solution (WITS) data for\n2023, Germany led exports with about $780.5 million, followed by the European\nUnion collectively at $523.4 million, Greece at $351.4 million, France at $348.7\nmillion, and Spain at $170.6 million (World Integrated Trade Solution, 2023).\nYogurt is made using specific bacteria known as yogurt cultures, which are primarily\nLactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus. Strains such as\nLactobacillus delbrueckii and Streptococcus salivarius can be added to improve the\nprobiotic content of the yogurt. Probiotics are harmless, live and active\nmicroorganisms ingested to alter the gastrointestinal flora for health benefits. These\nferment lactose to lactic acid, giving yogurt its texture and tang. Yogurt is\nconsidered a probiotic product offering several health benefits, such as improved\nlactose digestion, but also easy digestion in general since it's easier for the body to\nabsorb its nutrients, offers strengthening of the immune system, and reduces risks\nof type 2 diabetes and gut disorders (Nahed L Zaki et al, 2021). Yogurt is rich in highquality proteins, carbohydrates, calcium, phosphorus, potassium, and vitamins B6\nand B12. Various yogurt types include plain, Greek, frozen, fruit, and flavoredsweetened yogurt. However, over the past decade, studies have shown that\nconsumer preferences for food products have shifted from taste and flavor as the\nmain drive towards nutrient content, natural additives and sweeteners, and", "word_count": 407, "start_char": 15049, "end_char": 17903}

This trend shows that consumers have become more health\nconscious. Soursop fruit, Annona muricata, which is known for its sweetness (Makebe\nCalister Wingang, 2021), and lime (Citrus aurantifolia), valued for its tanginess, are\npotential natural alternatives for sweetening and flavoring yogurt. Furthermore,\nsoursop has high nutritional content while lime, is also a rich source of vitamin C\nand other antioxidants that are essential in the elimination of free radicals from the\nhuman body (Kamelia Ramadaini et al, 2020). Both fruits are currently underutilized\nin the country due to a lack of knowledge of their nutritional and economic benefits.\nPrevious studies have shown that soursop puree or pulp, when added to yogurt,\nimproved on the functional, sensory, and nutritional properties of yogurt (Senadeera\net al, 2018) and also contributed to an increase in vitamin C content of the yogurt\n(Saputrayadi et al,2021). Further studies have also shown that the soursop puree or\npulp was added to yogurt during its manufacture, mainly to improve the flavor of\nthe yogurt. Soursop pulp was also added in partial substitution of refined sugars such\nas sucrose. (Mayowa Saheed Sanusi et al, 2023). Lime has been added to fruit juices\nin previous studies to improve the microbial quality of the fruit juices to increase\ntheir shelf life due to its anti-microbial and anti-oxidant properties. (Micheal\nOkpara, 2013). However, there is limited information on the use of soursop pulp as\na sweetener in full substitution of refined sugar during yogurt manufacture, and no\nsubstantial studies have been carried out on the use of lime juice as a flavorant in\nyogurt. There is also a need to further explore the interactive effect of lime juice\nand soursop pulp on the nutrient composition and consumer acceptability of yogurt.\nThe above information will highlight the potential of soursop pulp as a natural\nsweetener and lime juice as a natural and unique flavorant in yogurt, and therefore\ncontribute to the development of healthier dairy products that align with the\nchanging consumer preferences. The findings of this research will also provide\nvaluable insights for food manufacturers seeking natural alternatives to refined\nsugars and innovative flavor profiles.", "word_count": 425, "start_char": 17492, "end_char": 20266}

Soursop fruit (Annona muricata), a tropical fruit known for its natural\nsweetness and rich nutrient content, offers potential as a substitute for refined\nsugar in yogurt production. However, its complete substitution for refined sugar\nremains underexplored, particularly regarding its ability to maintain sweetness\nlevels while providing additional health benefits without compromising the\nfermentation process or sensory attributes of yogurt.\nSimilarly, lime juice, a natural flavorant with a good consumer appeal due its antibacterial, anti-oxidant and tangy properties, poses challenges in yogurt\nmanufacturing due to its high acidic nature which risks curdling and formation of a\nbitter taste that affect product consistency and taste. Consequently, the feasibility\nof its use as a flavorant in yogurt remains unknown.\n1.3 Purpose of the study\nThis research aims to address these gaps by determining the feasibility of using\nsoursop as a full replacement for refined sugar in yogurt production and assessing\nlime juice as a natural flavorant without compromising yogurt texture, stability, and\ntaste. This study seeks to develop innovative yogurt formulations that cater for\nhealth-conscious consumers, increasing utilization of soursop fruit and lime in the\nfood and beverage industry through yogurt production; while ensuring maintenance\nof sensory attributes and product integrity during storage.\n1.4 Objectives of the study\n1.4.1 Main objective\nTo produce a sugar-free yogurt by fully substituting refined sugar with soursop pulp\nas a natural sweetener and incorporating lime juice as a natural flavorant, while\nassessing their combined impact on the nutritional, sensory, and physicochemical\nproperties of the yogurt.", "word_count": 312, "start_char": 20100, "end_char": 22273}

The use of soursop pulp and lime juice as natural substitutes\nfor refined sugar and artificial flavourings provided yogurt and non-sweetened\nyogurt consumers due to health concerns a healthier alternative which was sugarfree yogurt of similar taste as that of sweetened yogurt but with a unique flavor\nprofile.

The first key component of this research was\nthe determination of vitamin C, protein, carbohydrate, fat and fibre content of the\nproduced soursop-lime yogurt. This was followed by comparing it with the\ncomposition of the same nutrient attributes of conventional fruit yogurt. The\npurpose of this exercise was to demonstrate nutritional advantages or otherwise,\nsince conventional fruit yogurt has almost similar nutritional properties like those of\nsoursop pulp-lime yogurt especially in aspects of vitamin C and fibre as opposed to\nordinary sweetened yogurt. Furthermore, the study assessed the consumer\nacceptability of soursop pulp yogurt without lime juice and soursop pulp yogurt to\nwhich different concentrations of lime had been added through sensory evaluation\nusing an untrained panel to gauge overall yogurt preference of the consumers.\n1.9 Limitations of the study\nThe use of a fixed 1:1 replacement ratio of the soursop for sugar may not identify\nthe optimal concentration for sweetness, flavor and overall quality of the yogurt.\nVarying concentrations could potentially yield better sensory and nutritional results.\nThe comprehensive nutrient analysis will be carried on only one soursop pulp-lime\nyogurt treatment which leaves gaps in drawing definitive conclusions on the nutrient\ncontent of the other treatments that will be made. The absence of a shelf-life study\nmakes it difficult to assess the long-term stability of the sensory attributes and\nmicrobial quality and therefore safety of the soursop pulp-lime yogurt.

It is scientifically defined as a metabolic\nprocess that produces energy from organic compounds with or without the\ninvolvement of exogenous agents such as microbial enzymes or microorganisms.\nFor a very long time, fermented drinks and foods contributed greatly to the human\ndiet in terms of their nutritional health benefits, and Yogurt has emerged as one of\nthe most consumed dairy fermented product on the market today (Andrzej\nBlazejczyk,2023). It has one of the fastest growing markets with France, Turkey,\nNetherlands, United States and China being some of the world’s biggest consumers\n(C. Chandan, 2024, A. Shunekeyeva, M. Alimardanova et al., 2021) The largest\nconsumer is China with an average consumption of about 5kgs per person per year.\nGeographically, North America is the major contributor to the yogurt market in\nterms of value followed by Europe and this has been due to introduction of new\nflavors that offer low fat benefits. In the Asian Pacific region, China dominates the\nmarket followed by India with Japan showing continuous steady growth in the past\nyears.\nThe total export value of yogurt around the world in 2015 was more than 2 million\nUS dollars with about 1.5 million tons of yogurt being exported around the world.\nGermany has been the leading exporter of yogurt for many years with a trade value\nof more than 500,000 US dollars and 500,000 tons in 2015 which accounts for more\nthan 30% of the yogurt traded globally. (IDF, 2016). The bacteria used to make yogurt\nare known as yogurt cultures and these cultures include Lactobacillus delbrueckii\nsubspecies bulgaricus and Streptococcus salivarius subspecies thermophilus\naccording to the CODEX standards (CODEX STAN 243-2003). In addition, others\nlike Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria are also sometimes added during or after\nculturing the yogurt. Fermentation of lactose by these bacteria produces lactic acid,\nwhich acts on milk protein to give yogurt its texture and characteristic tang. It is a\nprobiotic product since it contains live active microorganisms which upon ingestion\n\nin sufficient number exert health benefits beyond the inherent basic nutrition\n(CODEX STAN 243-2003). This benefit has increased the consumption of yogurt.", "word_count": 431, "start_char": 26334, "end_char": 29083}

It is also an excellent source of carbohydrates, which are a source of\nenergy to the body. It is also important in the prevention of type 2 diabetes due to\nits probiotic content, which improves insulin sensitivity (Koichiro Sumi et al).\nYogurt is also crucial in weight management, for it creates satiety, which reduces\novereating. Probiotics in yogurt enhance gut health by improving digestion and\nalleviating conditions like irritable bowel syndrome and lactose intolerance by\nbreaking down the lactose. Yogurt helps to reduce cardio metabolic diseases by\nlowering serum cholesterol levels. It is also rich in calcium, vitamin D, which support\nbone density and reduce the risk of osteoporosis (Christopher J Cifelli et al, 2020).\nThe probiotics in the yogurt have immune-modulatory effects that boost the body’s\ndefense mechanism. Yogurt also controls infections by inhibiting the growth of\npathogenic organisms. Yogurt’s nutrients contribute to healthier skin by improving\nhydration and reducing inflammation and bloating (Julie M Glanville et al, 2015).\nThe popular varieties of yogurt include;", "word_count": 265, "start_char": 28691, "end_char": 30438}

It generally consists of 390 species in\nthe tropical and subtropical areas world-wide (Pinto et al, 2017). A. Muricata is\nclassified as shown below;\nKingdom; Plantae\nDivision; Magnoliophyta (Angiosperms)\nClass; Magnolids\nOrder; Magnoliales\nFamily; Annonaceae\nGenus; Annona\n\nSpecies; muricata\nThe soursop fruit is a fused-together berry that is dark green in colour with a spiky\nor spiney surface (Patel and Patel, 2016) and associated flower parts. It is a heart\nor oval-shaped fruit with about 5-200 seeds. (Blancke, 2016). The average weight of\na healthy soursop fruit is about 4kg, and it has a creamy coloured granular interior\nwith an edible, fibrous and juicy fleshy pulp which can easily be peeled away from\nits core. The soursop fruits can be categorized into: acid, subacid, and sweet, or can\nbe grouped according to how their flesh is, i.e., wet, soft, stiff, and extremely dry\n(Matsuda,2017)\nSoursop fruit, botanically known as Annona muricata, locally known as “Ekitaferi”\nin Uganda, is a delicious fruit widely grown in the tropics and subtropical regions of\nthe world, including South America, Africa, and Asia, with the largest being Mexico.", "word_count": 441, "start_char": 30070, "end_char": 32918}

(Uchegbu et al, 2018). The white edible pulp contains 1% protein, 18%\ncarbohydrate, 3.43% titratable acidity, 80-81% water, 24.5% non-reducing sugar, and\nvitamins B1, B2, and C. Furthermore, soursop is made up o 53.1-61.3 calories, 82.8g\nmoisture, 1 g protein, 0.97g of fat, 60 g of ash, 10.3mg of calcium, 0.79g of fibre\nwhich makes up 0.78-0.95% of the pulp (Gavamukyala et al, 2017), 0.64mg of iron,\n0.11mg thiamine, 29.6mg of vitamin C, 11mg tryptophan, methionine (7mg), 60g\nlysine, sugars account between 67.2-69.9% of the total solids.

(Princess Hannah,\n2023)\n\n2.5 Post-harvest challenges and proper handling of soursop.\nPreliminary analyses have indicated a substantial loss of 75.8% for tropical fruits like\nsoursop. This loss is accelerated by poor field farmer practices and growers’ lack of\nknowledge and understanding of factors affecting fruit quality. In Uganda, soursop\nhas low production due to its low demand and high pre-harvest and post-harvest\nlosses caused by the fruit borer, leading to 30% loss and 54% total pulp yield\n(Kankwatsa et al., 2017). This has led to scattered production by only willing\nindividual farmers in the country. Soursop fruits are usually harvested when they\nare fully developed and still a bit firm and yellow-green (physiological maturity)\n(Badrie & Schauss, 2010) or else they will fall and be crushed if allowed to\ndeteriorate on the tree. Ripe soursop fruits are highly delicate and prone to bruising\nwhich shortens their post-harvest life and that is why ripening at room temperature\nis recommended as young fruits do not fully develop aroma and flavor when ripened\noff the tree. Soursop fruits are highly sensitive to cold temperatures with chilling\ninjuries causing skin darkening, inability to ripen, pulp discoloration, poor flavor and\naroma and increased rot (de Lima and Alves, 2011).\nTo prevent spoilage and reduce deterioration of soursop fruit, the soursop fruit is\npulp and the pulp pasteurized at 790C for 69 seconds to preserve nutrients,\ninactivate spoilage enzymes and reduce microbial load and is then refrigerated at\ntemperatures between 40C (Jerry Ampofo-Asiama et al., 2018) to increase its shelf\nlife from 5 days to 12 weeks. One of the other significant challenges faced with\nsoursop fruit is that it has a short harvest season and so cultivators that have various\nmaturity durations have been created in effort to balance the market supply (Badrie\n& Schauss, 2010) and has low production majorly due to its very low demand and\nhigh pre-harvest and post-harvest losses due to its perishability.

(Badrie & Schauss 2010).\nSoursop fruit currently is mainly consumed as a fruit, juice or packed purees\nworldwide. Previous research in the last decade has shown that soursop fruit is rich\nin flavours especially in sweetening flavours i.e., rich in sugars, has a high nutritional\nprofile i.e., contains vitamins, minerals, proteins, flavonoids, phenolic compounds\nwith\nantidiabetic,\nantihypertensive,\nanticarcinogenic,\nantiobesity,\nantihypercholesterolemic, hypoglycemic and antibacterial properties. In addition,\nthe pulp is rich in soluble fibres especially hydrolysed pectin (pectin oligosaccharides\nthat are prebiotics and therefore are a source of food to probiotics in the gut\nespecially the colon and maintain its health. (Mbaeyi-Nwaoha, Ekere K.S) It also has\na high protein content and has been used in countries like Nigeria and Benin to treat\nprotein deficiencies. (Rene G Degnon et al). Previous studies have shown that\nsoursop puree or pulp, when added to yogurt, improved the functional, sensory, and\nnutritional properties of yogurt (Senadeera et al, 2018) and also contributed to an\nincrease in vitamin C content of the yogurt (Saputrayadi et al,2021). Further studies\nhave also shown that the soursop puree or pulp was added to yogurt during its\nmanufacture, mainly to improve the flavor of the yogurt in addition to refined sugar\nsuch as sucrose or in partial substitution of refined sugars with the soursop pulp.\n(Mayowa Saheed Sanusi et al, 2023).\n2.6 Overview of lime fruit\nLime is a fruit botanically known as Citrus aurantifolia and locally known as “Enimu”\nis a citrus fruit known for its tangy-bitter taste, which is a common attribute of the\ncitrus family of fruits. It is also known as orange pecel. Lime trees can reach 3-6\nmeters high, are branched and thorny with small oval leaves that have a winged\npetiole. The axillary leaves are where an inflorescence emerges to give small white\nfragrant flowers. The fruit is ovate or round-shaped and it has a green-yellow colour\nwith thin skin that is rich in essential oils. The inside flesh of the fruit is greenish\nwhite and is rich in vitamin C, with many small and polyembryonic. They grow well\nin alkaline soils; places exposed to direct sunlight. Propagation of the fruit is by seed\nor grafting. The fruit is used to make drinks, cough medicine, and food flavoring.\n(Zikra Azizal., 2020) It is rich in phytochemical compounds such as alkaloids,\n\nflavonoids (apigenin, rutin, quercetin, kaempferol, hesperidin), triterpenoids,\nsaponins, tannins, phenolics, and vitamin C.

(Kamelia Ramadaini et al., 2020)\n\nFigure 3 A picture of lime fruit\n2.7 Nutritional benefits of lime fruit\nLime’s health benefits are mainly due to its phytochemical compounds. These health\nbenefits include: (Kamelia Ramadaini et al., 2020)\nLime has anticarcinogenic effects where it stops the mobility of cancer cells, inhibits\nmetastasis and angiogenesis, and induces tumor suppressor genes and apoptosis.\nLime peel extract has been used to help heal traumatic ulcers due to its antiinflammatory properties and also inhibits bacterial growth and therefore is\ncommonly used as a preservative.\nLime peel extract can help heal traumatic ulcers due to its anti-inflammatory\nproperties.\nLime also aids in digestion due its acidity that provides an ideal environment for the\naction of stomach enzymes like pepsin, gastric amylase and lipase. (W. Abobatta et\nal, 2019).\nThe tangy taste from lime is important to balance the sweetness of the yogurt\ncreating a uniform and balance flavor. (Rati Jani et al, 2024).\n2.8 Changes in consumer preferences for food products\nThe factors driving consumer acceptability of food products are undergoing\nsignificant changes. Historically, taste and flavor were primary considerations, but\nrecent trends indicate a shift towards nutritional benefits, the use of natural\nadditives and natural sweeteners, particularly moving away from refined sugar.\nConsumers increasingly prefer products with fewer synthetic chemicals and more\n\nnatural ingredients such as stevia, which is a natural, intense sweetener used in\nvarious food categories like snacks and beverages (Jovana Dzoljic et al., 2018).\nThis shift is driven by health concerns such as obesity and chronic diseases linked to\nhigh sugar intake (N. Caglarirmak et al., 2021). Additionally, innovations in food\ntechnology like the development of functional gummy candies with natural\nsweeteners and antioxidants reflect this consumer preference for healthier options\n(Mohammad Tarahi et al.,2024).

This indicated a\ngenerally positive consumer acceptance across all sensory attributes. Colour\nreceived one of the highest ratings (approximately 6.5), suggesting consumers found\nthe visual appearance of the soursop yogurt particularly appealing.\nTangy Taste received the lowest rating (approximately 5.5), though it was still a\npositive. This was most likely due to the strong taste from the soursop, as mentioned\nby some panelists. This might indicate that while consumers generally accepted the\ntaste profile, the specific tanginess of the soursop yogurt could potentially be\nadjusted to better meet consumer preferences. Consistency, Aroma, Overall Taste,\nMouthfeel, and Overall Acceptability all scored similarly (approximately 6.0),\ndemonstrating balanced sensory characteristics.\nThe Overall Acceptability score (approximately 6.0) aligns with the average of most\nother attributes, suggesting that in general, the acceptability of the yogurt was\nslightly above the average score and therefore the yogurt was slightly good.\n\n4.2.2 TABLE 2\nThe p-value is less than 0.001 for protein, total fat, total carbohydrate, total fibre,\nand vitamin C. This indicated that there is a significant difference in the protein,\ntotal fat, total carbohydrate, total fibre, and vitamin C content of the soursop pulplime yogurt (3%) and that of the strawberry fruit yogurt.

In\naddition, the fat content in the soursop pulp-lime yogurt was 0.19g higher (slightly\nhigher) than that of the strawberry fruit yogurt because soursop, being a fruit,\nnaturally contains traces of natural oils (Nguyen T.T et al, 2020). The total\ncarbohydrate content was 9g less than that of the strawberry fruit yogurt, indicating\na reduction in sugars. The total fibre content in the soursop pulp-lime yogurt was\nslightly higher than that of strawberry fruit yogurt.

The specific objectives\nincluded determining the vitamin C, protein, carbohydrate, fat, and fibre content\nof the soursop pulp-lime yogurt compared to conventional fruit yogurt, and\nevaluating the consumer acceptability of the developed yogurt.\nThe physicochemical analysis revealed significant differences (p < 0.001) in protein,\ntotal fat, total carbohydrate, total fibre, and vitamin C content between the soursop\npulp-lime yogurt and a strawberry fruit yogurt used for comparison. The soursop\npulp-lime yogurt exhibited slightly higher protein and fat content, which can be\nattributed to the natural composition of soursop. Notably, the carbohydrate content\nwas significantly lower, indicating a reduction in sugars due to the substitution of\nrefined sugar with soursop pulp. The fibre content in soursop pulp-lime yogurt was\nslightly higher than that in conventional strawberry fruit yogurt and this suggested\nthat soursop contains a higher quantity of fibre than strawberry fruit. In addition,\nthe vitamin C content was also higher in the soursop pulp-lime yogurt, which can be\nattributed to the inherent Vitamin C content of soursop and lime.\nThe sensory evaluation of the yogurt with varying concentrations of lime juice (0%,\n2%, and 3%) showed variations in sensory attributes. Colour scores were highest for\nthe 3% lime juice treatment, suggesting enhanced visual appeal, but the differences\nwere not statistically significant. Aroma scores were slightly improved with the 2%\nlime juice, but again, the differences were not significant. The consistency improved\nwith increasing lime juice concentration, although the effect was minimal. The\ntangy taste was highest with the 2% lime juice, but decreased with 3%, possibly\nbecause higher lime juice concentration overpowered the tangy taste from the\nsoursop pulp. The consistency scores increased consistently across all treatments\nprobably due to the fact that acidity leads breakdown of proteins and fibre forming\na smoother consistency. The overall taste was rated highest for the 2% lime juice,\nsuggesting that moderate addition enhanced the flavor profile, while the 3%\nconcentration had a negative impact. The mouthfeel had a slight and consistent", "word_count": 425, "start_char": 66697, "end_char": 69572}

The results\nshowed there was no significant difference in the consumer acceptability of soursop\npulp yogurt and soursop pulp-lime yogurt and hence we do not reject the hypothesis.\nOverall, the study demonstrated that soursop pulp can effectively replace refined\nsugar in yogurt production, resulting in a product with comparable or improved\nnutritional properties. The addition of lime juice at a 2% concentration enhanced\nthe sensory attributes and overall acceptability of the yogurt.\nSoursop pulp-lime yogurt has a distinct nutritional profile compared to conventional\nstrawberry fruit yogurt. It is slightly higher in protein and fat (due to the natural\ncomposition of soursop), significantly lower in carbohydrates (due to sugar\nsubstitution), and higher in fibre and vitamin C (due to soursop and lime). This yogurt\noffers a potentially healthier alternative with reduced sugar content and increased\nmicronutrients.\nThe addition of lime juice at a 2% concentration (T2) improved the sensory attributes\nand overall acceptability of soursop pulp yogurt. While colour and consistency\nimprovements were observed with a 3% concentration (T3), the tangy taste became\nless appealing, negatively impacting the overall taste and acceptability.

CRD can help\nto minimize variability and provide more robust statistical analysis.\nFurther research should focus on optimizing the amount of soursop pulp used to\nensure better sweetness and overall taste. Varying the concentration of soursop pulp\nand conducting sensory evaluations can help determine the optimal level that\nprovides adequate sweetness without compromising other sensory attributes.\nGiven that aroma scores were relatively lower for all treatments, future research\ncould explore the addition of natural aromas like maple syrup for a natural caramel\ncolour and aroma or different varieties of lime to boost the aroma.\nSince mouthfeel also received moderate scores, more maxigel could be added to the\nyogurt to improve the texture and mouthfeel.\nFurther research can be carried out on the use of other citrus fruits, such as lemon\njuice or orange, which could offer better sensory attributes than lime juice.\nFurther studies can also be done on the microbial quality of the yogurt to determine\nits shelf life and stability of sensory attributes for a given period of time.", "word_count": 240, "start_char": 71302, "end_char": 72872}
