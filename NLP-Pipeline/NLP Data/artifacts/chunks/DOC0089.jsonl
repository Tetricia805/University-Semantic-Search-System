It examines the Constitutional and statutory provisions\ngoverning bail application in the High Court of Uganda, focusing on how the High\nCourt has practically applied the law when determining bail applications and the\nimpact of their decisions on the principle of bail application in the High Court. The\nresearch explores the balance between the accused’s right to bail and the safety or\nsecurity of society. The legal framework grants the High Court broad discretion,\nwhich it has used in determining the bail application for capital offenses, and in\nturn, affected the effectiveness of the legal framework on bail application in the\nHigh Court of Uganda. Other factors also affect the effectiveness of the legal\nframework in determining bail applications in the High Court of Uganda, and these\nare the non-legal factors as discussed in the research.\n\n1 | P a g e\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n1.0 Introduction\nBail is the recognizance entered into by the accused himself conditioning him to appear\nfor trial, failure of which may result into the forfeiture of the recognizance. Recognizance\nis either the amount of money or property deposited by the accused in return for their\ntemporary release from custody. In the case of Lawrence Luzinda v Uganda1, Justice\nOkello defined bail as the agreement between the court, the accused and sureties on the\nother hand that the accused will attend his trial when summoned to do so. Benjamin Odoki\nthe Chief Justice of Uganda in his book defines bail as an agreement or recognizance\nbetween the court and the accused (as well as any sureties, if any).2\nThe right to bail is a fundamental right premised on the presumption of innocence.3 In\nUganda v Kiiza Besiye4, court stated that the refusal to grant bail should not be based on\nmere allegations and bail should not be refused merely as a punishment as it would conflict\nwith the presumption of innocence. Thus, in connection with bail application in the High\nCourt, an applicant kept under custody without trial for over 180 days, has a right to apply\nto be released on bail since they are innocent and not yet proven guilty.\nThe High Court of Uganda handles bail applications for capital offenses differently from\nother offenses by applying stricter legal standards, more formal procedures and heightened\njudicial scrutiny to balance the gravity of the offense with the constitutional rights of the\naccused and public safety. This is because capital offenses are considered to be graver\noffenses compared to other offenses and releasing an accused on bail yet charged for a", "word_count": 444, "start_char": 11589, "end_char": 14259}

This formal process ensures detailed\ngrounds and evidence to be considered for grant or denial of bail. Bail for capital offenses\nis either discretionary or mandatory. Mandatory bail is where the accused has been held\non remand for over 180 days without trial while discretionary bail is bail determined by\nthe court not relying on specific laws.\nThe High Court of Uganda has the discretion to either grant or deny a bail application. 5\nCourt is not bound by specific legal mandates. In Foundation for Human Rights Initiative\nv Attorney General6, Justice Mwangusya Eldad held that the right to bail under Article\n23(6)(a) is not an automatic right. The Judge weighs factors on a case-by-case basis and\nwhile exercising its discretion, court must act reasonably in the process. In Gilbert\nBaalibaseka Bukenya v Uganda7, the anti-corruption court judge Justice Mugamba deemed\na recognizance of 50 million shillings as reasonable due to the gravity of the corruption\noffences that led to the loss of billions of public funds. In Charles Onyango Obbo and\nAndrew Mwenda v Uganda8, the high court interfered with the discretion of the lower\ncourt, that had imposed a cash bail of UGX 2000000 to each of the accused. It held that\nthe lower court did not act reasonably.\nFrom the above cases, the court exercised its discretion basing on reasonableness. Still the\nunguided and unlimited discretion is prone to uncertainties, uneven denial or grant of bail.\n\n5 Article 23(6)(a) of the 1995 Constitution of Uganda (as amended)\n6 (constitutional Appeal No. 3 of 2009) [2018] UGSC 46 (26 October 2018)\n7 HC (Anti-Corruption Division).

Justice Sebutinde in Dr. Martin Kato Mugamba and Anor\nv Uganda9 stated that, “The constitution allows the state a grace period of 360 days now\n180 days as amended with which it can lawfully detain an accused person pending\ncommittal for trial and during which period the state is expected to complete its\ninvestigations and commence prosecution of the accused persons.” However, it is not a\nguarantee that an accused spending over 180 days in custody without trial is guaranteed\nbail. If the severity suggests a high risk to public order or if releasing the accused will\nendanger the society, bail will be denied. In Kizito v Uganda10, the High Court reiterated\nthat bail decisions in capital offenses must carefully consider public safety risks alongside\nthe accused’s rights, emphasizing the courts discretion to deny bail where the risk of harm\nor interference is substantial. In Bidongo Zenone and two others v Uganda11 where the\napplicants were denied bail on grounds that due to the severity of the offense (murder),\ngranting the applicants bail would amount to exposure of the applicants to the danger of\nmob justice by the relatives of the deceased and the society. Thus, even under mandatory\nbail, the need for a reasonable decision to be made by the High Court in the consideration\nfor bail application is so important both to for public safety and protection of the rights of\nthe accused.\nCapital offenses are offenses triable only by the High court with a punishment of either\ndeath or imprisonment for life. Examples of such offenses are terrorism, under the Anti-\nTerrorism Act 2002, Cattle rustling contrary to section 266 of the Penal Code Act, Offenses\nunder the Firearms Act punishable by more than 10 years’ imprisonment.

Of the\n889 criminal cases, 706 were concluded within the 12 months’ stipulation and 180 cases\ntook from one year to as long as 22 years to conclude. The causes of the delays were\ndelayed investigations due to lack of information during trial, failure by key witnesses to\nshow up on appointed dates of trial and the large case load of judges.13 Chief Justice\nBenjamin Odoki in the Makerere University Law Journal14 noted that,” The delay in\nJustice is the enemy of justice and criminal justice in particular and it is Justice Denied.”\nAll these delays mean the accused will be kept in custody on remand for periods that\nwarrant release on bail.\n\n12Magistrate’s Courts Act Cap 16 section 75(2)\n13 Report of the Auditor General on the Judiciary for the year ended December 2024 page 11\n14 The Delayed Justice page 32\n\n5 | P a g e", "word_count": 396, "start_char": 18445, "end_char": 20846}

The rate of criminal case disposal\nwas at 43.34%15. A case is considered backlog if it has spent two or more years in the court\nsystem before it is disposed of or completed. Case backlog significantly impacts bail\napplications in several ways, like, delayed hearings lead to prolonged detention without\ntrial. When an accused is kept in custody for very long periods without trial and then\napplies for release on bail, court is most likely to deny the accused bail on ground that\nthey are desperate to be released and are most likely to abscond trial when granted bail.\nIn conclusion, this research sought to identify the effectiveness of the current legal\nframework on bail application in the High Court of Uganda with focus on clarifying\nambiguous provisions, standardizing interpretations and tightening bail requirements\nwhere necessary for very serious crimes so as to tame the increase in the commission of\ncapital offenses in Uganda.\n1.1 Background\nDuring the colonial period, bail was introduced through the reception clause of the 1902\nOrder in Council. Article 15(2) empowered the Commissioner to apply any law from the\nUnited Kingdom and any other protectorate of the United Kingdom in Uganda with\nmodification. These laws were applied verbatim. After Uganda gained independence in\n1962, the country’s laws continued to evolve. The rights of prisoners to be released, if not,\nbe brought to court without undue delay was provided for in the 1962 Uganda constitution.\nHowever, the bail system remained largely restrictive due to reasons which were largely\npolitical and procedural. Article 19(3) of the 1962 constitution provided that any person\n\n15 Judicial Annual report for financial year 2023/2024\n\n6 | P a g e", "word_count": 313, "start_char": 20846, "end_char": 22793}

In Uganda v Commissioner\nof Prisons Ex Parte Matovu16, where Matovu was charged for murder and an application\nto be released on bail was made to court and denied, Sir Udo Udoma Egbert ruled that the\nright to bail is a fundamental right, and its denial should only occur under exceptional\ncircumstances. This case set an important precedent regarding the right to bail in Uganda,\naffirming that it should not be denied arbitrarily. In Uganda v Sebbowa17, court held that,”\nthe right to bail is a constitutional right and the onus is on the prosecution to show why\nbail should be denied.” Further, in Uganda v Matovu18, the High Court of Uganda ruled\nthat the prosecutions objections to bail based on the accused’s potential to abscond were\nsufficient to justify denial of bail. Therefore, the practice of bail before 1986 was due to\nsignificant restrictions and limitations like the colonial administrative era influences, postindependence developments and case law precedents.\nWhen the NRM regime took over power in 1986, there still lingered a question on bail\namongst the citizens of Uganda and the applicants for bail. There was confusion as to\nwhether the grant of bail meant an acquittal on the side of the applicants or judicial\ninjustice amongst the public. The citizens found it hard to understand how people charged\nfor serious crimes be walking freely on the streets and sometimes intimidating and\nthreatening the complainants. Why the public had such a view of bail was the fact that an\naccused released on bail used their freedom to interfere with the police investigations to\n\n16 (1966) 1 EA 514\n17 [1968] EA 129\n18 [1970] HCB 134\n\n7 | P a g e", "word_count": 387, "start_char": 22547, "end_char": 24850}

Thus, there was need for a change in the legal system\nto curb the social problems of granting bail to suspects involved in capital offenses.\nThe process of bail application embodies the principle of presumption of innocence20 which\nmeans innocent till proven guilty. Bail strikes a balance between protecting individual\nfreedom and serving the public interest. The primary objective of bail is to ensure the\naccused returns to court for trial, rather than a means of permanent release.\n1.1.2 The laws applicable by the High Court when granting or denying bail\nApplications.\nThe laws applicable for bail are the Constitutional Provisions, Articles 23(6) (a) and (c) on\ndiscretionary and mandatory bail respectively. Article 28(3)(a) on the presumption of\ninnocence. Sections 14 and 15 of the Trial on Indictment Act cap 25. Constitutional (Bail\nGuideline for courts of Judicature) (Practice) Directions, 2022, the Magistrates Courts Act\nCap 16 section 75(2), the Judicature (Criminal Procedure) Application Rules 2 & 4 and the\nJudicature Act section 34.\nThe broad discretion legally coffered to the High Court through the legal framework has\nplayed a very big role on the effectiveness of the current legal framework on bail\napplication in the High Court of Uganda. Due to the classification of the offences by\nlimiting the jurisdiction of bail application for capital offenses to only the High Court as\nseen under section 75(2) of the Magistrates Courts Act, it was intentional by the makers of\nthe laws to grant the High Court with this broad discretion in order to control not only the\neveryday capital offenders, but also the political capital offenders. It is evidenced that\ncapital offences are classified as very grave offences making them more significant than\n\n19 The Uganda Constitutional Review Commission\n20 Article 28(3) of the 1995 Uganda constitution (as amended)\n\n8 | P a g e", "word_count": 359, "start_char": 24633, "end_char": 26780}

They are clearly defined by these laws and given their own bail\napplication procedures.\nThe mandatory bail provisions under the constitution21 are also subject to court discretion\non the basis of protecting public safety and security. This is evidenced in case law\nespecially in high profile political cases of charges like terrorism. For example, the\nBesigye22 bail application case where the Court has denied the applicant bail on three\noccasions on grounds that the charges against the accused are one of the gravest crimes in\nthe country’s books, a crime against the country thus need for public safety and security.\nThe issue of suitable sureties is always subject to court discretion even where the surety\nsatisfies the conditions set by the constitutional bail guidelines. On the issue of grave\nillness, which is one of the exceptional circumstances as provided for under Section 15(3)\nof the Trial on Indictment Act, the law provides for the need for a medical report from the\ninstitution holding the accused in custody to prove that the accused suffers from an illness\nso grave that they cannot handle it. Through court discretion, the court has awarded bail\nin instances where the medical facility of the institution holding the accused in custody\nwent silent on whether they are able to handle the health condition of the accused.\nStringent bail conditions have been set by the High Court in certain bail applications turning\nbail into a privilege.\nIn conclusion bail application in the High Court of Uganda is affected by many factors,\nthough the most important factor affecting the effectiveness of the current legal\nframework on bail application in the High Court of Uganda is the broad discretion leading\n\n21 Article 23(6) (c)\n22 Misc Appln No. 0113 of 2025 (Arising from Criminal Case Nak-Cr.

In practice, however, the bail legal framework demonstrates it to be\ncontradictory and equivocal. The High Court sometimes lays down both rigid and competing\nprerequisites for bail, making bail appear to be a 'privilege and not a right'. In some cases,\njudicial discretion was applied lopsidedly, so the same offences would have different\nresults, while some bail conditions were so wrong they subvert the very right they are meant\nto safeguard.\nThe Bail Guidelines aim to harmonize procedures and ensure transparency, yet questions\npersist regarding their effectiveness in addressing the underlying issues of access, fairness,\nand uniformity in bail determinations. The ongoing gap between the law and its\nimplementation raises concerns about whether the current legal framework for bail in the\nHigh Court of Uganda sufficiently protects the rights of accused individuals while balancing\nthe interests of justice and public safety.\nIn conclusion, this research seeks to critically examine the effectiveness of the current\nlegal framework on bail application in the High Court of Uganda, identifying the challenges\nin its implementation and assessing whether it archives its intended objectives of uploading\nconstitutional rights and ensuring justice for all parties involved.\n\n10 | P a g e", "word_count": 296, "start_char": 28618, "end_char": 30537}

Chapter two discusses the effectiveness of the current legal\nframework on bail application in the High Court of Uganda.

The performance report\nis generated from the analysis of the data from the institutional submissions. It tracks\nprogress and results in information in the outcome areas of the access to Justice/ JLOS\nbusiness to enable the sub program and Development Partners as well as other key\nstakeholders to access progress and target areas for reorganization or increased\ndevelopment. The JLOS financial year reports provided the research with statistical\ninformation on cases disposed of by the High Court in a given financial year. The reports\nalso provided the research with statistics on case backlog whereby the increase in case\nbacklog meant an increase in prisoners on remand providing a case for bail applications\nin the High Court. However, the two JLOS reports of financial years 2021/22 and\n2023/24 that the researcher used, provided general court performance of the High\nCourt. The information is not very clear on the performance of the High Court on bail\napplications for capital offenders which would be used to find the exact effectiveness\nof the current legal framework on bail application.\nThe Report of the Auditor General on the Judiciary for financial year ended\nDecember 2024 was used to try to find statistics on the number of bail applications\nheard by the High Court in a given financial year.

However, the handbook is silent on many things like the effectiveness of these\nlaws on bail application in the High Court. It does not expound on the meaning of\nexceptional circumstances and does not expound on the relationship between the\npresumption of innocence and the right to bail.\nThe Review of Bail in the Criminal Justice System, a study report of November 2020 by\nthe Uganda Law Reform Commission provided the research with the law applicable on\nbail application in all courts of Uganda.

This definition is so clear that any\naverage individual can understand clearly what bail is. It also states that it’s not\nmandatory that a surety must be provided in order to be granted bail. However, for\ncapital offences, the addition of a surety to a bail application is so important to both\nthe accused and the Court. Due to the gravity of the offence, for the Court to grant the\naccused bail, they will need a suitable Surety who has control over the accused and will\nmake it that the accused appears for trial as determined by court.\nThe Bail Conditions in the Criminal Justice Systems in Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda and\nTanzania24 was used by the researcher to contrast the bail application laws in the\nneighboring countries of Uganda with those applied in the High Court of Uganda.

We\nhave the international legal framework, regional legal framework and the national legal\nframework. This chapter discusses the effectiveness of the legal frameworks on bail\napplication in the High Court of Uganda.\n2.1 International Legal Framework on bail Application in the High Court of Uganda\nThe international legal framework governing bail applications in the High Court of\nUganda emphasizes the presumption of innocence, minimal pre-trial detention and\nequitable access to liberty as outlined by the key treaties and guidelines Uganda ratified\nto. Below is an analysis of how these principles intersect with Uganda’s domestic bail\nlaws in the High Court.\n2.1.1 Presumption of Innocence\nIn criminal cases, the international legal framework on burden of proof is grounded in\nthe principle of presumption of innocence, which places the burden on the prosecution\nto prove the accused’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt. The International Covenant on\nCivil and Political Rights30 states that everyone charged with a criminal offense shall be\npresumed innocent till proven guilty. The Human Rights Committee’s General Comment\n32 elaborates that the prosecution must carry the burden of proving the charge and\nthat no guilt can be presumed until the charge is established beyond reasonable doubt.\n\n30 Article 14(2)\n\n21 | P a g e", "word_count": 276, "start_char": 45769, "end_char": 47516}

Justice C.A. Ocelli31 held that,” it should be observed that bail application\nis not a trial in the substantive charge for which an applicant is held in custody. No\nevidence of the substantive charge is adduced and the court does not make any\npronouncement on the merits and demerits of the charge.” This means that under a\nbail application, it is the burden of the prosecution to prove why the accused should\nnot be awarded bail.\n2.1.2 Prohibition of Arbitrary Detention\nArbitrary detention is unlawful detention and occurs when an individual is arrested and\ndetained by a government without due process and without the legal protections of a\nfair trial, or when an individual is detained without any legal basis for the deprivation\nof their liberty. In relation to the study, the 1995 Uganda Constitution (as amended),\nArticle 23(6) (c)provides that when an accused is held in custody for an offense only\ntriable by the High Court for over 180 days without trial, the court is mandated to\nrelease them on bail. This means that an accused held in custody for over 180 days\nwithout trial is unlawfully detained.\nIn relation to bail laws in the High Court of Uganda, for detention to be justified or\nlawful, it must be justified by specific risks like flight risks, evidence tampering,\nlikelihood to commit another crime while out on bail and likelihood to abscond trial.\nDetention should not be used as a punitive measure before conviction since the accused\n\n31 Aliphusadi Matovu v Uganda Criminal Miscellaneous Application No. 15 of 2005s\n\n22 | P a g e", "word_count": 327, "start_char": 47271, "end_char": 49174}

Detention should last no longer than necessary\nto achieve the legitimate aims of the criminal process.\nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights32, prohibits arbitrary detention. The\ninstrument promotes human rights in cases relating to personal liberty through the\nprohibition of arbitrary detention. Deviation from the provisions of the Declaration\namounts to violation of commitment to the protection of Human rights under the UDHR.\nUganda is signatory to the declaration and as such has the obligation under international\nlaw to respect, observe and promote all declarations pertaining human rights therein.\nThe ICCPR33 states that anyone arrested or detained on a criminal charge shall be\nentitled to trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial, emphasizing that\npre-trial detention should be the exception rather than the rule. The UN Human Rights\nCommittee interpreted this to mean that detention must be necessary and\nproportionate to prevent risks such as flight, interference with justice or further\noffenses. The United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for Non-Custodial Measures\n(Tokyo Rules)34 specifies that pre-trial detention should be used as the last resort only\nwhen less intrusive measures like bail are insufficient to meet the needs of justice and\npublic safety. The European Convention on Human Rights35, permits deprivation of\nliberty only in connection with the criminal proceedings and requires that detention be\nlawful and justified. The European Court of Human Rights has ruled that detention must\nbe closely scrutinized, reviewed to prevent arbitrariness and undue length. Thus, in\n\n32 Article 9\n33 Article 9\n34 Rule 5.1\n35 Article 5(1) (c)\n\n23 | P a g e", "word_count": 301, "start_char": 48993, "end_char": 50913}

Below is an analysis of\nUganda’s framework compared to neighboring countries drawing from regional treaties,\ndomestic laws and comparative studies.\n2.2.1 African Charter on Human and Peoples ‘Rights\nUpholds the presumption of innocence36 and the right to liberty which is against\narbitrary detentions. Uganda’s 180-day rule aligns with this Article. Article 2-3 of the\nAfrican Charter on Human and People’s Rights prohibits legal discrimination in all\nspheres of life. this is in conformity with the Uganda laws which emphasize equality of\nall before the law. In regards to bail application, the High Court of Uganda is meant to\nconsistently apply the bail laws to each bail applicant on merit. Justice Musalu\nMusene37 noted that discretion in bail matters must be exercised judiciously without\nmalice, ill will or ulterior motives.\n\n36 Article 6\n37 Col (RTD) Kiiza Besigye v Uganda (criminal Application No. 83 of 2016) [2018] UGHCCRD 7 (12 July 2016)\n\n24 | P a g e", "word_count": 286, "start_char": 50691, "end_char": 52450}

All these provisions accept that release on\nbail may be subject to certain conditions. However, the burden rests with the state to\nprove the need for such conditions for the release or detention of the accused.\n2.2.3 Kenya Bail laws\nArticle 49(1)41 guarantees bail as a right unless compelling reasons like flight risk and\nwitness interference. This means bail should be granted as a default position and the\nburden lies on the prosecution to show compelling reasons to justify denial. Bail is a\nconstitutional right in Kenya. Article 49(2) provides that a person shall not be remanded\nin custody for an offense if the offense is punishable by a fine only or by imprisonment\nfor not more than six months. Just like in Uganda, bail is a right but not absolute.\nKenyan Courts may deny bail if compelling reasons exist such as risks of flight,\ninterference with witnesses or threats to public safety. A little contrast to Uganda’s\nbail laws in the High Court is that Kenyan Judicial officers are mandated to treat bail\nas a right rather than a privilege and courts have reduced bail amounts on review to\nuphold this principle.\n\n38 Section M1(e)\n39 The Luanda Guidelines Paragraph 1(b), 4(i), 6(a), 7, 10-11, 31,32 (a)\n40 http://www.achpr.org/legalinstruments/details?id=9\n41 Kenya Constitution 2010\n\n25 | P a g e", "word_count": 317, "start_char": 52180, "end_char": 54090}
{"chunk_id": "DOC0089__00025", "doc_id": "DOC0089", "chunk_index": 25, "text": "2.2.4 Tanzania Bail laws\nLike in Kenya and Uganda, bail is recognized as a constitutional right. Article 13(6)(b)\nof the Constitution of United Republic of Tanzania (1977, as amended), every person\ncharged with a criminal offense is presumed innocent until proven guilty and is entitled\nto bail as a matter of right, subject to conditions prescribed by court. Denies bail for\noffenses like murder unless exceptional circumstances are shown. This position mirrors\nUganda’s position on bail. the Bail and Bond policy (2016) encourages non-monetary\nbail and mandates periodic judicial reviews. This is inconsistent with Uganda’s position\nwhere cash bail is practiced and emphasized more than non-monetary bail.\n2.2.5 Burundi\nIn Burundi, the legal frame work on bail indicates that bail is not the right but its\napplication is the right. This is so consistent with Uganda’s bail laws. The Judiciary has\nthe discretion to grant or deny the accused bail based on the seriousness of the offense\nand risk of absconding trial. The Criminal Procedure Code (2013) explicitly denies bail\nfor crimes punishable by over 20 years.

Article 28(3)(a) provides for the presumption\nof innocence of an accused to always be considered by the High Court whenever\ndetermining a bail application. Articles 23(6)(a)(c) and 28(3)(a) should be applied\nconcurrently during bail applications in the High Court of Uganda. In Aliphusadi Matovu\nv Uganda51, court held that under Article 28(3)(a) of the constitution, the applicant for\nbail is presumed innocent until the contrary is proven. That being the case, he or she\nshould get bail until substituted trial is proved. Justice C.A. Ocelli held in response\nthat,” it should be observed that bail application is not a trial in the substantive charge\nfor which an applicant is held in custody. No evidence of the substantive charge is\nadduced and the court does not make any pronouncement on the merits and demerits\nof the charge.” Guideline 5 of the bail Guidelines provides the general principles a court\nmy take into account while considering a bail application and the presumption of\ninnocence is one of the principles. This case showed the importance of the presumption\nof innocence in a bail application.\nWhile Article 23(6) guarantees the right to apply for bail and mandates release after\n180 days on remand without trial, courts conflict over whether it confers a right to bail\nor merely a right to apply for bail.

There is a lot of inconsistency in bail decisions with similar facts. In Mathew\nKanyamunyu &Ors v Uganda58, where three parties were jointly accused of murder,\nbail was awarded to the principal offender alone.

Thus, the law should be changed to mean place\nowned by the accused and should be included onto their recognizance so as in case they\nabscond, it’s taken over by the court.\n\n81 (HCT-00-ICT-CM-0021-2019) [2020] UGHCICD 1 (8 January 2020)\n82 [1992-1993] HCB 52\n\n40 | P a g e", "word_count": 281, "start_char": 78469, "end_char": 80027}

A surety is that person who\ntakes on the legal responsibility of ensuring that the accused appears in court at the\nappointed time. This is a person who guarantees to court that upon the grant of bail to\nan accused, the accused will return to court every time he or she is required to attend\nhis or her trial. In Mugera John v Uganda83, court stated that a surety should possess\na certain amount of authority or influence over the bail applicant. In Kawanguzi\nNsereko David V Uganda84, court was of the view that the role of a surety goes beyond\nthe ability to forfeit the bond, bail is not designed as an income generating avenue for\ncourts to which bail applications are made. What is pertinent about sureties is that\nthere must be indication that they have been advised of their roles as sureties, they\nidentified themselves properly and have shown and proved their authoritative\nrelationships in respect to the applicants showing that they are able to exercise their\nauthority and command appearance of the applicant in the court when needed. Justice\nStephen Mubiru in Abindi & Anor v Uganda85 stated that, “An applicant should not be\nincarcerated if he, has sound sureties capable of guaranteeing that he will comply with\nthe conditions of his or her bail and is willing to abide by all other conditions set by the\ncourt.” In the case of R v Kifampa86,the High Court of Uganda held that the accused’s\nfailure to provide sureties was sufficient grounds for denying bail.\n\n83 Criminal Misc Application (ICD) No. 0021/2025\n84 Misc Appln No. 426 of 2023\n85 (Miscellaneous Criminal Application No.20 of 2016) [2017] UGHCCRD 49(4pril 2017)\n86 [1964] EA 432\n\n41 | P a g e", "word_count": 387, "start_char": 79692, "end_char": 81919}
{"chunk_id": "DOC0089__00041", "doc_id": "DOC0089", "chunk_index": 41, "text": "The provision for a suitable surety in a bail application in the High Court of Uganda\nensures that the applicant will not abscond from trial which is the main factor in the\ngrant of bail. However, the High Court at times sets very stringent conditions for\nsureties due to the discretion they possess in determining bail applications. Even when\nthe surety meets the provided legal conditions as stated, court can refuse them on\ngrounds of suitability or gravity of the offence. This can be seen in the case of\nTumusiime David v Uganda87, where Hon. Justice Ssekaana held that he was\nuncomfortable with cousins even if they had fixed places of abode. That sureties must\nbe credible, independent and financially stable. Their role is not merely ceremonial but\nrequires a proven ability to supervise the accused effectively, ensure adherence to bail\nconditions and bear financial liability if the accused absconds.\nPending Charges against the accused\nIn case the accused is facing pending charges in different cases, the court will take into\naccount the weight of the charges when deciding on a bail application. Thus, although\nsections 15(1)(a) and section 15(3) of the TIA necessitate the accused to prove the\nexceptional circumstances in order to be granted bail, the existence of pending court\ncharges influences the courts position of granting the accused bail. If the applicant is a\nhabitual criminal with previous convictions, this would suggest that the applicant is\nlikely to commit more offence when released and therefore bail maybe refused for this\nreason.
