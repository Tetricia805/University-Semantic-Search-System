Introduction\nThe Christian Church today is marked by a great diversity of denominations, each\ninterpreting and practicing the sacraments in different ways. Among the most debated is the\nrite of baptism, particularly the question of whether it should be administered to infants or\nreserved for adults. The former is referred to as infant baptism or paedobaptism and the latter\nis called credo baptism.1\nInfant baptism, also known as paedobaptism, is more than just a symbolic ritual. It is a sacramental practice that involves the practice of baptizing infants or young children. It has been\nembraced by the majority of Christian traditions throughout history in an attempt to align\nwith the New Testament model of baptism of including children within the Church community.2 According to Ben. L. Rose, infant baptism is an acknowledgement of Church membership. The infant by this rite is accepted as a Church member, which is the Lord’s congregation, the household and God’s family.3 In this sense, baptism is less about the infant’s personal choice and more about God’s grace and the Church’s responsibility to nurture faith\nWithin the Reformed tradition, infant baptism is understood to be covenantal and promissory\nin nature. The baptized child is included in the life of the church, but is not a full member of\nthe church until he or she is able to confess the faith, thereby claiming the promise of salvation offered in the rite of baptism. Things are rather different for those who come to faith later\nin life and are baptized as believers (either as adolescents or adults). For in that case, there is\na clear relation between belief and the rite: one believes and is baptized. But in the case of\ninfants, it seems that faith follows baptism, often by some years. The idea is that the child is\n\n1 Wisdom begun. Infant baptism vs. Adult baptism. 2025.\n2 Oliver D. University of St Andrews, Fife, Scotland, UK.p1\n3 Ben. L. Rose.Central Presbyterian Church.

The Church maintains that infants cannot be separated\nfrom the divine plan of God and the Anglican rubric in the Book of Common Prayer, instructs\nthe church adherents:\nThat they defer not the baptism of their children longer than the first or second Sunday next\nafter their birth, or other holy-day falling between, unless upon a great and reasonable\ncause, to be approved by the curate. And also they shall warn them, that without like great\ncause and necessity they procure not their children to be baptized at home in their houses.\nBut despite its widespread practice, infant baptism has been without any doubt an objectionable issue for many years among many Christian denominations. Those that do not practice it\nbelieve that infant baptism is not necessary due to their own way of interpreting the scripture.\nThey argue that infants are not capable of professing or confessing Jesus, and they maintain\nthe view that a conscious faith is required for baptism, while advocating for the baptism of\nonly adults capable of affirming their faith in Jesus.5 Others on the other hand, view infants\nas sinless and therefore do not need baptism. This variation is a clear indication that there has\nbeen a decline in the understanding of infant baptism especially among the evangelical\nchurches and this decline has been attributed to the influence of revivalism in evangelical cycles, and the emphasis on baptism which follows an individual’s profession of faith.6\nThis paper, therefore, aims to explain why the practice of infant baptism should be upheld\nwithin the Province of the Church of Uganda by fostering a better understanding of it. It begins by introducing and defining the concept of infant baptism. It then examines the practice\nin both the Bible and Church history.

Finally, it concludes\nby presenting theological, pastoral, and historical arguments and those from silence, all in\nsupport of infant baptism.\n\nSection II. Infant Baptism in the Bible\nThe biblical basis for infant baptism is often drawn by analogy with the Old Testament practice of circumcision. God commanded Abraham to circumcise all male children in his household at eight days old as a sign of the covenant (Genesis 17:10–12). This covenant sign was\ngiven before a child could profess faith, showing that God’s promises extended even to infants. Christ himself underwent circumcision at eight days old (Luke 2:21). Wayne Vogt argues that this replacement of circumcision with baptism is one of the strongest supports for\ninfant baptism.7\n\nPaul makes a theological connection between circumcision and baptism in Colossians 2:11–\n14. He speaks of the “circumcision of Christ” (his death on the cross) and explains that believers were “buried with him in baptism and raised with him.” This highlights the continuity\nbetween circumcision and baptism as covenant signs, each pointing to God’s work of grace\nand the believer’s inclusion in His covenant family, as explained further below.\nBoth circumcision and baptism are covenant signs, outward badges of belonging to God’s\nfamily. In the Old Testament, circumcision marked Israel as God’s people, while in the New\nTestament; baptism marks those in Christ’s covenant community. Neither act itself creates\nthe relationship with God but points to the deeper reality of belonging to Him.\nBoth signify inclusion. Circumcision was given to Israelite boys shortly after birth, showing\nthey were part of God’s people from the start. In the same way, infant baptism brings children\ninto the visible Christian community under God’s promises, even before they can express\nfaith.\n\n7 Kenneth Oppong, Tony Ogouma, Peter Obeng Man.

Abraham’s circumcision was called a seal of the righteousness that\ncomes by faith (Romans 4:11). Baptism also points to faith and union with Christ—\nconfirming belief in adults and expressing trust that infants will grow into covenant faith.\nBoth symbolize cleansing. Circumcision hinted at the need for a purified heart, turning from\nsin toward God. Baptism makes this imagery clearer, as water signifies washing away sin and\nbeginning new life through the Holy Spirit.8 Circumcision was intended for the children of\nbelieving parents. Through Jesus Christ, baptism now serves as the replacement for circumcision. Consequently, baptism remains for the children of believing parents, as well as for new\nadult believers.9.\n\nThe Great Commission provides another foundation. Jesus commanded his disciples: “Go\nand make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and\nof the Holy Spirit” (Matthew 28:18). Since children are part of “all nations,” this passage is\nunderstood to include them. Nowhere in Scripture does Jesus forbid the baptism of children.\nAs Wayne Vogt points out, those who oppose infant baptism cannot cite any biblical text excluding them. Similarly, in Mark 16:16, belief and baptism are linked with salvation, but\nchildren are not exempted from this promise.\n\nThe practice of infant baptism finds another basis in the household or oikos formula.\nAccording to Wayne Vogt, this formula offers strong evidence. The New Testament contains\nvarious references to the baptism of entire households (Acts 16:15, Acts 16:33, 1 Corinthians\n1:16). It is assumed that such household baptisms would encompass infants and children.\nAnother significant basis is found in the household or oikos formula. According to Wayne\nVogt, this formula offers strong evidence. The New Testament contains various references to\nthe baptism of entire households.Examples include Lydia (Acts 16:15), the Philippian jailer\n\n8Phillip Kayser.

This indicates that God’s promises\nextend to children as well as adults. Similarly, Paul in 1 Corinthians 7:14 teaches that the\nchildren of believers are “holy,” meaning set apart to God. If God regards them as holy,\nwithholding baptism would contradict their covenant status..\n\nFinally, the attitude of Jesus himself provides support. In Matthew 19:13–15, Jesus welcomed\nlittle children, took them in his arms, and blessed them, despite the disciples’ attempts to turn\nthem away. Though not directly about baptism, this passage demonstrates Christ’s willingness to receive and bless children, even before they could understand. If Jesus blessed them,\nit follows that the Church should also recognize their inclusion in God’s covenant community\nthrough baptism. 11\n\n10 Kenneth Oppong, Tony Ogouma, Peter Obeng Man.

Infant Baptism in History\nIt is a well-established fact that infant baptism has been widely practiced in the majority of\nChurches since at least 250 A.D. While not all scholars agree that it existed in the earliest\nyears of the Church, several historical records prior to that date indicate that the baptism of\ninfants was already common in the first and second centuries.12\nOne of the earliest witnesses is Irenaeus, who, writing before his death around 200 A.D., affirmed: “For He (the Lord) came to save all through Himself—infants, little children, boys,\nyouths, and the elderly—who through Him are born again in God.” This statement implies\nthat baptism, as the means of new birth, was extended to infants. As Vogt observes, Irenaeus\nwas a student and close friend of Polycarp, who himself had been a disciple of the Apostle\nJohn. Thus, less than a century separated Irenaeus from the apostolic age, and his testimony\ncarries significant weight. Moreover, Irenaeus was widely regarded as one of the most doctrinally sound teachers of his time.\nA generation later, Origen, who died around 250 A.D., wrote, “The church received from the\napostles the tradition to give even little children to baptism.” This statement shows that he\nregarded infant baptism as an established practice dating back to the apostles, and he felt no\nneed to argue for it.\nAlso, Tertullian, who died around 225 A.D., while not dismissing infant baptism as invalid\nafter having written extensively on baptism, advised delaying its administration. His concern\nwas that baptized children, and particularly their sponsors, might fail to fulfill their commitments. He wrote: “Let them (children) come when they are older; let them come when they\nare able to learn and be taught whether they should come; let them become Christians when\nthey can truly know Christ” 13\n\n12 Wayne Vogt.

His writings also make it clear that infant baptism was not something new, otherwise, he probably would have criticized it for being a recent invention. Since he never made\nthat argument, it suggests that infant baptism was already an accepted tradition, not something the Church or the Apostles had just introduced.\nAnother important witness, Hippolytus, writing around 215 A.D., stated: “First you should\nbaptize the little ones. Those who can speak for themselves should do so, but for those who\ncannot, their parents or another family member should speak. Then baptize the grown men,\nand lastly the women” (Apostolic Traditions, 21, 4f). This order of baptism demonstrates that\nthe baptism of infant was common in his time. To deny this would require an unusually\nstrained line of reasoning.\nFinally, around 250 A.D., Bishop Fidus raises a question to the Council of Carthage\nregarding whether baptism should be postponed until the eighth day. The council concluded\nthat it should not be delayed arbitrarily (Epistle 64, 2-6). The very terms of the discussion\nreveal that infant baptism was already widely practiced and uncontested at that time. There\nwas no serious debate over whether infants should be baptized; it was universally accepted.\nThe only issue under discussion was whether baptism should follow the eighth-day timing\nprescribed for Old Testament circumcision. Following that council, a considerable body of\nevidence shows that infants were regularly baptized, so much so that even those who opposed\nthe practice did not deny that it was common after 250 A.D.14\n\nSection IV. Objections to Infant Baptism in the Bible\nOpponents of infant baptism often appeal to New Testament passages such as Romans 6:3–4,\n1 Corinthians 12:13, Galatians 3:27–28, and Colossians 2:11–12. Their argument is that\nbaptism in Scripture is consistently tied to personal faith in Christ, and therefore only those\nwho consciously believe should receive it.15\n\n14 Wayne Vogt.

It symbolizes what has already\ntaken place inwardly—repentance, faith, and new life through the Spirit. Without genuine\nfaith, baptism loses its meaning and becomes an empty ritual. For this reason, baptism should\nonly be administered to those who have consciously embraced the gospel and can publicly\nconfess Christ as Lord.\n\nIn line with this reasoning, these critics also emphasize that these passages portray baptism as\na symbol of purification from sins, a cleansing that can only be received through faith in\nJesus Christ. Since infants are not capable of exercising personal faith or repentance, they\ncannot yet experience the reality that baptism is meant to signify. To baptize those who do\nnot believe reduces the ordinance to a mere ritual without the saving reality it represents.\nTherefore, baptism should be reserved for those who personally believe in Christ, because\nonly they can experience the forgiveness and cleansing that the sacrament points to.16\nFurthermore more, opponents of infant baptism raise several objections based on passages\ncommonly cited in its support. Their argument is that these texts, when read carefully, point\nto baptism following personal faith rather than its extension to infants. The following is a\nsummary of Objections to Infant Baptism in Key Passages.\nActs 2:38–39\n\nPaedobaptists interpret Peter’s words, “the promise is for you and your children,” as including infants. Critics, however, respond that the promise is not restricted to children of believers but extends to “all who are far off,” that is, everyone “whom the Lord our God will call.”\nIf this call refers to the outward preaching of the gospel, it applies to all hearers; if it refers to\nthe inward call of God, it applies only to the elect. Furthermore, Acts 2:41 clarifies that\n“those who received his word were baptized,” implying conscious acceptance of the message.\nThus, baptism here is reserved for believers, not infants.17\n\nColossians 2:11–12\n\n16 Scott J.

Critics, while\nacknowledging a parallel between the two rites, argue that Paul’s focus is different. He explicitly links baptism with spiritual renewal: the putting off of the sinful nature and being\nraised with Christ through faith. Since infants cannot exercise such faith, this passage is seen\nas affirming believer’s baptism rather than infant baptism.\nHousehold Baptisms in Acts\nSeveral accounts of household baptisms are cited in defense of infant baptism. Yet opponents\nargue that in every case, baptism follows personal faith. For instance, in Acts 16:32–34, the\nPhilippian jailer’s entire household first heard the gospel, and then believed, rejoiced, and\nwere baptized together. Critics conclude that the household baptisms demonstrate a consistent\npattern of baptism based on belief, not indiscriminate application to infants.\n1 Corinthians 7:14\n\nPaedobaptists sometimes argue that children of at least one believing parent are “holy” in a\ncovenantal sense and therefore eligible for baptism. Critics respond that Paul uses the same\nterm “holy” for the unbelieving spouse, showing that holiness here is relational, not covenantal. The child’s holiness arises from association with a believing parent, not from a covenant\nstatus that warrants baptism. Applying the verse only to children while excluding the unbelieving spouse is, in their view, a misinterpretation.18\n\nIn summary, critics contend that the passages often cited to support infant baptism instead\nemphasize baptism as a response to personal faith. They argue that applying these texts to\ninfants misrepresents their meaning and does not align with the New Testament pattern of\nbaptism for believers.\n\n18 Greg WeltyA Critical Evaluation of Infant Baptist. pp18-19\n\nSection V.

Earlier, in the fourth century, some\nChurch leaders such as Basil, Ambrose, Chrysostom, Jerome, and Augustine postponed\nbaptism until later in life. For them baptism was viewed less as a sacrament of incorporation\ninto the Church and more as a sacrament of pardon.19 From the tenth to the thirteenth century,\nthe Neo-Manicheans objected to infant baptism on the grounds that infants could not yet\nbelieve. They appealed to a literal reading of Mark 16:16: “He who believes and is baptized\nwill be saved; he who does not believe will be condemned.” Since infants cannot believe,\nthey argued, they could not receive baptism validly.20\nAt the time of the Reformation these concerns reemerged with new force. In 1523 Andreas\nBodenstein von Karlstadt began advocating that baptism should be delayed until a child could\nunderstand its meaning. Soon afterward, in places such as Wytikon and Zollikon, parents\nrefused to have their infants baptized, preferring instead to wait until their children reached\nmaturity and could choose sponsors for themselves. This rejection of infant baptism, and the\ndemand that baptism be given only to believers, gave rise to the nickname “Anabaptists” or\n“rebaptizers,” a movement that became a defining mark of the Radical Reformation.21\nFrom that point on, infant baptism became one of the most objectionable practices in the\nWestern Church. To the Anabaptists it was even a scandal, while in later centuries some Baptists, in reexamining their own tradition, began to question their rejection of infant baptism\nand their practice of rebaptizing converts\nContemporary Objections:\nAlthough theology guarantees the ex opere operato validity of infant baptism, its practice\ncontinues to raise concern today.

What is at stake is not\nonly a right understanding of baptism but also the very missionary nature and mission of the\nChurch. And while this debate is most evident in countries where Christian influence is fading, the Church in Uganda, too, cannot afford to ignore it.22 Some of the current objections to\nthe practice of infant baptism are as discussed below:\nTo begin with, some people argue that baptizing infants limits their personal freedom. They\nclaim it undermines the dignity of the child to place upon them religious obligations they\nmight one day choose to reject. From this perspective, baptism should be delayed until a person is old enough to make a free and conscious commitment. Until then, parents and teachers\nshould avoid influencing the decision.23\nIn addition, critics point to the pastoral origins of the practice, claiming that it reflects more\nconcern with administering sacraments than with stirring faith or promoting evangelization.\nCritics maintain that by retaining infant baptism, the Church prioritizes numbers and social\nestablishment over true missionary outreach. This, they argue, fosters a “magical” understanding of the sacraments, whereas what is really needed is an approach that nurtures conscious faith, supports genuine personal commitment, and positions baptism within a gradual\nprocess of spiritual growth.24\nAnother concern, raised by Alister E. Mc Grath (529) in his book, 'Christian Theology' brings\nout Karl Barth's argument on the significance of infant baptism that the practice weakens the\ncentral link between baptism and Christian discipleship. He emphasizes that baptism is a\nwitness to the grace of God, and makes the beginning of the human response to the grace and\nthat infants cannot meaningfully make this response.25\nFurther objection, presented by Richard Kenneth Atkins (8) in his article, ‘Peirce’s Modal\nDefense of Infant Baptism', raises the obvious Baptist's view that a baptized infant does not\n\n22 Argentina Richard X.

In support of infant Baptistism\nDespite widespread criticism, infant baptism rests on strong foundations and is supported by\nseveral convincing reasons. The arguments discussed below approach the practice from biblical, historical, pastoral, and theological perspectives, including arguments from silence, in\nresponse to the objections raised above.\nThe critics’ view of baptism that looks at it as a visible sign of a believer’s personal trust in\nChrist and commitment to follow Him, as seen in the New Testament, ends up being focused\nmainly on people rather than on God. It makes baptism mean only a response to an inward\nchange, instead of a sign of God’s grace. But covenant signs, like baptism, are signs of God’s\ncovenant of grace. They are about His gracious promise, not about our personal commitment.\nJust as circumcision was a sign of God’s covenant promises, baptism is also a sign of God’s\nfaithfulness in Christ. Through baptism, God promises salvation to the believer. However, if\na child grows up and never responds in faith, that same covenant brings judgment instead of\nblessing.\nCovenant signs are not just individual but also communal—they mark a person as belonging\nto the covenant family, the people of God.

But this does not mean that only those who already believe should be\nbaptized. The sign of baptism should not be confused with the actual reality it points to.\nChildren of believers are baptized with the hope that, in time, they will come to faith and\nreceive the true purification from sin. If we reject this, we would also have to reject\ncircumcision in the Old Testament. Circumcision also symbolized the removal of sin and\nbeing set apart to serve God, yet it was given to infants. For that reason, it makes sense that\ninfants can be baptized too. 27\nWhile the critics argue that Acts 2:39 does not give a covenant promise to children, the text\nitself shows otherwise. Peter explicitly says, “The promise is for you and for your children.”\nThis deliberate inclusion demonstrates continuity with God’s covenant dealings in the Old\nTestament, where children were always included within the covenant community and\nreceived the covenant sign. Far from abolishing this principle at Pentecost, Peter reaffirms it,\nshowing that children remain within the covenant community. The call to repentance and\nfaith applies to all, but the covenant sign (baptism) is still placed on believers and their\nchildren, just as circumcision had been. Thus, Acts 2:39 supports, rather than excludes the\nbaptism of covenant children.\n\nThe objection raised against infant baptism in Colossians 2:11–12 focuses only on personal\nfaith and inward transformation, thereby excluding infants from baptism. However, Paul’s\npoint is not to separate circumcision from baptism but to show that both point to the same\nreality—Christ’s death, burial, and resurrection. Circumcision looked forward to what Christ\nwould accomplish, while baptism looks back to what He has accomplished. Since\ncircumcision was given to infants as a sign of belonging to God’s people, and Paul directly\nconnects it with baptism, it follows that baptism should also be given to infants.28\n\n27 Scott J.

For example: Lydia: “She was baptized, and her household” (Acts 16:15), The\nPhilippian Jailer: “He and his entire household were baptized” (Acts 16:33) and the Household of Stephanas: Paul writes, “I did baptize also the household of Stephanas” (1 Corinthians 1:16).\nIn each case, the text emphasizes the inclusion of the entire household rather than specifying\nonly adult believers.\nWhile the biblical texts do not specify the ages of the household members, it is improbable\nthat these households were composed only of adults. In the cultural context of the first century, households typically included not only parents but also children, extended family, and\nservants with their children. Thus, the natural reading of “household” would reasonably include infants and young children.\nAdmittedly, these passages do not directly prove that infants were baptized. But they do make\nthe practice very possible. Since whole households were baptized without any limits mentioned, it makes sense to believe that children, even infants, were included. When this is\ncombined with other biblical and theological reasons, household baptisms give strong support\nfor infant baptism.29\nIn 1 Corinthians 7:14, Paul makes a clear distinction between the unbelieving spouse and\nthe child of a believer. The unbelieving spouse is said to be “sanctified” through the believer,\nbut he describes the children of one believing parent as “holy.” This difference in wording\nand emphasis indicates that Paul is not equating the two in the same way. The child is\ndeclared holy based upon the parent’s faith and trust in the Lord. Paul is not speaking here of\nsubjective inward holiness, but to objective holiness. That is, he is speaking of holiness\nregarding connection and privilege. The children are holy because they are being raised in a\nhome under the guidance of holiness and the teachings of Christ. This means that such a child\nis set apart and included in the community of God’s people and as a result, they are not to be\n\n29 Wayne Vogt.The Biblical Substantiation for Infant Baptism.

And that is exactly why the church has\nhistorically recognized them as rightful recipients of the covenant sign of baptism.30\n\nIn response to the historical objections, infant baptism has been widely practiced and justified\nwithin the Church from its earliest centuries. Even before Augustine, baptism was understood\nas the forgiveness of sins, which initially raised questions regarding infants, who had committed no personal sin. Early Church leaders, however, defended the practice. Chrysostom,\nfor instance, explained that infants are baptized so that they may receive justice, adoption,\ninheritance, and grace—becoming members of Christ and temples of the Holy Spirit. Baptism\nwas therefore seen as the means by which children were incorporated into the covenant\ncommunity from the very beginning of life.\nOver time, theologians sought to explain how baptism could be applied to those unable to express personal faith. Augustine and later scholars argued that the faith of the Church compensates for the infant’s lack of personal faith, a view that was further developed by Peter\nLombard through the distinction of munus and usus—habit and act of faith. Historical figures such as Aquinas and Bonaventure synthesized these ideas, showing that the Church’s\nfaith prepared the infant for baptism, and the sacrament itself communicated this faith to the\nchild.\nThe historical acceptance of infant baptism was confirmed and reinforced through councils\nand official Church declarations. The Council of Vienne in 1312 recognized the doctrine as\nprobable, while the Council of Trent formally affirmed that baptism confers all theological\nvirtues, including faith. Subsequent statements, including those at Florence, the 20th-century\nMonitum, and Pope Paul VI’s Credo, demonstrate the Church’s consistent defense of infant\nbaptism across the centuries.\nEven during the Reformation, when groups such as the Anabaptists rejected infant baptism,\nthe practice was widely upheld by both Catholics and most Protestant traditions, showing its\nbroad historical continuity. This enduring practice reflects the Church’s longstanding view\n\n30 Jason Helopoulos . The Controversy about Infant Baptism.

Even naturally, parents make decisions that are crucial for their child’s\nlife and moral formation. Even choosing not to guide a child’s religious life is itself a choice,\none that may withhold something important.\nBaptism does not take away freedom. Every person has responsibilities to God, and baptism\nrecognizes these while welcoming the child as God’s own. The New Testament presents joining the Christian life not as forced, but as the way to true freedom.\nA child might later resist the duties of baptism. This can be painful for parents, but it does not\nmean they were wrong to baptize and raise the child in faith. Even if faith seems dormant, the\nseeds planted can grow later, nourished by the parents’ love, prayers, and faithful example.31\nThe objection that infant baptism undermines evangelistic passion and reduces baptism to\nmere ritual misses the richer meaning of the practice. While the Church indeed seeks to\nawaken faith and encourage mature discipleship, the sacrament’s necessity applies equally to\nchildren, who are baptized not by personal profession but within the faith of the Church. Far\nfrom being a concession to numbers or social establishment, infant baptism reflects the\nChurch’s duty to extend Christ’s saving grace universally, incorporating even children into\nHis body. It is, in fact, deeply missionary, showing that salvation begins with God’s free initiative: “He first loved us” (1 Jn 4:19), and “He saved us... through the washing of rebirth\nand renewal by the Holy Spirit” (Tit 3:5). Far from diminishing missionary zeal, baptizing\ninfants proclaims God’s mercy from the very start of life and commits the Church to fostering\nthat gift toward mature faith.32\nBarth’s objection to the practice of infant baptism could limit how much God's grace can\nreach.

For\ninstance the baptism of the entire household, including children in Acts 16:33. Hubmaier also\nseems not to have understood baptism as an act of God's grace, initiation into the Christian\ncommunity, and incorporation into the body of Christ rather other than just as an individual's\nexpression of faith.\nFurthermore, this argument doesn't consider other ways people understand baptism in Christianity. Some Christians recognize the validity of infant baptism based on theological traditions and scriptural interpretations different from Hubmaier's idea. Therefore, dismissing infant baptism as \"not real baptism,\" makes this argument too simple and ignores the many different beliefs and practices in Christianity\nPeter Nyende, in his article “Prepared to Believe: The Evangelism of Pre-schoolers and\nInfant Baptism in African Anglican Churches”, observes and gives a summary of the\nsignificance of infant baptism.

This act signifies the child's inclusion in God's family and marks the\nbeginning of their spiritual journey. And through baptism, the child is welcomed into the\nChurch and becomes a part of the broader Christian community, receiving the grace and\nblessings of God from infancy.\nLet’s also consider arguments from silence in response to the criticism of this practice. But\nfirst, let's begin by asking: why not baptize infants? To those who oppose it, we pose a question: \"Do you aim to adhere strictly to biblical principles? Then where does Scripture expressly prohibit infant baptism? Can you point to a specific verse?\" The truth is, no such\nverse exists—there's no scriptural prohibition against infant baptism, nor any verse that contradicts its practice.\nThis inquiry can be extended: Where in the Bible can we locate a verse wherein the children\nof believers are not granted the sign of the covenant? In what instances do children of believers need to reach adulthood, or at least their teenage years, before being baptized? Where are\nthey instructed to wait for this? And where do we find biblical guidance on preparing the\nchildren of believers for baptism in their later years?\nWhile it's an argument from silence, it's still an argument. It's worth acknowledging the absence of a clear scriptural command regarding infant baptism. The instances of it in the New\nTestament, particularly the two household baptisms in Philippi (Acts 16), have sparked debates. Interestingly, Paul instructs the Philippian church to maintain the practices he taught\nthem (Phil 4:9). David Peterson, former Principal of Oak Hill Theological College in London,\nsuggests that it's highly unlikely that there were no babies included in any of the four household baptisms described by Luke.\nIn the New Testament, there are various instances where specific commands are not clearly\ngiven for certain actions. For instance, while polygamy is considered wrong, neither Paul nor\nPeter directly addressed it. They assumed that Christians understood its wrongness based on\nthe teachings of the Old Testament, just as they assumed Christians recognized the wrongness\nof a Christian man marrying his sister or aunt. Similarly, the New Testament doesn't expressly mandate that women partake in the Lord’s Supper, yet we don't withhold the bread and\nwine from them.

Arguments from silence exist on\nboth sides, yet the argument isn't based on a specific verse's explicit command. It clear that\nthe debate isn't just about interpreting a few specific verses; it's about understanding the overall structure and message of the Bible. So, it's important to approach the debate with kindness\ntowards those who disagree and the humility to patiently discuss and consider different viewpoints.35\n\nSection VII. Conclusion\nThe topic of infant baptism is actually without any doubt an objectionable one. Believers\nfrom various Christian denominations are unable to view it similarly. Much as they read the\nsame Bible, and profess their faith to be guided by the same Spirit, they arrive at different\nconclusions about this type of baptism. make different conclusion in regard to this form of\nbaptism.\nA greater number of Christians believe that the practice of infant baptism is Scripturally supported while only a small one comprising of mainly those from Pentecostal Churches look at\ninfant baptism as a practice with no scriptural basis and wrong to perform it.\nSuch views should not bring confusion and division among the Christians of the province of\nthe Church of Uganda but rather they should hold on to the doctrine of the Church in regard\nto the practice.\nThe worldwide Anglican Church, where the province of the Church of Uganda falls under\nmuch as it is autonomous plainly declares in the 27th Article of religion that ‘the baptism of\nyoung children is in any wise to be retained, as most agreeable with the institution of Christ.’\nThis is supported by the numerous Biblical Scholars and other writers whose theological\nviews are in support of the practice.\nAnd while it may be difficult for infants to understand that baptism brings about a spiritual\nrebirth to people, making them become God's children who have entered into a life that is\ndivine thus making the baptized become members of Christ’s body (The Church)., they are\nbasic to the Christian faith.

Through this ritual, the infant is\nacknowledged as a member of the church, which constitutes the assembly of the Lord and\nGod's family. The believers' children are church members by birth and the sacrament of\nbaptism acknowledges that membership in a public manner. Similarly, the kids that are born\ninto the barn belong to the goat’s herder of the flock and are identified with the goat herder's\nmark. If the she-goat belongs to the goat herder, the kids belong to him too and he marks\nthem as his own. The kids that are born into the barn of the Good goat’s herder belong to Him\nand are identified with His mark in baptism. If the goats are His, the Kids are His also and He\nmarks them as His own in the sacrament of baptism.\nChildren born to believers, who are acknowledged through baptism as church members, are\nregistered as \"non-communing members.\" They do not have access to all the benefits of full\nmembership, as they are not allowed to participate in the sacrament of the Lord's Supper or to\nvote in congregational meetings. However, upon coming of age and after they have made\ntheir own decision to confirm their faith in the Lord Jesus Christ through a credible\nprofession, they are registered as full Church members, with all the rights and privileges\nassociated with it, including participation in Communion. Since they were baptized as\ninfants, there is no need for them to be re-baptized.", "word_count": 373, "start_char": 47902, "end_char": 50122}

When parents bring their children for\nbaptism, they claim the benefits of their children to the Covenant of Grace and the blessings\npromised to be given by the Lord. This extends not only to believers but also to their\nchildren, as children of believing parents have always been included in God's covenantal\nblessings (Genesis 9:9; 17:7; Exodus 20:5; Deuteronomy 29:10-13). For instance, in Joel\n2:28, the prophet proclaims, “And afterward, I will pour out my Spirit on all people. Your\nsons and daughters will prophesy, your old men will dream dreams, your young men will see\nvisions. Children born to believing parents are included in the Covenant, and their parents\nhave the right to claim its benefits for them through the sacrament of baptism. Therefore,\n\nwhen parents present their children for baptism, they claim for those children the rich legacy\nwilled by God to them in Jesus Christ. The richest benefits which parents claim for their\nchildren in this sacrament are the Holy Spirit and everlasting Life. Thus, from the moment of\nbaptism, children begin receiving the Covenant's benefits and the blessings given by God\nthrough Christ. 36\n\nLastly, infant baptism signifies the washing away of original sin and regeneration. In the case\nof new-born infants, the old life which they come with is to be left behind, the defilement of\nwhich is to be washed away, and from which regeneration is to be sought. The remedy was\nfound in the doctrine of original sin. All people born into the world are born in a fallen state,\ninterpreted in various ways: as a corruption of human nature or as the loss of the supernatural\nlife originally given to Adam.

And as a tradition that serves as a visible sign of God's grace and the\ninitiation of children into the covenant community of faith, the adherents of the Church and\nthose from other Christian denominations that practice it should continue embracing it; taking\ninto consideration that the practice has a Biblical basis and it also remains a valid sacramental\nrite whenever it is administered in the Triune Name. And so, regardless of the position of\nthose who object its practice, it is clearly evident that infant baptism holds profound\ntheological significance and continues to shape the beliefs and practices of many Christians\nnot only in Uganda but also in other parts of the world.\n\n36 Ben.
