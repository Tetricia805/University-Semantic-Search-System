The research examines how high fuel costs\ninfluence key performance indicators, including operational expenses, sales volume, profitability,\nand market share. A descriptive, cross‐sectional design was employed, with quantitative data\ncollected via structured questionnaires distributed to staff across departments within the company.\nFindings indicate that high fuel prices driven by geopolitical tensions, fluctuations in exchange\nrates and elevated taxation substantially increase operational costs, disrupt supply chains, and\nerode profitability and sales performance. Mitigation strategies such as efficient route planning,\nbulk purchasing, and cost-cutting measures are implemented but are largely reactive and\ninsufficient. The study recommends more proactive measures, including government tax incentives,\ninvestment in alternative energy sources, and enhanced contingency planning by organizations.\nThese insights are significant for policymakers and businesses in the oil, gas, and manufacturing\nsectors aiming to strengthen resilience against fuel price volatility.\n\nKeywords: fuel prices, organizational performance, operational costs, supply chain, mitigation\nstrategies\n\nXIV\n\nI\n\nCHAPTER ONE\nGENERAL INTRODUCTION\n\n1.1\nCHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION", "word_count": 244, "start_char": 12516, "end_char": 14327}

Fuel prices,\nwhich were already rising as global economies recovered from the Coronavirus pandemic, surged\nfurther after the Ukraine war pushed up oil prices. This surge caused inflation and economic\nhardship for many businesses and consumers. Some industries, such as transportation, were\nparticularly hard hit. Governments sought ways to mitigate rising fuel prices. Pump prices were\ndetermined by crude oil prices and the dollar exchange rate because crude oil was traded in dollars\n(IMF, 2022)).\nRussia, one of the world's major oil exporters, was targeted by economic and trade sanctions. After\nBrent crude oil, a global benchmark, hit a near 14-year high of $139 a barrel during the early\nstages of the conflict, prices fell back to around $100. However, prices rose again to $115 on\nTuesday, driven by the European Union discussing a ban on Russian oil purchases, which countries\nin the bloc depended on.\nCountries such as the US and Canada banned Russian oil imports. Petrol wholesale prices for\nretailers stood at £1.30 per liter for petrol and £1.48 for diesel. With high prices reducing retailers'\nmargins and 20% VAT being added, affordability for consumers became a major challenge. The ban\non Russian oil imports meant other suppliers had to take up the slack, often leading to higher\nprices due to reduced competition. This directly impacted the cost of petrol and diesel for\nretailers, who passed these costs to consumers. This strained consumers relying on cars for\n\n2 | P a g e", "word_count": 347, "start_char": 13980, "end_char": 16185}

Therefore, finding ways to reduce the cost of\npetrol and diesel was essential to ensure affordability.\nThe key concepts in this study were “high fuel prices,” the independent variable, and\n“performance of organizations,” the dependent variable. The study aimed to determine how high\nfuel prices affected organizations' performance by evaluating how fuel prices influenced\noperational costs, productivity, and other factors contributing to overall organizational\nperformance. \"High fuel prices\" referred to the amount of money a company spent on fuel to\nmaintain operations, while organizational performance referred to how well the company\nfunctioned despite high fuel prices.\nIn late 2021, most countries faced price dispersion caused by the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions.\nThe pandemic had pervasive and devastating effects on the performance of organizations,\nlifestyles, relationships, and livelihoods. Companies made difficult decisions, including cost-cutting\nmeasures to survive, leading to decreased demand for products and services in many sectors. This\ncaused reduced consumer spending and increased unemployment. The economic impact continued\nglobally. In May 2023, consumer spending, measured by credit card transactions, declined in real\nterms by over 6 percent compared to the previous year.\n\nThe current increase in oil demand was primarily due to the removal of COVID-19 quarantine and\nrestriction measures worldwide. This led to a sudden increase in transportation as people traveled\nmore for business and leisure. The manufacturing sector also ramped up production, further\nincreasing oil demand. Additionally, an oil price war erupted after disputes between Russia and the\nSaudi-led Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). OPEC sought to cut production to\nmatch reduced demand and the global economic downturn, while Russia refused cooperation\n(Peter Gale, October 27, 2020).\nRussia’s refusal to reduce production quotas undermined shale oil extraction in the United States.\nAccording to Rosneft, a Russian state-owned petroleum company, if Russia had accepted\nproduction cuts to maintain prices, American shale oil would have gained more market share,\nwhich would have been unfavorable for Russian oil. However, the failure of Saudi Arabia and Russia\nto agree on production cuts exacerbated the crisis (OPIS, 2020). Russia’s oil industry suffered\ngreatly from market instability, and the country’s economy was severely impacted by falling oil\nprices. Though Saudi Arabia and Russia later agreed to production cuts, the agreement came too\nlate to prevent damage to Russian oil producers.\n\n3 | P a g e", "word_count": 445, "start_char": 15885, "end_char": 18872}

Corporate objectives were the goals set by a company,\nwhich could be short-term or long-term and typically quantifiable. For example, a company may\naim to increase sales profit by 10% in the coming year, and sales performance would be evaluated\nbased on whether this target was met. Organizational performance on sales was based on\nunprocessed data comparing target sales figures with actual sales. It could also reflect customer\nloyalty; high customer loyalty often indicated strong sales performance (Leung & Law, 2019). Aksu\n& Tarcan (2019) suggested that performance was multi-faceted and influenced by diverse factors.\nClark (2018) introduced the marketing outcome construct to relate marketing practices to results.\nAccording to Minculete & Olar (2018), organizational sales performance could be evaluated through\nsales volume analysis, marketing cost analysis, and profitability analysis, typically by studying\nprofit and loss statements by product lines, territories, and key accounts. However, other factors\nsuch as employee satisfaction, customer satisfaction, and product or service quality were also\nimportant in evaluating performance and should not be overlooked.\nNile Plastics Company, located in Kampala city center, contributed significantly to the city’s tax\nbase and business activity. The company employed many local people, supporting the local\neconomy. It had been a major economic player in Kampala for over twenty years, with its success\nillustrating the city’s growth potential. Rapid urban growth continuously increased demand for its\nproducts, boosting revenue (Gou, 2022). The company was committed to community investment\nthrough job training and educational opportunities, fostering a positive working environment and a\nculture of innovation. Despite COVID-19 restrictions in 2020 affecting sales and production, the\ncompany remained operational and supported employees and the community financially during the\npandemic, demonstrating its dedication.\nThe company’s fuel suppliers since its launch in Kampala included: VIVO Energy (U) LTD – SHELL,\nTotal Nateete, HASS Nalukolongo, STABEX International Limited; Meru Petroleum Ndeeba, NILE\nEnergy Limited or GAZ – Rubaga, OIL Energy (U) Limited - Nateete. All suppliers were near the\nproduction center. The company sourced fuel locally, reflecting a commitment to the local\neconomy.\n1.3 Problem Statement\nThe transition to fully online models during the COVID-19 pandemic posed challenges for most\norganizations, as many employees were unprepared.

The outbreak of the Ukrainian war with Russia caused crude oil shortages and\ntriggered high fuel prices, which negatively impacted organizations by increasing transport and\nenergy costs, contributing to inflation (Guénette, Ken worthy, & Wheeler, 2022). To cover\nincreased operational costs, companies raised product prices, disproportionately affecting poor\nrural communities, who were the main consumers of many manufacturers.\nThere has been deterioration in terms of trade, a fall in purchasing power for firms, and declining\nhousehold living standards in Uganda. Many small factories risked closure due to increased input\ncosts. The long-term economic impact could be devastating, potentially leading to widespread\npoverty and reduced quality of life.\nWithout interventions, organizations faced challenges affecting financial performance, growth, and\nsustainability, including increased operational costs and supply chain disruptions. This report\nsuggested ways organizations could optimize operations, manage costs, and explore alternative\nstrategies. Collaborative efforts among governments, industries, and stakeholders were essential to\naddress these challenges effectively.\n\n1.4 Purpose of the Study\nThis study examined the impact of high fuel prices on organizations’ performance, using Nile\nEnergy Uganda Limited as a case study.\n1.5 Objectives of the Study\nTo identify the causes of high fuel prices.\nTo establish the relationship between high fuel prices and organizational performance.\nTo identify strategies to mitigate the effects of high fuel prices.\n\n1.6 Research Questions\n1.

The findings could identify areas for cost reduction, efficiency improvement,\nand process optimization, helping companies compete and survive during fuel price crises.\nThe findings may also benefit policymakers and government agencies focused on energy use by\noffering alternative strategies to address Uganda’s fuel price crisis, potentially reducing energy\ncosts and creating employment opportunities. Ugandan citizens might benefit through reduced\nenergy expenses.\nFuture researchers may build upon these findings, contributing to existing knowledge.

Political\nunrest, conflicts, or sanctions can interfere with operations and delay project completion. Shifts in\nsupply and demand influence how much market share organizations gain or lose. Economic trends\nsuch as inflation, recessions, or growth directly impact profitability and financial health. Taxes or\nsubsidies change operating costs or provide financial support, affecting budgets. Fluctuating fuel\nprices affect customer loyalty because they influence costs for organizations and consumers.\nChanges in exchange rates affect how quickly organizations can import or export goods, which in\nturn affects supply chain responsiveness. Finally, differences in transportation costs and local taxes\nacross regions impact how fast and efficiently goods are delivered. To measure performance, we\nuse indicators like how fast the supply chain responds, changes in market share, profit margins,\nfinancial constraints, customer retention, logistics efficiency, and how long projects take to\ncomplete. Each factor is expected to influence one or more of these indicators and together they\nform the backbone of our study’s framework.\n\nFigure 1 showing Conceptual Framework showing the relationship of high fuel price as independent\nvariable\nAgainst performance of organization\nHigh fuel price\n\nperformance of organizations\nIndependent Variables\n\nDependent Variables\n\n1.

Additionally, it discusses potential strategies to mitigate the impact of fuel prices\nand concludes with recommendations for further research.\n2.2 High Fuel Price\nOil prices affect industrial production through different channels. On the supply side, a rise in oil\nprices increases production costs and leads to a contraction in output; this contraction further\nincreases due to reduced investment (Brown and Yokel, 2002). On the demand side, increased\nproduction costs translate into higher product prices, causing aggregate productivity to fall (Hunt\net al., 2001). Another important channel is the wealth effect, transferring income from oilimporting to oil-exporting countries, reducing aggregate demand in oil-importing countries.\nAn increase in oil prices also increases demand for money; when monetary authorities cannot meet\nthis demand, interest rates rise, reducing economic growth (Brown and Yokel, 2002). Bernanke et\nal. (1997) acknowledged that the combination of tightening monetary policy and oil price shocks\ndepressed the real economy by discouraging investment.\nOther important determinants of organizational performance in industrial production include\nexchange rate, trade openness, foreign direct investment (FDI), interest rate, gross capital\nformation (GCF), and labor force. High fuel prices affect economic growth through import and\nexport channels. Export enhances economic growth by increasing competition and returns to scale,\nwhile import promotes growth by allowing economies to access advanced technologies (Krueger,\n1978).\nExchange rate fluctuations affect output levels: depreciation boosts the price of foreign goods\nrelative to domestic goods, increasing competitiveness and output (Dornbusch, 1988). However,\nsome studies argue depreciation raises input costs and reduces output in developing countries\n(Hirschman, 1949; Krugman, 1999).\n\nHistorically, high oil prices between the early 2000s and 2014 triggered many studies into the\neffects of fuel prices on organizations and households. Fuel price indicators often cover exposure\n(average fuel expenditure), sensitivity (income levels), and adaptive capacity (viability of\nalternatives to vehicle use). Accessibility to alternative transport modes reduces oil vulnerability\neven where car travel is high (Leung et al., 2015; 2018; Rendall et al., 2014).\n\n9 | P a g e\n\n2.3 Sales Performance\nSales refer to transactions where a buyer receives goods or services in exchange for money (Hutt &\nSpeh, 2018).

Sales effectiveness requires\ncollaboration between sales and marketing to improve knowledge, messaging, skills, and strategies\n(Aksoy, 2019). Sales efficiency involves identifying and automating weak sales processes (Kotler,\nKartajaya & Setiawan, 2017; Treace, 2012).\n2.4 Sales Volume\nSales volume is the core interest of any sales-based organization (Kotler & Keller, 2016). Positive\nsales growth indicates progress toward sales goals (Hsu & Tsou, 2017). The number of qualified\nleads and new sales opportunities critically influence sales management.\nAverage purchase value supports sales growth strategies, revenue projections, and forecasting.\nSales volume may be monitored by product or region (Aksu & Tarcan, 2019). Break-even sales\nvolume indicates the minimum sales needed to avoid loss.\n2.5 Market Share\nMarket share is the percentage of total sales a company generates over a period (Cop & Oyen,\n2018). It can be measured by value or volume. Higher market share indicates stronger consumer\npreference, lower selling effort, and higher profitability (Leung & Law, 2019). Increased market\nshare provides cost advantages and growth opportunities (McIntyre & Virzi, 2018).\n2.6 Profitability\nProfitability is a company’s ability to generate revenues exceeding sales expenses. Sales\nprofitability is evaluated through profit margins, indicating overall health and sales strategy\neffectiveness (Chaffey & Smith, 2019; Reid, Smith, & McCloskey, 2018). Analyzing profit margins\nguides decisions on promotions and commissions.\n2.7 Relationship between High Fuel Prices and Organizational Performance\n\n10 | P a g e\n\nThe manufacturing industry has faced disruption due to changing consumer habits, new\ncompetitors, and store consolidations.

In Uganda, increased operational costs caused\ndisruptions in trade, shortages of raw materials, and job losses, worsening poverty (Ministry of\nFinance, 2021).\nThe fuel crisis threatens Africa’s economic growth, with oil-importing countries potentially losing\nbillions in revenue and requiring substantial subsidies to manage costs. This may hinder progress on\nSustainable Development Goals and the Africa Agenda 2063.\nEmpirical studies show mixed effects of oil prices on industrial production in developing countries.\nWang and Zhang (2014) found significant impacts in China, while Ang et al. (2006) found\ninsignificant effects in Southeast Asia. Reyes and Quiros (2005) showed oil prices negatively\naffected stock returns and industrial production, with stronger effects on stock prices.\nNo panel data study has focused on Uganda’s industrial sector. This study aims to fill that gap by\nanalyzing Nile Plastics Limited using panel data, providing insights to guide policy and support the\nlocal economy.\n\n2.8 Strategies to Mitigate the Effects of High Fuel Prices\n\nOrganizations have increasingly adopted diverse strategies to reduce the adverse impacts of rising\nfuel costs on performance. One commonly applied approach is financial hedging and structured\nprocurement. Companies in fuel intensive sectors often use bulk purchasing, long-term supply\nagreements, or derivative contracts to stabilize cash flows and shield those onselves from price\nvolatility (Berghöfer, 2014; Barrachina Fernández, 2024). These strategies enhance predictability in\nbudgeting and investment, though they require financial expertise to manage effectively.\n\nAnother strategy involves operational optimization, particularly in logistics and distribution.\nEmpirical studies indicate that route optimization, load consolidation, and speed management\nsignificantly lower fuel use, with savings ranging from 3–10% across fleets (Ericsson, 2006; Taskar et\n\n11 | P a g e\n\nal., 2023). For manufacturing firms with delivery operations, such as Nile Plastics, these strategies\ncan reduce recurrent costs while improving service efficiency.\n\nTechnical measures such as energy efficient machinery and preventive maintenance also mitigate\nfuel cost pressures. Research highlights that firms adopting systematic maintenance programs and\nupgrading to energy-saving equipment realize both fuel cost reductions and productivity gains\n(Schmitt, 2025). These interventions often provide attractive returns on investment when fuel\nprices are high.", "word_count": 393, "start_char": 32001, "end_char": 34855}

In East\nAfrica, firms have increasingly integrated solar power into operations, adopted biomass for heat\nprocesses, and explored electrification of transport fleets. Case studies demonstrate that solar\nhybrid systems reduce dependence on diesel generators while offering long-term cost savings\ndespite high upfront capital requirements (Chisika et al., 2021; Gicha, 2024).\n\nFinally, organizations implement structural and policy-oriented strategies. Internally, lean\nmanufacturing and employee training on energy conservation reduce waste and promote efficient\nfuel use (Zhang, 2024). Externally, firms may lobby governments for subsidies or temporary tax\nrelief to cushion against volatile markets, particularly in developing economies where energy\naccess remains a constraint (World Bank, 2025; International Energy Agency [IEA], 2024).\nCollectively, these strategies strengthen organizational resilience and ensure business continuity in\nthe face of high fuel prices.\n\n2.9 Research Gap\nAlthough previous studies have examined the long-term effects of oil prices on industrial\nproduction in various countries, there has been no comprehensive panel data study focusing\nspecifically on Uganda’s manufacturing sector. Uganda’s unique economic, social, and policy\ncontext means that findings from other countries may not fully apply. The dynamic nature of fuel\nprice fluctuations and their direct impact on manufacturing performance in Uganda remain\nunderexplored.\nMoreover, this gap is significant in light of Uganda’s national campaign “Buy Uganda, Build Uganda”\n(BUBU), led by the Ugandan Manufacturers Association and supported by the Ministry of Finance.\n\n12 | P a g e\n\nThe BUBU initiative promotes local production and consumption to reduce import reliance and\nstimulate economic growth. Persistent high fuel prices threaten this campaign by increasing\nproduction and transport costs, raising prices of locally made goods, which affects affordability for\nfinal consumers and risks undermining the initiative’s goal of self-reliance.\nTherefore, understanding how high fuel prices affect organizational performance in Uganda’s\nmanufacturing sector is crucial. Addressing this gap will help identify strategies to mitigate fuel\nprice shocks, enabling industries to remain competitive and support the BUBU vision. This study\naims to provide empirical evidence to inform policymakers, manufacturers, and stakeholders on\nprotecting and sustaining Uganda’s industrial growth amid volatile fuel markets.\n\nCHAPTER THREE\n3.1 Introduction\nThis chapter presents the methodology used in the study, covering the research design, area of\nstudy, study population, sample size and selection, data collection methods, data collection\ninstruments, research procedure, data quality control, measurement of variables, ethical\n\n13 | P a g e", "word_count": 448, "start_char": 34458, "end_char": 37768}

This indicated that the\nworkforce at Nile Plastics Company Limited was largely composed of young to mid-aged adults.\nIn the context of the study, the age distribution was significant because it provided insight into\nhow employees of different age groups might perceive and respond to high fuel prices. Younger\nemployees (26–35 years), being the largest group, were likely more adaptable to operational\nadjustments or efficiency measures required to cope with fuel price fluctuations. Older employees\n(46–55 years), although fewer, may have had established work routines that could be more affected\nby rising fuel costs.

Future research could adopt a\ncomparative, multi company approach to determine whether the observed impacts and coping\nstrategies are consistent across different sectors of Uganda’s economy, such as transport, agroprocessing, or construction.\n\nSecond, the research focused mainly on short-term operational and financial strategies. As global\nenergy markets shift toward renewables, future studies should investigate the feasibility of\nrenewable energy adoption, hybrid systems, and electric mobility solutions as long-term mitigation\nstrategies for Ugandan manufacturers.\n\nThird, the study employed a cross-sectional design. To capture how firms adapt to prolonged fuel\nprice volatility, further research could use longitudinal methods that track performance and energy\nrelated investments over time. Such studies would reveal whether strategies remain sustainable\nunder changing market conditions.\nFourth, this study emphasized organizational strategies. Additional research is needed to explore\nthe role of government policy and regulatory frameworks in shaping firms’ ability to manage fuel\nprice shocks. Areas of interest include subsidies, taxation, and incentives for renewable energy\nadoption in Uganda and the broader East African region.\nFinally, future research could incorporate digital and technological innovations such as artificial\nintelligence in logistics, Internet of Things based energy monitoring, and advanced predictive\nanalytics for fuel demand. These emerging tools may transform how firms in developing economies\ncope with energy-related challenges.\nBy addressing these areas, future studies will enrich the body of knowledge on energy cost\nmanagement and provide policymakers and business leaders with evidence-based strategies to\nstrengthen resilience against high fuel prices.\n\n31 | P a g e", "word_count": 315, "start_char": 58341, "end_char": 60631}
