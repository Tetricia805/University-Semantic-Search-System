The major research gap under\ninvestigation was mainly the limited productivity of employees that is attributed to demotivation\nfrom employers especially In terms of unfavourable remuneration strategies, and thus, what is\ncausing poor remuneration standards at darling factory? In order to effectively answer the\nhighlighted research problem, the researcher employed the case study research design to examine\nthe data about the influence of remuneration on employee productivity. The case study research\ndesign was used as the most suitable research design mainly because the researcher needed\nadequate details about the problem of study and the time frame was limited. In so doing, the\nresearcher focused on the Darling factory employees as a specific case for the study and from\nwhich, generalisation about the findings of the case study would be made.\nThe research established that lack of job security in the private sector, low payments, bad\npayment schedule and the lack of equity between the amount of work done and payment were\nthe major bottlenecks that affected remuneration and thus resulted into low employee\nproductivity. Therefore, it was concluded that employee productivity and compensation have a\nsignificant relationship. That is to say, based on the findings of this study, compensation has a\ndirect effect on overall employee productivity. In doing so, some of the remuneration gaps that\nneeded to be addressed by employers included: a lack of employee motivation due to the absence\nof fringe and performance benefits; a lack of team building; a lack of job security; a poor\npayment schedule; and lower salaries paid to the employees.

Introduction\nThis chapter provides a general outline of the dissertation. This was a perfect reflection of the\nstudy's exact facts. Consequently, the section accurately depicts the research on the influence of\ncompensation on employee productivity. The chapter explored; the background of the study,\nproblem statement, purpose, goal, research objectives, and research questions, scope of the study,\njustification, significance and conceptual framework.\n1.2 Background of the Study\nThe issue of productivity had been further exacerbated by the constant debate about employee\ncompensation. Employee compensation issues have grown to be one of the biggest issues in the\nmodern era, especially when considered globally. The two objectives of compensation and\nproductivity, which both employers and employees must meet, are what adds more appeal to the\ndiscussion. The majority of affluent nations in Europe have placed a strong emphasis on assuring\nhigh levels of pay and labour productivity. The minimum wage rules and other labour laws,\nrights, and privileges have been particularly effective in achieving this.\nAn employee's output over a specific period of time can be used to evaluate productivity. The\nproductivity of a particular employee is typically evaluated in comparison to the average of\nemployees performing similar work. Paying workers well encourages them to work hard\n(Kirvan, 2013). Employees' standard of living is largely determined by their salaries, which are a\nsignificant source of income. Employee productivity and performance are impacted by salaries.\nTherefore, both management and employees have a lot riding on the amount and mode of\ncompensation.\nFor instance, Uganda was grappling with countless industrial actions staged by unsatisfied\nemployees in various sectors. With evidence from some of the employee strikes, the problem of\nremuneration in Uganda becomes easily traceable. The Uganda Medical Association called for a\n100-day strike in 2017 in protest of inadequate salary, lack of equipment and supplies, and the\nhiring of senior health officers (SHOs) and medical interns (JHOs) into the public service.

It goes without saying that the unmet demand in each case was an increase in\nphysician remuneration.\nThe major concern resonated around remuneration and thus, there is necessity for this research\nproject to provide a glance at some of the remuneration strategies. Scheduling and managing\ncompensation-related concerns across the organisation is dependent on the remuneration\nstrategy, also known as the compensation strategy, of a company. Based on a variety of factors,\nincluding the nature of the job and the position of the employee in the hierarchy, compensation\napproaches vary across industries and even within businesses.\nSome of the standardised remuneration strategies constitute: basic remuneration, performance\nbased incentives, profit sharing policy, nonfinancial remuneration, and sales commission\nstructure among others. In the basic remuneration strategy, the level of education, seniority, or\nskill can affect pay rates. Performance and compensation are not directly correlated with this\ntype of compensation. In terms of the performance based incentives compensation strategy, it is\nmore appropriate in some work environments to judge employees' performance and pay them\naccording to the outcomes. Merit pay, contingent pay, and piece rate pay are a few illustrations\nof performance-based incentives (Dan, 2013).\nOn the other note, the profit sharing policy involved employees being encouraged to take into\naccount the overall objectives and performance of the organisation by a profit sharing policy at a\ncompany. Earnings from profit sharing can take the form of cash, company stock, stock options,\nor stock appreciation rights. Other remuneration strategies are nonfinancial remuneration that\nentailed incentives for achievement, an accommodating workplace, and chances for promotion,\ninvolvement of staff in decision-making, bonuses, and additional benefits (Ibid, 2013). Whereas\nthe sales commission structure is where a significant number of businesses offer commission to\nsalespeople as a proportion of the selling price of the good or service. In essence, this encouraged\nthe salesperson to concentrate on promoting the priciest goods in order to receive the highest\ncommission.\nIf favourable payment levels to employees are not well enhanced and thus, the economic crisis in\nUganda makes additional strikes likely, according to Bukenya (2022).

PHM Uganda is requesting that all health workers receive adequate\ncompensation in order to recognise the contributions made by them and prevent situations in\nwhich the quality of care is questioned.\nFailure to meet the salary demands became a continuous phenomenon in the Uganda labour\nmarket. The problem of poor compensation of employees has been clearly witnessed through the\nvarious strikes by different categories of employees. For example, science teachers’ strike, arts\nteachers’ strike, local government workers’ strike, Health workers’ strike and laboratory\ntechnicians’ strike in Uganda. Macho, a member of parliament for the Busia Municipality,\nclaimed that the differences in teachers' pay have undermined their morale and, as a result,\nlowered educational performance (The Independent, August, 2022).\nThe concern on salary enhancement had not been fully addressed in Uganda and still remains a\nhuge problem in the labour market. For instance, A Private Member's Bill on the minimum wage\nwas written by MP Arinaitwe Rwakajara in 2013 with permission from Parliament. Among the\nmany ideas made in his Bill was the minimum wage, which he proposed be set at Shs250, 000\nper month. Trade unionists at the time claimed that this would safeguard employees from\nexploitation (Monitor, 2021).\n1.3 Research Problem\nThe underlying gap was mainly the limited productivity of employees that were attributed to\ndemotivation from employers especially In terms of unfavourable remuneration strategies. The\navailable evidence showed that poor performance in various spheres of work is attributed to bad\nremuneration. The outcry was much louder through various trade organisations in Uganda\namong which, included the UNATU, UMA and so forth. These claim that, employees are not\nperforming to the expectation because of low/poor wages (Barigaba, 2022). Consequently poor\nservice delivery in the key service sectors of the economy especially health, education and public\nservice were very bad because of poor payment of their respective employees (Muhima, 2022).\nThus, the issue at hand showed that bad remuneration accounts for the general undesirable low\nproductivity levels of employees.", "word_count": 395, "start_char": 18552, "end_char": 21185}

These endless strikes had been purported on the ground\nthat, poor remuneration caused bad performance among the employees (Olukya, 2021). This is\nthe main reason as to why there was generally very poor service delivery in most of the sectors\nof the economy. That was to mean, poor remuneration demotivates employees from performing\nto the expected level. In a straightforward manner, poor payment was the root cause of low\nemployee productivity. Therefore, what was causing poor remuneration standards at darling\nfactory?\n1.4 Research Goal\nThe purpose of this study was to examine the influence of compensation systems on employee\nproductivity. As a result, the major goal of this research was to provide a comprehensive solution\nto conundrum of employee compensation and productivity.\n1.5 Research Objectives\n1.

We mainly focused on information or data about remuneration’s\ndetermination of the employee productivity levels.\n1.7.2 Time Scope\nWhen it came to time scope, the research strictly studied its problem with a specific timeline of\n4 months (semester duration) for easy information manageability and effectiveness in obtaining\nresults. Therefore, the research’s timeline was five years with specific time boundaries for easy\nmanagement, accuracy and sufficiency.\n1.7.3 Geographical Scope\nWhereas under the geographical scope, we focused on Darling Uganda limited located at\nNamanve Industrial area. Namanve industrial park located in Kampala Uganda along the\nKampala Jinja highway. Namanve Darling was the central production plant and was one of the\nmost labour intensive manufacturers and highest employer in Uganda.\n1.8 Justification\nThe limited focused on the employee remuneration situation especially in the private sector made\nthis academic research highly necessary. It was unfair to look at remuneration and employee\nmotivation in terms of public sector alone. Rather, there was need to also consider the plight of\nworkers in the private sector. This made the research on The Influence of Remuneration on\nEmployee Productivity Levels, highly necessary and valid with a specific consideration of the\nprivate sector employees.\n1.9 Significance\nThis research helped future researchers to gain deeper and concrete understanding of the problem\nof remuneration and its influence on employee productivity.

It provided ideal evidence upon which policy makers can base their\nrecommendations when drafting policies to solve employment problems in Uganda.\nThe research findings therein, would help in solving labour related problems especially those that\nare attributed to remuneration. This would directly benefit employers and employees in terms of\nproviding independent and researched authority about the best remedies to adopt in the labour\nmarket. Therefore, this would be an ideal tool for curbing industrial actions in Uganda by\nproviding pragmatic solution to both remuneration and employment gaps in Uganda.\n1.10 Study limitations\nThe research was limited by case study research design which narrowed down its focus to a\nsmaller group. This might limit the accuracy of findings and the generalisation of results and\nconclusions might become quite difficult to accomplish. The research might be threatened by the\nindividual biases of the researcher and this might compromise the accuracy of findings about the\nproblem of study.\nHowever, the researcher will ensure effective minimisation of the likelihood of these outlined\nlimitations. This will be especially by digging adequate details using the case study design so as\nto get concrete evidence that is fit and easy to generalise as a general phenomenon. For the case\nof individual bias infiltrations, calibration of data collection tools with unknown letters and the\nuse of simple random selection of the population sample will aid in getting rid of individual\nbiases of the researcher.\n1.11 Theoretical/Conceptual Framework\nThe enhancement of salary will provide a motivation factor to employees and result into high\nproductivity levels at work. According to Smith, the demand for labour can only rise in direct\nproportion to the growth in the amount of money set aside for paying wages (Kleinsorge et al,\n2023). Thus, a rise in capital would lead to a rise in the demand for labour.

Thus, there is\nneed to increase salaries of employees to improve their productivity levels.\nDiagram 1: The Conceptual Framework Diagram\nIndependent Variable Dependent Variable\n\nIntervening Variables\n\nSource: Arabian Journal of Business and Management Review (Nigerian Chapter)\nRemuneration\nHigh salary\nAllowances\nLife insurance\nMinimum wage payment\nPerformance bonuses\nEmployee Productivity\nRevenue per employee\nAbsenteeism rate\nQuantity of output\n\nOther external factors\nEconomic situation\nLabour union influence\nLabour market\nPolitical influence\nCapital\n\nVol. 4, No. 2, 2017", "word_count": 187, "start_char": 26668, "end_char": 27946}

It will\nbe taken into consideration how compensation affected employee productivity according to\nstudies, research undertakings, and other earlier surveys. As a result, it would be carried out\nchronologically in accordance with the specific research objectives, which include looking at\nsome wage disparities, identifying the reasons behind low employee productivity, and assessing\nthe effect of compensation on employee productivity. As a result, we would be better able to\ncomprehend the issue under inquiry in this study.\n2.2 Examining Some of the Remuneration Gaps\nAccording to some findings, segregation in remuneration especially based on gender of\nemployees is one of the commonest remuneration gaps today (UN Report, 2022). For instance,\nbased on new research released on Wednesday by two UN organisations, the gender pay gap in\nthe health and care industry is about 25% worse than it is in other economic sectors (ILO Report,\n2022). In order to reduce gender wage discrepancies, an increasing number of governments have\nproposed transparency measures and information exchange during the past few years. Recent\nstudies have shown that depending on how they are implemented, pay transparency measures can\nefficiently reveal compensation disparities and lessen more general gender inequities in the\nlabour market (Ibid, 2022).\nMore details on the gender remuneration gap problem, are channelled towards society’s\nprejudices against women in the labour market. Since women's labour is undervalued and they\nare more likely to work in occupations with lower concentrations of women than men, there is a\npersisting disparity in average pay between men and women that exists in all nations and across", "word_count": 280, "start_char": 27946, "end_char": 29785}

Even if the labour itself may involve just as much or even more skill\nand effort, it is less appreciated and paid for.\nDifferent from the previous arguments, other survey results purport that Fair pay must be a major\ntopic of discussion during negotiations at the national, sectorial, regional, and enterprise levels.\nThis will stop societal unrest and unplanned labour disputes. Raphael Pils made notice of the\nnecessity of enhancing the social partnership role, ensuring adequate compensation, taking into\naccount the needs of employees, and overseeing the practical application of the stipulated\nminimum wage.\nAnother research account suggest that, poor preconceptions and bad perceptions about certain\nprofessions or sectors in the economy is responsible for all the remuneration gaps in the labour\nmarket. For instance, Agriculture, forestry and fishing, fine art, leisure real estate transactions are\namong the professions with the lowest pay. The extent of the average income disparity by\nindustry, profession, and position is substantial (ILO, 2021). Jobs in the most vital\nsocioeconomic sectors like agriculture, education, and health care are undervalued. Adequate\nminimum wages and the subsistence minimum must be established in order to close the wage\ngap. In order to fairly redistribute income between extremely profitable and unprofitable sectors,\nit is important to implement certain processes.\nContrary to the above, other research findings point out the impracticability of the modern\nremuneration trend. For instance, According to a 2016 Stanford University Public Perception\nSurvey on chief executive salary, 74% of Americans think that CEOs are paid too much in\ncomparison to the average worker (Summerfield, 2020). Only 16 percent of respondents think\nCEOs are compensated fairly. Although opinions on CEO remuneration differ across\ndemographic groups, the general consensus is still highly unfavourable. Over the past ten years,\nthe public and the media's perceptions of inequality and the gap between workers and senior\nexecutives have become more entrenched (Ibid, 2020). There is extensive reporting on the gap\nbetween top executives and the general workforce today.\nI brief, the concern of remuneration has been persistent mainly because the employers regard\npayment of workers as a burden. The management of salaries is by far the most complicated\nissue faced by companies. This is a source of delight and happiness as well as frustration. (Dinca,", "word_count": 437, "start_char": 29417, "end_char": 32292}

(Dinca,\n\n2021). Although not the sole factor affecting our work lives, remuneration is very important\n(otherwise more people would choose non-paid work). Companies' perception of wage as an\nexpense (up to 70% of their cost base in some cases) hinders their efforts to compensate workers\nfor their abilities and performance while also pursuing profitability (11% is the average profit in\na listed business). This causes tension (Ibid, 2021).\n2.3 Finding out the Causes of Low Employee Productivity\nAccording to some studies, Poor productivity at your place of business can have an impact on\nprofit margins, efficiency, and staff morale. Sadly, a number of internal problems that have\nerupted and now require your immediate attention frequently led to poor levels of productivity\n(Quain, 2018). You, as the company's owner, are in charge of creating the ideal organisational\nstructure and culture. Understanding the causes of low levels of productivity at any firm is the\nfirst step in resolving the problem. Finally, management can create the strategies required to\ninspire a low-productivity employee and restore order to your company's operations.\nOther survey findings have established three major causes of low levels of employ productivity\nwhich include; employee training gap, Management and supervision that are ineffective and Poor\nOrganisation Structure (Onyenkwelu, 2020).\nEmployee Training Gap: Lack of sufficient training for employees was frequently the cause of\nlow productivity at the workplace. Insufficient education or training was frequently to blame\nwhen your employees are unable to perform to the levels required to meet significant project\nmilestones. When employees were adequately trained, they might work independently without\ndirect supervision, which were not the case when they make mistakes or take a long time to\ncomplete simple jobs. Due to the requirement for higher-performing employees to rectify the\nerrors of the less experienced workers, there will be a drop in productivity at work as a result of\ntheir inability to finish their work on time.\nOther major causes of low levels of employee productivity was the Management and supervision\nthat are ineffective. Managers that lack the ability to inspire workers and maintain high\nperformance standards might lead to low productivity at work. Incompetent management is\nfrequently characterised by poor communication, excessive micromanagement that made staff\nmembers hesitant to make even the most fundamental decisions without permission, and the", "word_count": 426, "start_char": 32010, "end_char": 34815}

Frequently, a low-productive employee will\nprovide you the cues you need to assess your management. Your task was to speak with that\nemployee to ascertain whether your management are giving them the freedom they need to work\nto the levels that are necessary for achievement.\n\nPoor Organisation Structure was the third most cited cause of low levels of employee\nproductivity. In certain cases, a very low productivity employee was the victim of a management\nstructure that does not maximise the people's skills and talents. For instance, the survey picked a\ndemonstration where one operates a content writing company, and coming up with new content\nideas for the clients were critical to providing high-quality work and staying productive. Thus, In\nthat case, one may need to restructure company business to a horizontal organization, in which\nthe authors develop content ideas that were evaluated by everyone before they are authorised.\nThrough implementing this modification, it now enabled the authors to take ownership of their\nmaterial and drive them to boost productivity since they are more enthusiastic about what they\nare composing.\nContrary to the above arguments, other research findings provide social concerns as the major\nbarriers to better employee productivity. That was to mean, personal problems such as Child care\nchallenges, marital problems, loss and bereavement, illness or accident, and life transitions can\nall led to poor performance and attendance. Our workplace regulations and management styles\nmay not allowed employees to take the necessary time to address issues or provide the necessary\nsupport (ERC, 2011). We generally find that if we provide our employees with the tools and\nresources to manage their personal lived more flexibly, such as generous leave, flexible\nscheduling, employee assistance programmes, and supportive management, they can properly\nmanage their individual affairs and performance on the job.\nAccording to Demings (2023), the systemic challenges are the major contributors to low levels\nof employee productivity. The thinking of Deming was supported by recent research. Critical\nworkplace issues, like leaders failing to implement strategy within organisations, threats to\nemployee mental health and well-being, and a lack of belonging and inclusion, are primarily", "word_count": 403, "start_char": 34481, "end_char": 37180}

It\ndoes not consider social needs or job satisfaction, in contrast to more contemporary theories of\nworkplace management. A specialisation of labour, centralised leadership and decision-making,\nand profit maximisation are instead promoted by classical management theory (Villanova\nUniversity, 2022). Thus, this management theory first emerged in the late 19th century and rose\nto prominence in the first half of the 20th century. Its sole purpose is to streamline operations,\nboost productivity, and improve the bottom line.\nFrom another academic perspective, Adam Smith as traced from his treatise on the “Wealth of\nNations” centralises the value of labour on the type of output it produces. The amount of labour\nthat can be exchanged for a possession ultimately determines its value (Divyansh, 2020). Any\ngood should be worth the same to buyers as the amount of labour it allowed him to obtain or\ncommand. Therefore, the true indicator of the exchangeable value of all commodities was labour.\nThe subsistence wage theory states that labour wages should be kept to a minimum. The return to\nlabour was mandated by the subsistence wage theory.\n2.4 Establishing the remuneration strategies to improve employee productivity\nIn view of Kyprianou (2022) argument, it was clearly suggested that among any company's\nprimary objectives should be to figure out how to increase employee productivity. Operational\neffectiveness was given a lot of attention because it can determine a company's success or\nfailure. But there were many other ways to motivate your employees to be more productive, so it\nisn't just a matter of approving significant pay raises.\nSlightly opposed the above claim, Symonds (2022) argues that a compensation strategy entailed\nmuch more than merely giving your staff a salary that complied with FLSA regulations, such as\nminimum wage and overtime pay. You must also provide extra benefits like healthcare, wellness\ninitiatives, and retirement planned in order to remain competitive as an employer in a cutthroat\nindustry. In other word, the overall game plan for company operations includes a compensation\nstrategy.

It involves choosing where\nyou want to compete, how competitive you must be, and how you would compensate the\nemployees. In other words, what policies you need to put in place to fairly compensate the staff\nso they stay with the company (Ibid, 2022).\n\nAccording to some studies, Employee dissatisfaction may result from improper compensation\nmanagement, which was regarded as a complex process requiring accuracy and precision.\nAdditionally, it aids in the establishment of job standards that are pertinent, practical, and\nquantifiable by the organisations. Thus, an employee's compensation was one of the primary\nfactors that drived them to perform better. In light of this, management in the civil service should\nbe examining the compensation that its workers receive. This is because updated pay scales help\nincentivize employees to perform better at their places of employment to some extent (Maxwell,\n2008). Employee performance is impacted by environmental working conditions.\nOther research have made fact findings on the relationship between remuneration and employee\nperformance. It was therefore discovered that, although it was not always compensation-based,\nremuneration can encourage workers to be more productive. Remuneration can also refer to\nadulation or acceptance. However, compensatory payment, like a raise or promotion, can be\neffective in fostering long-term motivation and productivity (Richason, 2021). Hence,\nRemuneration was a technique for enhancing morale, boosting urge, and fostering team cohesion\nwhich all result into good employee performance.\nIn total contrast to the previous claims, other findings confirm that remuneration alone was not\nenough to improve employee performance, rather, motivation was another key component that\nshould be considered. According to incentive theory, giving employees bonuses and additional\nbenefits can boost both employee and business performance. This theory contends that if\nmanagers and staff are promised extra resources and other perks, they will work harder and more\ndiligently (Salamah, 2017). Additionally, according to Aziz and Naid (2010), an incentive\npayment can boost employee engagement, loyalty, organisational productivity, and interpersonal", "word_count": 383, "start_char": 39341, "end_char": 41991}

In order to effectively improve their productivity, employees may be motivated by\nincentives.\nAnother section of researchers have established that, employee performance is unaffected by\ncompensation. As a result, receiving more money does not motivate people to perform better\n(Chin-Sang et al, 2014). Additionally, businesses must take into account the fairness principle\nwhen implementing compensation. Employee performance, meanwhile, was significantly\ninfluenced by motivation. As a result, increased motivation will result in better performance.\nImplementing a human resources development policy is one way to increase employee\nperformance. Thus, one element that has the power to enhance performance is motivation. Selfdevelopment, training, and culture are just a few of the processes that can generate motivation.\nOther proponent positions purport that remuneration especially in accompaniment of other\nincentives, fuels employee performance/productivity. Advanced performance was generally\ncorrelated with greater worker negative consequence, according to compensation theories, or it\ninvolves more notable effort (Adewale et al, 2014). These theories assume the existence of\ncompensation structures that align employee normal functionality with observed profit growth in\norder to encourage the development of such systems (Akter et al, 2016). These incentives can\ncome in a variety of forms, such as praise from upper management and lower management,\nglances at potential promotion opportunities in the future, assurances derived from notable\naccomplishment and recognition, and present and future monetary incentives linked to\nperformance.\nA more divergent discovery was made by Malthus who was greatly opposed to motivation of\nemployees through remuneration. In his findings, Malthus suggested that, He argued that all\nsalaries, rents, and profits must be considered as the foundation for exchange. Due to population\npressures, labour returns were at a subsistence level. Malthus completely ignores increases in\nworker pay because it will only encourage them to have more children (Divyansh, 2020). This\nimplies that there is no relationship at all between compensation and worker productivity.\n2.5 The Research Gap\nThe arguments presented throughout the entire literature review exercise clearly portray the fact\nthat employee compensation has been a source of ongoing conflict in the labour market.

This\nexplanation explains why there are so many strikes, especially in developing nations like Uganda\nwhere employee compensation was still a major problem. The majority of owners of production\nfactors view wages as a liability that injures their margins of profitability. As a result, there was a\npoor and regrettable culture of underpaying employees, who are seen as an opportunity cost in\nthe production process. Therefore, it was essential that we promote the relationship between\ncompensation and employee productivity.\n\n2.6 Conclusion\nTherefore, it can be said that compensation was a major factor that affected how productive\nemployees were and how well they perform overall. The root of all competition on the labour\nmarket was unquestionably compensation, which has been clearly established. The supporters\nand opponents of the existence of a link between pay and worker productivity represent a variety\nof viewpoints. The provision of poor services, particularly in the case of public services, has\nbeen further linked to poor pay and pay practises. Poor pay for employees were primarily to\nblame for this, as it demotivated them and leads them to skip out on assignments and\noccasionally solicit token payments from clients.

As a result, this was a description of how the researcher gathered information\nfrom the field and addressed the specific research questions. The various components of this\nexercise, included the research design, study population, sampling technique, sample size\nestimation, data sources, data collection tools, data quality control, analysis plan, and ethical\nconsiderations involved in the entire field exercise, were all methodically demonstrated.\n3.2 Research Design\nThis research exclusively employed the case study research design to examine the data about the\ninfluence of remuneration on employee productivity. The case study research design was used as\nthe most suitable research design mainly because the researcher needed adequate details about\nthe problem of study and the time frame was limited. In so doing, the researcher focused on the\nDarling factory employees as a specific case for the study and from which, generalisation about\nthe findings of the case study were made. This directly implied that, especially by way of\nassumption, the findings from this particular case of examination, were scientifically fit and valid\nresults about the general conclusion regarding the correlation between remuneration and\nemployee productivity.\nBy way of execution, the case study research design, as opposed to most broad statistical\nsurveys, enabled the researcher to exceptionally focus on a specific situation in depth.

Thus, the\nresearcher ensured that all of the data gathered was pertinent and this was crucial when designing\nthe case study. She will also planned and designed how to address the study. In contrast to a\nscientific report, there were no set guidelines, so the most crucial aspect lied in ensuring that the\nstudy was focused and direct to the point; otherwise, it would have require the researcher to sieve\nthrough a lot of irrelevant data.\n3.3 Population of Study\nBoth part-time and full-time employees of the Darling factory were the subject of the study. The\nfact that virtually every worker at the factory was eligible for the investigation, it enabled the\nresearcher to gather reliable data from the field. As a result, the study took into account all of the\nworkers at the Darling factory, including those who were casual, technical, skilled, formally and\ninformally employed on the factory's production line.\n3.4 Sampling Technique\nThe researcher employed two sampling techniques; the simple random sampling and the\nstratified sampling techniques. The simple random sampling technique involved random\nselection of the employees to constitute the sample. This approach was also known as a method\nof chances. That was to mean, the members were selected by way of probability and thus, all\nworkers in Darling factory had equal chances of being selected to be included in the population\nsample. Given the large target population, simple random sampling technique was the most\nsuitable sampling technique to be used to obtain a bias free sample for the study.\nThus, each employee of the Darling factory essentially had an equal chance of being selected for\nthe sample in a simple random sampling. Simple random sampling was the best sampling\nmethod because it eliminated bias from the selection process and produced representative\nsamples, according to the theory supporting it. And as such, simple random sampling was the\nbest option among random sampling techniques because was more representative of the sample\ngroup and left less room for researcher bias than non-random sampling methods.\nSecondly, the researcher also used the stratified sampling technique mainly because the targeted\npopulation was too large. To make the field survey easier, the stratified sampling involved", "word_count": 422, "start_char": 47450, "end_char": 50105}

Therefore, the researcher ensured that\nthe targeted population was very well represented.\n3.5 Sample Size Determination\nThe researcher estimated the needed population sample for the study and used Slovin's method\nof sample size determination. For social science research projects in particular, this method of\ndetermining sample size was the best choice. Since the Slovin method correlated with simple\nrandom sampling techniques and was most useful in situations where the study's population was\nsizable, employed it to calculate the sample size.\nTo achieve the required sample size for the study, the study specifically operated at a 95% level\nof confidence, a 5% confidence interval, and a 0.05 margin of error. According to field statistics,\nDarling was estimated to employ 9900 people altogether, however, for purposes of convenience\nand feasibility, the general target population was 50 employees. Thus, the sample size would be\ndetermined as follows:\nn =N/ (1 + Ne2)\nn = 50/ (1+50*0.052)\nn = 50/ 1.125\nn = 45 Darling employees (respondents).\nTherefore, the population sample comprised 45 employees of Darling factory.\nTable 1: Showing sample size of population\nCATEGORY OF RESPONDENT\n\nSAMPLE SIZE\nMETHODS OF SAMPLING\nCasual Female employees\n\nSimple random sampling\nCasual Male employees\n\nSimple random sampling\nSkilled employees\n\nStratified sampling\nSupervisors\n\nStratified sampling\n\nTotal\n45 employees at Darling factory", "word_count": 280, "start_char": 49702, "end_char": 51592}

As a result, the investigation used a combination of data from first hand\nand secondary sources.\n3.6.1 Primary data Sources\nThe primary data was exclusively obtained from the 45 respondents. Thus, the population sample\nwas the primary source of data for the study especially in alignment with the responses obtained\nfrom the field at darling factory during data collection.\n3.6.2 Secondary Data Sources\nThe secondary data will be gathered from the Darling factory's human resource reports on\nworker productivity and individual employee performance reports. The report of Workers' MP\non the status of employees in Uganda will provide more detailed second-hand information.\n3.7 Data Collection Tools\nGiven the nature of the problem being investigated, the researcher predominantly used two data\ncollection tools: questionnaires and interviews. The researcher was compelled to use both\nquestionnaire and interview data collection tools, as was illustrated below, due to the research\ndesign that was chosen, the general mixture of employee categories, and the need for detailed\ninformation about the influence of remuneration on employee productivity.\n\n3.7.1 Questionnaire\nVery well-designed questionnaires were used for the study, which included likert scale questions\nas well as open-ended and closed-ended questions. It implied that 45 employee respondents at\nthe Darling factory received questionnaires to be completed by 45 participants in order to collect\ndata. Additionally, a research assistant was needed to assist with the translation of the questions\nfor the illiterate and casual workers who were not fluent in English.", "word_count": 313, "start_char": 51213, "end_char": 53359}

As\nlittle more than a consequence, questionnaires were a common method of data collection in such\nsituations. These tools were excellent for gathering data, especially for figuring out how\nemployees behaved, what they preferred, what they intended to do, how they felt about it, and\nhow it affected their performance in general and their ability to work productively at Darling\nfactory.\n3.7.2 Interview\nThe process of gathering data also included interviews. The researcher conducted one-on-one or\nface-to-face interaction sessions with the key focal persons, particularly the Darling factory\nsupervisors, and were scheduled one at a time. Therefore, the researcher had direct physical\ncontact with the focal individuals she had strategically selected, all of whom had sufficient\nknowledge of how compensation affected employee productivity.\nIn contrast to other research methods, the interview in this case allowed the researcher to gather\nthorough data and made more in-depth conclusions about the connection between compensation\nand worker productivity. The researcher needed to use interviews in the field when gathering\ndata at the Darling factory because they enabled in-depth questioning and thorough examination.\n3.8 Data Quality Control\nThe researcher paid close attention to the type of feedback received from the field, particularly\nfrom Darling employees. To ensure consistency, the answers were cross-checked against the\nquestions. This suggested that the researcher gathered the necessary data from the field, crosschecked the answers especially those from the questionnaires for mistakes, and guaranteed the\nresponses' logical flow.\nAdditional quality control measures were implemented, such as screened responses, simplified\nsurvey language, and excluded respondents who were already biased.

The\nresearcher used standardised procedures and protocols to record field observations and data,\nalong with well-defined guidelines for items like interview question structure.\nData editing, cleaning, and verification against the logical flow of the questions, as well as crosschecking and validation, were also a focus of the data verification. She authenticated the entries\nagain afterwards.\n3.9 Data Analysis Plan\nIn the plan for data analysis, key important aspects were systematically observed and followed.\nBoth qualitative and quantitative approaches were predominantly employed when performing\ndata analysis. Therefore, it also involved identifying key responses and using the qualitative data\nto explore recurring themes. Based on the employees of the Darling factory's field responses,\nqualitative data was analysed. The study used a standard analysis method for its quantitative\nanalysis, which involved interpreting the data it had already collected. This was because the\nproposed study design (a case study design) was largely descriptive, the researcher sought to\nlearn more about the impact of compensation on employee productivity.\nIn light of the evidence that was gathered from the field, the data analysis specifically addressed\nthe research questions. To address the study's initial assumption, it was accomplished by looking\nat, classifying, tallying, and integrating qualitative and quantitative evidence from various\nsources. Following that, the analysis and discussion were carried out and evidence from primary\nand secondary sources was associated through examination and comparison in relation to the\nobjectives of the study.\n3.10 Ethical Considerations\nThe researcher requested ethical approval from the School of Business of Uganda Christian\nUniversity through the academic supervisor before she headed out into the field to conduct the\ndata collection exercise. This was authorised by an introductory letter that was given to the\nappropriate authorities at the Darling factory, and permission to carry out the exercise was\nrequested from the pertinent officers in charge there. Each employee that took part in the data\ncollection exercise also gave the researcher their free and informed consent.", "word_count": 390, "start_char": 55198, "end_char": 57939}

In other\nwords, the researcher kept employees’ personal information private and made sure that\nrespondents' anonymity was upheld. In so doing, she made sure that the respondents' identities\nwere protected and that their names were never mentioned. Instead, we'll use imaginary names\nlike respondent Z, F, O, and so forth. Additionally, the responses from the employees was only\nused for this study's specific purpose and was not used for any other non-academic purposes.\n3.11 Anticipated Methodological Constraints\nSince there was likelihood of worry about losing their jobs, the respondent would not have willed\nto provide the necessary information. It might been challenging to travel because of natural\nhazards like heavy rain. Given that the majority of employees would be preoccupied with\nrunning the factory's production lines, there would not have been enough time to conduct a\nthorough investigation. Some employees would have given responses according to the influence\nand persuasion of their co-workers at the Darling factory.\n3.12 Solutions to the Methodological Constraints\nThrough asking deceptive questions, the researcher used responsible methods to gather private\nand sensitive information from the workers. Planning was done in a sufficient and timely manner\nto prevent interruptions due to inclement weather. To save time while gathering data in the field,\na straightforward random sampling technique was used. In order to give employees timely\naccess, the data collection process was properly scheduled.\n\nCHAPTER FOUR\nPRESENTATION, ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION\n4.1 Introduction\nThe chapter comprised the presentation, analysis and discussion of the field findings about the\nproblem of study. That was to mean, the chapter comprised fact findings about the influence of\nremuneration on employee productivity levels.\n4.2 Background Characteristics of Respondents\nTo examine the background characteristics of the respondents, the researcher mainly analysed\nthe bio data of the respective respondents in alignment with the designed data collection tool.\nThis comprised, gender, education level, nature of employment and terms of employment of the\ninterviewed respondents.\nFigure 2: Gender of Respondents\nGENDER CATEGORY\nFrequency %\nFemales\nMales\nTOTAL\n\nThe study comprised 64% female and 36% male respondents respectively.

Thus, there was a significant correlation between education level and nature\nof employment.\nTable 3: Terms of Employment\nTerms of Employment\nFrequency\n%\nPermanent\nHire/Temporal\nContract\nTOTAL\n\nThe findings in Table 3 showed that 43 (96%) of the interviewed employees were under\nhire/temporal and only 2 (4%) had contract employment terms.\nIn brief, the background characteristics clearly show that, the factory employs labour intensive\nmeans of production whereby majority of the employees are unskilled. This has had a direct\nimpact on the nature of work category of work done by the employee at the factory.\n4.3 To Examine Some of the Remuneration Gaps at Darling\nUnder this objective, the researcher looked at some of the commonest prevailing challenges that\nhinder remuneration of employees. That is, some considered gaps included; lack of bargaining\npower, gender, and time of payment, level of experience, payment schedule, job insecurity and\namount of compensation.\n\nTable 4: Identifying the major Remuneration Gaps at darling\nn=45 Respondents\nQUESTIONS\nYES %\nNO\n%\nTOTAL\nMy salary is paid on time?\nI am satisfied with the schedule of payment?\nDoes my gender determine the amount of my\nsalary?\nDoes my experience influence the amount of my\nsalary?\nDo I bargain for the amount of compensation to\nearn?\nIs the amount of compensation equivalent to my\nwork done?", "word_count": 342, "start_char": 60210, "end_char": 62411}

Thus it was factually established by the researcher that, gender category\ndoes not determine the amount and terms of remuneration.\nWhen critically evaluated, the field findings about the objective on remuneration gaps at darling,\nit can be inferred that there are mainly 3 remuneration gaps faced by employees and these\nincluded; lack of job security, less amounts of remuneration and bad/poor schedule of payment.\nFigure 3: The Identified Remuneration Gaps from the Respondents\nIDENTIFIED REMUNERATION\nGAPS\nYES\n%\nNO\n%\nTOTAL\nIS the amount of compensation equivalent\nto my work done?\nI am satisfied with the schedule of\npayment?", "word_count": 277, "start_char": 62150, "end_char": 63914}

This is mainly\nbecause most prior studies had established gender as the major remuneration gap. On the\ncontrary, the present findings prove that gender is not the major concern of remuneration. Rather,\njob insecurity, unfavourable payment schedule and little amounts of salaries are to blame.\n4.4 To Find out The Causes of Low Employee Productivity.\nIn order to discover the main cause of employee productivity, the researcher considered the\ncommonest issues as based on the literature review. These included: meeting work targets, time\nframe, relations at work, and motivation factors like benefits, and performance bonuses.\nTable 5: The Major Causes of Low Employee Productivity\nn= 45 Respondents\nQuestion\nYES\n%\nNO\n%\nTOTAL\nI meet the given work targets?\nI observe the given time frame?\nThere is relationship amongst employees\nThere is relationship between employees and\nsupervisors\nMy supervisors complain about my performance\nI am paid some performance bonuses?", "word_count": 278, "start_char": 63703, "end_char": 65520}

This is premised on the field evidence that, the majority\n30 (67%) of the interviewed employees were not in position to meet their given work targets.\nThe identified major causes of low employee productivity included; low motivation spirits\nrepresented by the lack of performance bonuses and lack of performance benefits. Other causes\nare poor work relations especially between the supervisors and employees as well as amongst the\nemployees themselves.\nIn a critical assessment of the above results, it can be deduced that the major causes of low\nemployee productivity as obtained from the field are; lack of motivation to workers especially in\nthe form of other benefits and performance rewards, poor relations at work amongst employees\nthemselves and between their supervisors,\n4.5 To Establish the Remuneration Strategies to Improve Employee Productivity\nIn the process of examining the above stated objective, the researcher focused on some key\napplicable strategies that would be employed to leverage employee productivity and these were;\nattending to employees’ complaints and grievances, performance indicators and team building\nstrategies.\nTable 6: Strategies Put in Place to Improve Employee Productivity\nn = 45 Respondents\nQuestion\nYES\n%\nNO\n%\nTOTAL\nHave efforts been put in place to improve your\nperformance?\nThere are employee performance indicators put\nin place?\nThere is a mechanism for settling my\ncomplaints", "word_count": 304, "start_char": 65182, "end_char": 67152}

That was to mean, more challenges are still persistent\nespecially the lack of team building and absence of a clearly defined employee performance\nindicator\nWith reference to the results as obtained from the field, it was therefore worth concluding that,\nthere were evident strategies put in place to uphold employee productivity though not effective\nenough to bring about the desired results.", "word_count": 202, "start_char": 66877, "end_char": 68154}

That was,\nthe summary of findings was presented according to the specific research objectives and seeks to\ndemonstrate how the research questions have been answered by the researcher. In other words,\nthe main factors limiting employee productivity were the identified pay gaps, job insecurity,\nlower pay, and unfavourable payment schedule.\nThe analysis from the field indicates that the above-mentioned pay gaps were unavoidable\nmainly because the majority of employees were temporary workers without contracts, making\njob losses, salary limitations, and unfavourable payment schedules obvious challenges. When\nthe field findings regarding the objective on pay disparities at Darling are critically assessed, it\ncan be deduced that there were primarily 3 pay disparities that employees must contend with.\nThese are: a lack of job security, lower pay, and a bad or subpar payment schedule.\nAccording to findings from the field, the main reasons for low employee productivity include:\npoor working relationships between employees and their supervisors, lack of motivation for\nworkers, especially in the form of other benefits and performance rewards.\nThe majority of employees have low productivity as a result of poor pay, which is characterised\nby a lack of bonuses for performance and fringe benefits. As a result, it was found that the\nmajority of employees are not motivated to work and instead simply carry out their tasks without\nsetting any goals to be met because they are in a serious state of discouragement.\n\nAs a result, it was important to draw the conclusion that, despite the strategies that have been\nimplemented to maintain employee productivity, they were not sufficient to achieve the desired\noutcomes. Corresponding to this, the majority of businesses have made an effort to ensure that\nemployees work in a pleasant environment by establishing complaint procedures and monitoring\ntheir handling of employee conflicts.

In other words, employees are prioritised because they were thought of as the main\nfactor input, the labour force.\n5.2 Conclusion\nConclusively, the study has practically illustrated that there was a significant relationship\nbetween remuneration and employee productivity. That was to imply, according to the results of\nthis research, there was a direct impact of remuneration on the general employee productivity. In\nso doing, some of the identified remuneration gaps that need to be addressed by employers\nincluded; lack of employee motivation due to the absence of fringe and performance benefits, the\nabsence of team building, lack of job security, poor payment schedule and less amounts of\nsalaries given to the employees. In other words, there is a significant correlation between\nremuneration and employee productivity. Therefore, the research results clearly suggest that,\nimprovement in remuneration to the satisfactory of the workers will result into improved\nperformance of employees at work.\n5.3 Recommendation\nThere was need for labour intensive companies such Darling Uganda limited to establish to\nensure that employees were given precedence by improving the job security of employees in the\nprivate sector because if the labour force was compromised the whole production was affected.\nThus, satisfaction of employees will help to leverage productivity of the company and also raise\nthe profitability levels of the company.\nThe research suggest the need for employers to adjust in their remuneration systems from the\ntraditional salary compensation, and also incorporate other compensation strategies. That is,\ncompanies should have a multifaceted remuneration system that includes alongside salaries the\nfringe benefits like allowances, and performance bonuses.\nNotably, that there was also need for on-board training to be extended to the employees. This\nwas because majority of the employees were unskilled who required practical on-job training\nsuch that their productivity levels can be improved upon.", "word_count": 357, "start_char": 70027, "end_char": 72430}
