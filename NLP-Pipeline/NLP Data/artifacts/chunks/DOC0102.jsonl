There has\nbeen a positive response in harnessing the technology of plants to clean wastewater.\nImproperly treated domestic wastewater is quite harmful to the environment. Scientists\nare intricately studying this approach and the realization is its cost effectiveness,\necofriendly attributes and ability for it to run with no need for energy. The major aim\nof this specific study is to investigate how effectively Water Lettuce remove nutrients,\nand BOD from secondary treated wastewater. It put a test the polishing abilities of\ndomestic wastewater. Treatment was executed in two troughs, one tub without the\nwater lettuce was taken as the control unit and the second labeled the treatment unit\nthat had the water lettuce. The troughs were of dimensions 0.7m× 0.5m× 0.3m. The\nsewage samples were assessed for three pollutants, T.N, T.P and BOD. After 10 days,\nthe results were impressive from the treatment, they showed that water lettuce\nremoved 80.93% and 77.90% removal efficiency of T.P and T.N respectively. After 15\ndays. Because the effluent from the treatment unit met the discharge standards for\nT.N, T.P and BOD5 it was safe to be released into the environment.\nThis study focused on optimizing the existing infrastructure in a to meet the present\ndemands in a cost effective and environmentally sustainable manner.\n\nii\n\nDECLARATION\nI, PRECIOUS MIREMBE, hereby declare that this is my original work, is not plagiarized and\nhas not been submitted to any other institution for any award.\nPRECIOUS MIREMBE\nS1932B/295\nSignature: ............................................

Wastewater\ntreatment is important for the reduction of contaminants and pollutants of natural\nwater sources. The quality of water in these bodies is significantly affected by the\ndischarge of poorly treated wastewater effluent into these bodies from the different\ninstitutional wastewater treatment plants.\nThe high energy demands of WWTP have emerged as a significant financial burden,\nimpacting their overall economic viability (Li, 2017). This highlights the need for\nexploring more energy efficient treatment processes to minimize operational costs.\nLarge scale, conventional sewage treatment plants can have significant carbon\nfootprint. An average carbon footprint of 0.78kg CO2 equivalent per cubic meter was\ndiscovered by a study conducted in India (Singh et al., 2016). As a response to this\npredicament, many countries are embracing low cost environmentally friendly\ntechnologies. An example is using aquatic plants in the phytoremediation process for\ntreatment of wastewater.\nWastewater Stabilization Ponds Technology is another one of the most convenient and\nvastly growing treatment methods for developing countries (where using the\nconventional method is costly) (Belay D, 2022). Because of the nature of processes this\nmode of treatment entails, it’s even more favorable for countries in the tropical region\n(regions characterized by consistently mild to warm weather throughout the year).

These plants are outfitted with mechanisms for adsorption and\ntranslocation of nutrients from the environment. The plants are harvested and can be\ndeposited in various ways for example, vermicomposting done with the help of worms\nproducing a nutrient rich compost suitable for gardening (Lumbricus rubellus and red\nwigglers) (The Worm Composting Company, 2023)\nMeeting treatment and effluent discharge standards has proven to be a significant\nchallenge, particularly in developing countries where there is deficiency of technology\nand qualified personnel (Letshwenyo W., 2018). In developing world, waste stabilization\npond (WSP) has been widely used especially where land is abundant, and climate is\nfavorable especially temperature and sunlight. Uganda is one of the countries in the\ntropical Region that uses Wastewater Stabilization as a treatment method for domestic\nwaste water. However, many of these systems have been performing below the\nrequired standards (Letshwenyo W., 2018). The causes are inadequate operation and\nmaintenance practices, and the buildup of sludge in the ponds among many other\nfactors (Letshwenyo W., 2018). Effluent water samples were analysed for; Phosphate\nmean concentration levels (NEMA-5mg/l) Phosphate mean concentration levels; NO3\nwas 10 mg/l; NH4 concentration was 385.33 mg/l (NEMA -10MG/l); Colour 1627.67 TCUs\n(NEMA – 50 TCU); Turbidity – 186.63NTUs (NEMA).", "word_count": 272, "start_char": 15519, "end_char": 17420}

Limited maintenance budgets restrict proper desludging, allowing sludge to\naccumulate over time. This coincides with a growing population in Mbarara, placing a\ncontinuously increasing burden on the wastewater treatment system's capacity.\nDespite desludging efforts in June 2023, the sludge problem persists, indicating a\npotential need for alternative or more frequent management strategies.\nThe consequences of this situation are severe. They include environmental\nconsequences; water pollution from the high organic content in the wastewater\neffluent, algal blooms due to increased nutrient levels in water bodies (River Rwizi\nwhere the effluent is deposited), the foul smell radiating from the waste stabilization\nponds, public health concerns include disease outbreaks for example, typhoid\ndysentery; health risks from pollutants for example, digestive issues. Ineffectively\ntreated wastewater poses a significant threat of environmental contamination.\nUntreated or inadequately treated wastewater can harbor harmful pathogens,\njeopardizing public health in the surrounding communities. This situation necessitates\na prompt and effective solution to safeguard public health, environmental quality, and\nthe long-term sustainability of the wastewater treatment system.\n\n1.3 OBJECTIVES FOR STUDY\n1.3.1 MAIN OBJECTIVE\n❖ To investigate the use of water lettuce in removal of nutrients from wastewater\nat Kakoba Treatment Plant.\n1.3.2 SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES\n1.

Despite desludging of the ponds, the effluent from\nthe ponds does not meet the discharge standards which is detrimental to the\nenvironment.\nSince Water Lettuce is famous for its phytoremediation ability, it has the ability to\nbreak down pollutants like BOD and reduction of nutrients in wastewater through its\ndifferent parts (roots and leaves). The cumulative effort of the invasive plant\ncontributes enhancing the treatment process in the maturation pond. It provides an\nadditional attribute of breaking down BOD.\nWater lettuce also has the likelihood for accumulating the nutrients it takes up (Khater\nand Ali, 2022). This stored biomass is then harvested and prospectively employed as a\nfertilizer hence fulfilling the objective of sustainability through resource recovery.\nAquatic plants are simple in operation, low maintenance and low cost in operation and\nare self-sustaining. They are suited for the atmosphere given they thrive most in\ntropical climates which describes the climate of Kakoba.\nThey provide a technology favorable for the limited budgets given that solely depend\non natural processes for nutrient uptake and BOD reduction (removal of pollutants).\nThis is in sync with the goal of probing low-energy and conceivably low-cost alternatives\nfor supplementing unconventional wastewater treatment processes. The systems of\naquatic plants can also operate at higher loading rates.", "word_count": 272, "start_char": 19392, "end_char": 21187}

It simply means water that is not clean\nbecause it has been used in households, factories, runoff from farms, and others.\nWastewater is polluted water, and its pollutants are from both point sources and\ndispersed sources(R L and Mehta, 2020). It is dangerous to the environment when\nreleased without treatment.\nPoint sources: this simply means a single identifiable source of pollution for example\ndrain or a pipe (usually industrial wastewater effluent being discharged by a pipe into\na river)\nDispersed/ non-point sources: Also known as diffuse pollution simply mean inputs that\nhappen over a large/ wide area and can be zeroed down to one source. They are usually\nattributed to a specific land use for example urban land use, Agricultural land use and\nfactory land use and others. Diffuse pollution is executed by agents like storm water\nthat greatly impact the water quality of the different waterways they flow into (EPA,\n2021).\nWastewater from the different sources affects the quality of surface and ground water\nthis is as a result detrimental to human health and the health of the environment at\nlarge(Madhav et al., 2019). Therefore, wastewater management and treatment are a\nconcern for the globe, and is also a key factor of the water cycle.", "word_count": 294, "start_char": 20791, "end_char": 22643}

It's considered highly contaminated with pathogens and\nbacteria that can cause illness. Black water can also contain harmful gases like methane\nand hydrogen sulfide, which can be dangerous in high quantities.\nThe various technologies for the consumption and or reuse of waste water effluent\ninclude macrophyte pond, aquaculture, irrigation, discharge for recharge to a water\nbody or ground water (Elizabeth T., 2014). The technologies involved in generating\nblack water include, pour flush toilets, Dry Cleansing materials, cistern flush toilets.\nThe blackwater generated by the users connects to the semi-centralized treatment\namenity by a (gravity) simpler sewer network.\nNational Water and Sewerage Corporation the body incharge of treatment of\nwastewater in Uganda employs two major ways of treatment of wastewater. These\ninclude,\n• Conventional treatment methods: involve a combination of both physical,\nchemical and biological processes to degrade and remove solid particles and\nother harmful substances from sewage.\n• Non-conventional methods employ biological processes to remove harmful\nsubstances from the sewage. These mainly take place in stabilization ponds.\n2.3 WASTEWATER PARAMETERS\nThese refer to the measurable characteristics of wastewater that help determine the\nquality of wastewater before it is discharged to the environment.

They sometimes depend on\nthe source of generation.\nThe Physical parameters include color, odor and temperature, suspended solids with\nregards to the current makeup of the environment we focus on the main parameters of\nwastewater. These are BOD, Total Nitrogen, Total Phosphorous, Heavy metals, Total\nSuspended Solids, Chemical Oxygen Demand (Alumichem, 2023). These parameters\nmust be reduced and controlled before the wastewater eluent is released into the\nenvironment. They are explained as below.\n2.3.1 Colour\nColour in wastewater is mainly from municipal contamination and industrial impurities\nof iron and manganese and other corrosive products. Organic matter present in water\nis usually associated with humus, minerals and other materials which are natural\nimpurities and corrosive products.\nThe variability of color within the sample for the sewage effluents in Kakoba was still\nvery low (CV; 14.67%). The mean color of the sewage effluents was (1627.67 ̊C).\nHowever, the color (TCUs) of the sewage effluents were higher than the EPA (20 - 150),\nNWSC, 500 [16] and NEMA (300) standards. (Atwebembeire, 2019). Colour does not vary\nduring the wet or dry season because the runoffs from the rain does not affect the\neffluent because the water is piped directly to the treatment plant.\n2.3.2 Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)\nBOD refers to the amount of dissolved oxygen needed by aerobic biological organisms\nto break down the organic material present in the water over a period of 5 days at a", "word_count": 278, "start_char": 23898, "end_char": 25699}

It measures the amount\nof organic contamination in the water (the organics that can be biologically oxidized).\nHigh BOD levels lead to decrease of oxygen in receiving water bodies hence death of\naquatic life. physical, chemical, and biological methods are employed to cater for\nremoval of this parameter.\n2.3.3 Nitrates\nNitrates is a form of nitrogen and vital nutrient for growth, reproduction, and survival\nfor organisms. Nitrate is a very important parameter because it estimates the organic\npollution in a particular area, and it represents the highest oxidized form of nitrogen.\nNitrate is one of the very common contaminants in the ground and surface waters.\nNitrates occur naturally in source water because of decaying plants. Agricultural\nsources of nitrates include livestock waste matter and chemical fertilizers. Nitrate\nconcentrations exhibited extremely very high variability within samples of Kakoba\n(122.47%) sewage effluents and mean values of (10 mg/l) effluents. The mean NO3 levels\nwere higher than the NWSC maximum permissible limit (5 mg/l) but below the EPA\nstandard (50 mg/l) (Atwebembeire, 2019).\n2.3.4 Total Phosphorous (Total-P)\nTotal phosphorous refers to the measure of all the phosphorous in the wastewater both\nin particulate form and soluble form.

In some instances, they could be\ndesigned to work as single units or configured in a series for enhanced treatment\nefficiency of the wastewater (Souza, 2019).\nWSP offers a remarkable approach for treating wastewater in an environmentally\nfriendly way. The treated wastewater, called effluent, can be reused for various\npurposes like irrigation, fish farming (aquaculture), and overall water conservation.\nThis benefits the environment and public health. However, reusing the effluent isn't\nalways possible. It can only be reused if it meets specific quality standards.\nIn cases where effluent is to be used for irrigation fish pond fertilization, only the\nAnaerobic and Facultative ponds are needed (Coldebella et al., 2017). These are also\nonly employed if weak sewage is to be purified before discharge to recharge the surface\nwater sources (Kayombo S., 2018). Many countries have strict regulations due to the\npotential presence of harmful organisms (pathogens) in the treated water.\nThis is especially true for unrestricted irrigation of raw vegetables like cabbage and\nspinach. Therefore, whoever operates the system must closely monitor the biological\n\nand chemical components within the treatment process. This ensures the treated water\nmeets the required standards and regulations.\nThree distinct pond types are connected. They are categorized as, anaerobic,\nfacultative, and maturation/ polishing pond. They are employed in the WSP system\neach with unique design characteristics that optimize the biological Treatment process\noccurring within.\n2.4.1.1 Anaerobic Pond\nThese ponds are suited to receive and treat waste water that is highly organically\nloaded that is, the Volumetric loading >100G BOD/m3. day that is equivalent to\n>3000kg/ha. day for a 3m depth) (Kayombo S., 2018).\nVolumetric loading is a very fundamental aspect of designing these ponds and is given\nby Equation 2.1,\nλv= LiQ\nVa\n⁄", "word_count": 428, "start_char": 31079, "end_char": 33950}

This helps sustain the anaerobic environment (Meiring et al., 1998)\n(Kayombo S., 2018).\nThese ponds luck dissolved oxygen and algae, this creates an environment suitable for\nanaerobic bacteria (Kayombo S., 2018). These bacteria break down organic matter into\n\nsimpler compounds while releasing methane and Carbon dioxide (Kadlec, 2009). This\ndone by sedimentation of solids and as a result anaerobic digestion (most pronounced\nat 15°C). This then is the birth of sludge in the anaerobic pond (Kayombo S., 2018).\nIt is important to neutralize acidic wastewater since the anaerobic bacteria is affected\nby a pH <6.2. An efficiently designed anaerobic pond can remove 40% of Organic Matter\nat 10°C but this efficiently jumps to 60% at 20°C (McCarty, 2011; Lettinga, 1995).\nThis pond typically functions as a deep (2-5 meters) entirely anaerobic environment\nthat reduces solids and BOD. The residence time of the waste water within this pond is\nquite short, ranging from 1 to 7 days. HRT is calculated on the formular given in\nEquation 2.2 below;\nta= Va\nQ\nEquation 2.2\nThe specific design parameters which include depth and detention time are determined\nbased on the characteristics of the influent wastewater, specifically the organic\nloading.\nAnaerobic bacteria thrive in this pond and this process effectively removes up to 60%\nof the BOD from wastewater. Due to their ability to handle high organic loads, anaerobic\nponds are well suited for treating strong wastewaters (Elizabeth T., 2014).

The bacteria in this pond find this zone ideal because they\ncan take advantage of both aerobic and fermentation pathways to further decompose\nthe organic material (Vymazal, 2015).\nThe Synergistic relationship between aerobic and anaerobic communities within the\nfacultative pond facilitates significant reductions in BOD- up to 75%. Detention times\nwithin the FP are strategically controlled falling between 5 – 30 days ensuring time for\nwastewater treatment by both aerobic and anaerobic conditions.\n2.4.1.3 Maturation Pond\nThey are commonly known as Finishing or Polishing Ponds (Elizabeth T., 2014). It is the\nfinal step in the treatment process of WSP systems. these ponds are designed to be\nultimately aerobic. They promote the growth of aerobic bacteria that further degrade\norganic matter and eliminate pathogens through different mechanisms (Arias, 2014).\nThese ponds are the shallowest component within the WSP constructed with depths\nranging from 0.5 – 1.5 meters (Vymazal, 2009). This strategic design ensures that\nsunlight penetrates the full depth of the pond, maximizing the photic zone for algal\nphotosynthesis (Arias, 2014). As algae undergo photosynthesis during daylight hours,\nthey produce DO a crucial resource for aerobic bacteria residing within the pond.\nHowever, DO levels naturally fluctuate throughout the day, reaching peak\nconcentrations during sunlight-driven photosynthesis and declining at night due to the\nabsence of this process (Vymazal, 2015).", "word_count": 343, "start_char": 36131, "end_char": 38353}

When combined with algae and fish harvesting\ntechniques, these ponds demonstrate remarkable capacity to remove significant\nportion of remaining nitrogen and phosphorous hence minimized discharge of these\npollutants into the environment (Vymazal, 2015).MP are majorly designed for Removal\nof Pathogens.\nThese ponds have a liner which bar leaching. The line could be compacted earth\nasphalt, clay, or any other material. A protective bar is constructed around the pond’s\nperimeter to using the excavated material during pond construction (Vymazal, 2009).\nThis term physically bars, effectively intercepts and diverts runoff away from the pond,\nhence minimizing potential for erosion along the shoreline (Arias, 2014).

This includes parameters such as length, width, depth, and surface area. The\ngeometry of a pond plays a crucial role in determining its hydraulic efficiency, retention\ntime, and treatment performance. Different geometrical configurations, such as\nrectangular, circular, or irregular shapes, can impact factors such as flow patterns,\nsedimentation efficiency, and mixing characteristics within the pond.\n2.4.2.3 Sludge Accumulation Assessment\nSludge accumulation assessment involves the measurement and evaluation of the\nbuildup of organic and inorganic solids (sludge) within wastewater treatment ponds\nover time (Mahassen M., 2018).

These chemicals include, dyes, acids\nand others. Some of these could drastically affect the physiochemical properties\nof the water making it dangerous for the microbes.\n2.4.3.2 Operational Factors\n• Hydraulic Retention Time (HRT): The amount of time wastewater spends in the\npond system is crucial (Anggarini et al., 2015). A longer HRT allows for more\ncomplete treatment by providing more time for natural processes to occur.\nFactors like pond depth and flow rate influence HRT.\n\n• Organic Loading Rate: This simply means the amount of organic matter entering\nthe pond system per unit of surface area (Orhorhoro and Sadjere, 2018).\nOverloading the ponds with organic matter can overwhelm the natural treatment\nprocesses, leading to inefficient removal of pollutants (Mahapatra, Samal and\nDash, 2022).\n• Pond Design: Factors like depth of the ponds, configuration (series of ponds can\nbe more efficient), and the presence of baffles (flow directors) can all influence\ntreatment efficiency. For instance, proper depth allows for stratification, where\nsettlement and biological processes occur at different zones within the pond.\nFor the deeper layers, Anaerobic digestion of organic matter and aerobic\ndigestion for the shallower zones that have oxygen from diffusion in the water\ncolumn (US Environmental Protection Agency, 1983).\nHRT= V\nQ\nEquation 2.5\n\nWhere;\nHRT – Hydraulic Retention Time (Days)\nV – Volume of the wastewater treatment pond (cubic meters)\nQ – Influent inflow entering the pond (cubic meters per day)\n2.4.3.3 Environmental Factors\n• Temperature:", "word_count": 426, "start_char": 40973, "end_char": 43897}

J., 2019).\n• pH: The optimal pH range for the microorganisms in WSPs is slightly alkaline (pH\n7-8). Deviations from this range can affect treatment efficiency by impacting\nmicrobial growth and multiplication (Hanif M. A., 2016). Hence digestion of\norganic matter present in the wastewater is affected.\n2.4.3.4 Monitoring and Maintenance\n• Regular monitoring of factors like influent and effluent quality, pond depth, and\nsludge accumulation is essential to maintain optimal performance. Early\ndetection of issues allows for timely adjustments to operational parameters\n(Hanif M. A., 2016).\n• Periodic desludging to remove excess settled solids is crucial to prevent pond\ncapacity reduction and potential short-circuiting of flow within the system,\nwhere wastewater bypasses treatment stages (Orr S. J., 2019).\n\nBy understanding and managing these factors, operator's optimization of the efficiency\nof wastewater treatment in stabilization ponds, ensuring proper effluent quality and\nenvironmental protection is possible.\nTable 2.2: Characteristics of the Main Pond System.\nCHARACTERISTICS OF MAIN POND SYTEM\nGeneral Criteria\nSpecific Parameter\nAP - FP\nFP - MP AP - MP - FP\n% Removal Efficiency\nBOD\n75-85\n75-85\n80-85\nCOD\n65-80\n65-85\n70-83\nT.

Some species, like water hyacinth (Eichhornia\ncrassipes), boast air-filled bladders on their petioles (leaf stalks) that provide\nexceptional buoyancy (Sánchez, 2001).\nWater Lettuce has tiny hairs underneath its leaves that hold bubbles of air forming a\nbasket-like structure that keeps the plants floating on the water surface. Others, such\nas certain duckweed species (Lemna spp.), have developed lightweight and spongy\ntissues that keep them afloat (Xu, 2016).\nThese adaptations are crucial for maximizing sunlight access, a critical factor for\nphotosynthesis since light intensity diminishes rapidly as it penetrates the water column\n(Duarte, 2016).\n2.5.2 Nutrient Acquisition Strategies\nSince they lack a connection to bottom sediments, floating macrophytes have\ndeveloped alternative strategies for nutrient uptake. Many species possess specialized\nstructures on their leaves or stems, like trichomes, that efficiently absorb dissolved\nnutrients directly from the water column (Lesiv, Polishchuk and Antonyak, 2020).

They provide a crucial food\n\nsource and refuge for a diverse range of aquatic organisms, including fish,\ninvertebrates, and amphibians (Duarte, 2016).\nAdditionally, these plants act as natural biofilters, filtering out pollutants and excess\nnutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus through their tissues and associated microbial\ncommunities (Xu, 2016). Their presence at the water surface also helps regulate water\ntemperature by providing shade, which can be particularly important for maintaining\nsuitable habitat conditions for temperature-sensitive species (Boyce, 2010). Such\nspecies include;\n• Salmonoids; these are fish that belong to the salmonoid family for example trout,\nsalmon and char. Even minor temperature increase beyond their optimum range\ncould disrupt their growth rates and spawning cycles.\n• Macroinvertebrates; Specifically, mayflies (Ephemeroptera). These are aquatic\ninsects which are sensitive water indicators of water quality and some of them\nhave very specific water temperature requirements for their different stages of\nlife (Lenat, 1986).\n• Amphibians; They depend on external sources for body heat regulation and are\nvulnerable in extreme temperatures (Blaustein A., 2010).

Dense mats of these plants can significantly block sunlight\npenetration, potentially leading to oxygen depletion in the water body (Les D., 2012).\nThis significantly disrupt the delicate balance of the ecosystem and harms other aquatic\norganisms.\nAdditionally, excessive growth can obstruct navigation and recreational activities on\nthe waterbody (Gopal, 2005). Effective management strategies are crucial to maintain\na healthy balance of floating macrophytes in aquatic ecosystems (Les D., 2012).\nTechniques include;\n• mechanical harvesting.\n• Controlled introduction of herbivorous fish\n• Manipulation of water levels\n2.6 Sustainable Management and Research\nAs the focus on ecosystem preservation and sustainable freshwater management\nintensifies, the ecological roles and functions of floating macrophytes are garnering\nincreasing attention (Duarte, 2016). Recent research delves deeper into the potential\nof these plants to mitigate climate change impacts, particularly their capacity of carbon\nsequestration and nutrient recycling within fresh water ecosystems (Hanson P., 2023).\nWith an increased understanding of these macrophytes, management strategies that\nonly ensure their continued ecological merits but also address the challenges associated\nwith their unlimited growth are addressed (Xu X., 2021).\n\n2.7 PHYTOREMEDIATION\nPhytoremediation is a process that harnesses the natural ability of plants to directly\nabsorb nutrients and accumulate pollutants within their biomass during growth (Feng,\n2014). It is a general terminology for the various technologies that plants employ to\ntreat soils, water and sludge contaminated with organic and inorganic contaminants\n(Nivetha C., 2016). Unconventional wastewater treatment systems in this integrate\nfloating microphytes have emerged as a promising approach to wastewater treatment\nand resource recovery, promoting sustainability and cost-effectiveness (Arias, 2014).\nThese systems mimic natural processes, achieving waste stabilization and nutrient\nremoval through mechanisms similar to conventional methods like activated sludge and\ntrickling filters (Vymazal, 2009). While physical sedimentation and bacterial activity\nare crucial aspects, aquatic plants offer an additional treatment pathway through\nphytoremediation (Vymazal, 2015). Following harvest, this biomass can be further\nutilized or disposed of responsibly.\n2.7.1 Characteristics of aquatic plants;\n• Higher tolerance to a large range of temperatures\n• High rate of growth in wetlands.\n2.7.2 Macrophytes\nAre species which grow in water.

Its root structure facilitates the uptake of excess nitrogen (as nitrates)\nand phosphorus (as phosphates), both of which can contribute to eutrophication and\nundesirable algal blooms. The specific mechanisms underlying this nutrient uptake\nlikely involve a combination of active transport processes mediated by membrane\nproteins and passive diffusion driven by concentration gradients.

Fish species utilize these underwater havens for spawning and hiding\nfrom predators. Invertebrates like insects and amphibians also benefit from the\nstructural complexity offered by the roots.\nLight Attenuation and Thermal Regulation: By forming a dense surface cover, water\nlettuce acts as a natural shade provider. This shading effect reduces light penetration\ninto the water column, mitigating excessive solar radiation for sensitive aquatic\norganisms. Additionally, the shade helps regulate water temperature, potentially\ncreating cooler microclimates within the water body.\nSediment Stabilization and Erosion Control: The extensive root network of water\nlettuce functions as a biological anchor (up-to 24 inches deep), binding and stabilizing\nbottom sediments. This root matrix also dampens wave action near shorelines, reducing\nerosion and protecting the integrity of the aquatic environment.\n2.7.4 Growing water lettuce happens best under three conditions\n❖ Suitable Environment:\nThe water body, pond or container should be positioned in a way that it is constantly\nexposed to sufficient sunlight exposure and a warm temperature exceeding 15°C", "word_count": 269, "start_char": 53520, "end_char": 55466}

Water Lettuce\nrequires at least six hours of direct sunlight daily.\n❖ Gentle Introduction:\nThe plants thrive most on water surfaces that have little agitation. This is because they\nare floating plants whose roots grow up to 24 inches deep. Therefore, intense surface\nagitation is a stumbling block for their proper growth and optimal multiplication. It is\nimportant to Carefully place the water lettuce on the water surface. The plants\nnaturally float, with their roots dangling freely in the water.\n2.7.4.1 Water lettuce in pond\nTo ensure water lettuce thrives and flourishes, several key factors require attention:\nthey are as follows\n• Abundant sunshine is essential for water lettuce. When positioning the pond,\naim for 6-8 hours of direct sunlight per day.\n• This tropical plant thrives in warmth. Ideal water temperatures range from\n20-30°C (68-86°F).

Here's an exploration of its potential applications:\nComposting: A straightforward approach, water lettuce can be composted alone or cocomposted\nwith\nother\norganic\nsubstrates\nto\ngenerate\nnutrient-rich\nsoil\namendments(HASSAN et al., 2023).\nAnaerobic Digestion: In large-scale operations, water lettuce can be utilized as a\nfeedstock for biogas production through anaerobic digestion. This process yields\nmethane, a renewable energy source, along with digestate, a nutrient-rich byproduct\nwith fertilizer potential.\nLivestock Feedstock (with Caution): Water lettuce offers some nutritional value and\ncan be incorporated as a supplementary feed for swine, rabbits, or aquaculture(Shi et\nal., 2022). However, its low protein content and presence of oxalic acid necessitate\ncareful dietary management and consultation with animal nutritionists to avoid\npotential health risks.\n\nVermicomposting: Water lettuce can be employed as a substrate for vermicomposting\nsystems(Cong et al., 2022).

The study\ninvestigated the potential of water lettuce (Pistia stratiotes L.) to enhance treatment\nefficiency in the maturation pond at Kakoba Waste stabilization Ponds. Baseline\nconditions were established by both assessing secondary and collection and analysis of\nprimary data. Water lettuce was introduced and monitored. By comparing postimplementation effluent quality to baseline data, treatment performance was\nassessed. Finally, Cost effectiveness of this approach was assessed.\n3.2 Determining baseline conditions of removal rates of BOD, TN and TP in the\nexisting maturation pond.\n3.2.1 Assessment of Secondary data.\nThis study benefited from data provided by National Water and Sewage Corporation\n(NWSC) about the design considerations, treatment methods currently used, historical\nproblems and anomalies or occurrences and operational challenges, Pond dimensions\n(depth, area and size) of Kakoba WSP, Appendix B-3 and Appendix B-4.

The Data clearly stated\nthe Quality of raw sewage and the final effluent over a period of 25 moths, Appendix\nB-6 and Appendix B-7.\nThis data covered the tests that had been carried out period before during and after\nde-sludging was done. Before that the ponds had not been de-slugged in over 9 years.\nFrom this data it was observed that station Infleunt and effluent caliber were assessed\nand the study was inclined more to organic traits of the wastewater. These were mainly\nportrayed by BOD. Among others, parameters like T.P and T.N were assessed.\n3.3 Primary Data\nTo ascertain the existing removal efficiency of Kakoba Waste Stabilization Ponds, a\nstudy was conducted to determine the current removal rates of BOD, TN and Total\nPhosphorous.\n3.3.1 Sample Collection\nClean plastic samples were labelled and rinsed with distilled water and then used for\nthe sampling process. They were labelled Raw Sewage, Anaerobic Pond, Facultative\nPond and maturation pond. Grab samples of waste water were collected from 4 key\nsampling points to say, inlet to the primary the inlet and out let of the primary\nfacultative pond, the outlet of the first maturation pond and the outlet of the second\nmaturation/polishing pond, Figure A-4. This ascertained obtaining of the\ncharacteristics of the influent and effluent waste water existing in each pond of the\ntreatment system and that of the effluent exiting the ponds.\n\nThe samples were collected in January and in March. In January, the samples were\ncollected twice a day, in the morning and at noon. Thrice a day on 30th March, 2024.\n\nFigure 3.1: Sampling from the inlet of the anaerobic pond\n3.3.2 Sample Preservation\nSome of the samples were assessed on site for Temperature and pH using Palin test pH\npocket meter. The samples were carefully stored in a cooler box at a temperature of\n26°C To minimize any alterations of the concentrations of the samples in each\ncontainer. They were then transported to the NWSC laboratory, Ruhuro for analysis of\nBOD, TN and TP. The methods used are summarized in Table 3.2.", "word_count": 412, "start_char": 60452, "end_char": 62933}
