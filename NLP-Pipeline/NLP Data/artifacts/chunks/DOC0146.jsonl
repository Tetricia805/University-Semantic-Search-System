This study evaluated the effectiveness of chorax72% fungicide in\ncontrolling late blight disease and its effect on yield of tomatoes. The research\nwas conducted using a randomized complete block design with three replications.\nThe different treatments dosages of Chorax 72% included the recommended\n(37.5g/10L of water), 25% higher (46.9g/10L) and 25% lower (28.1g/10L), a\nreference fungicide (mancozeb at 25g/10L) and untreated control. Data was\ncollected on severity, incidence and tomato yield including fruit yield weight and\nmarketable fruits. The results showed that there was significant difference\n(p<0.001) among the dosages of chorax72% on the disease severity and incidence.\nThere was also significant effect of Chorax 72% on yield weight (p=0.015) and\nmarketable fruits (p=0.012) of tomatoes. The 25% higher dosage of Chorax 72%\nshowed the lowest disease severity and incidence (1.54 ± 0.60a and 0.20 ± 0.12a\nrespectively) while the untreated control had the highest severity and incidence\nwith 2.97 ± 0.74d and 0.91±0.11d respectively. The recommended dosage produced\nthe highest fruit weight (2574g) and zero treatment had the lowest fruit weight\n(872g), both the recommended and 25% higher doses resulted in the highest\nnumber of marketable fruits(33.0fruits) compared to zero treatment (8.0fruits).\nThis implies that the recommended (37.5g/10L) and 25% higher dosages\n(46.9g/10l) of Chorax 72% inhibits the pathogen growth on tomatoes leading to\nincreased crop yield. Therefore, the recommended dosage (37.5g/10L) of\nchorax72% fungicide is recommended for controlling late blight disease in tomatoes\nin Uganda.\n\nii\n\nDEDICATION\nI dedicate this report to my beloved family and Aunt Joy Awori, their unweaving\nsupport (financially and spiritually) and encouragement have been a source of\nstrength during my study.

Late blight not only affects tomatoes but also crops like\npotatoes and its management is pivotal for maintaining productivity. The late\nblight disease has characteristic symptoms such as water-soaked, gray-green\ncircular lesions on leaves, as the disease progress ,the spots darkens and a white\nfungal growth forms underside the leaves eventually colonizing the whole plant\n(Quesada-Ocampo & Meadows, 2019)). This interrupts the plant’s physiological\nprocesses leading to drying off of leaves, fruits with greasy spots hence the death\nof the whole plant. The use of a resistant variety is the best option tin the\nmanagement of this disease, despite that the pathogen is more aggressive and\nhighly adaptive in the environment, and a breakdown of resistance is reported", "word_count": 301, "start_char": 11381, "end_char": 13591}

So, the most reliable strategy left is the use of integrated\ndisease management (IDM) for the disease, where fungicides stands as the most\neffective over the disease t(DEY et al., 2024).\nThe combination of cymoxanil and mancozeb has gained attention for its\neffectiveness against late blight. Cymoxanil is a systemic fungicide that can\npenetrate the plant leaves rapidly and act by preventing sporulation in fungi\n(Action, n.d) hindering the reproduction of spores from infected plants. While as\nmancozeb is a protectant fungicide that provides abroad spectrum contact action,\ndisrupting fungal enzyme functions (Gullino et al., 2010). The dual action of the\ntwo active ingredients in chorax72% makes it a promising solution for tomato\nfarmers in Uganda facing this threat of late blight. Though its effectiveness is not\nknown yet. The study therefore assessed the effectiveness of chorax72% fungicide\nin controlling late blight disease in tomatoes for improved growth and yield.\n1.2 Problem statement.\nDespite the benefits of tomatoes, its production is challenged by the devastating\npathogen phytophthora infestans (Akello L et al., 2023). The disease is reported to\ncause losses of about 30-70% (Akello L et al., 2023) studies showed a yield loss of\nupto 79.47% in susceptible under the favorable conditions for the pathogen.\nManagement of the disease basically relies on synthetic Fungicides that stands out\nto be the effective strategy under intense disease pressure like Dithane\n(mancozeb), bravo (chlorothalinil) and indofil M-45(mancozeb) (Haveri et al.,\n2018). The repetitive use of the same type and formulations of the fungicide has\nled to development of resistance in P. infestans diminishing the long-term\nefficiency of these chemicals (Cohen et al., 2020).

These exists on the Asian continent (India) where\nclimatic conditions differ from Uganda's and this which may alter the genetic\nmake-up of the pathogen and support the growth-patterns of crops differently\nhence affecting the response to the fungicide by the plant and the pathogen.\nHowever, for chorax72% fungicide formulation and field applicability, limited\ninformation is known on its effectiveness under Uganda's unique environment and\nthe farmers behavior of applying without observing the prescribed dosages.\nTherefore, this study evaluated the effectiveness of chorax72% fungicide in\ncontrolling late blight disease and its effect on yield of tomatoes.\n1.3 Research Objectives.\n1.3.1 General objective.\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of Chorax72%fungicide in controlling the late blight\nin tomatoes for improved tomato yields.\n1.3.2.

Altering the dosages of chorax72% fungicide will significantly affect the\nyield of tomatoes.\n1.5 Justification of the study.\nChorax 72%, a fungicide containing 8% cymoxanil and 64% mancozeb has been\ndeveloped as one of the potential materials that can contribute to the\nmanagement of late blight disease that causes devastating losses in the world.\nBased on the studies and applicability of the active ingredients contained in the\nfungicide, they show positive results when used as a single or mixed with other\nfungicides in inhibiting the growth and development of the pathogen p. infestans\n(Ogolla et al., 2021). This combination promises enhanced effectiveness by\ntargeting the pathogen at different stages of its life cycle since the active\ningredients in it have different and unique mode of action towards the pathogen.\nHowever, for any new chemical introduced in a country its mandatory to go\nthrough the ministry of agriculture (MAAIF) for approval and registration under the\nAgricultural chemical control, Act 2006. This applies to the fungicide in study\nbefore its distribution and adoption, its important to assess its efficacy under the\nagro-ecological conditions of Uganda against the strains of the pathogen present.\nThe research evaluated the effectiveness of chorax 72% in controlling late blight\nand its impact tomato yield. The study would help the MAAIF stake holders in\nmaking informed decisions and recommendations of the dosage for farmers\nadoption in managing the late-blight disease.\n1.6 Significance.\nTomato (Solanum lycopersicum) is one of the major horticultural crops grown\nextensively for its nutritious edible fruits (Akejo & Obbo, 2017).

LITERATURE REVIEW.\n2.1.1. The importance of the Tomato production.\nTomatoes are a crucial component of global diet, with production levels reaching\n180 million tones per year as of 2019, ranking them as the most important\nvegetable crop (Hong et al., 2022). They are rich in vitamins phytonutrients and\nminerals contributing to public health and nutrition (khanh et al., 2020). The\neconomic importance of tomatoes extends beyond their nutritional value, they are\nan essential source of income for millions of farmers and play a key role in national\nincome particularly in developing countries (Khanh et al., 2020).\n2.1.2 Late blight.\nLate blight is devastating disease caused by the oomycete pathogen pytophthora\ninfestans. This pathogen is notorious for causing the Irish potato famine in 1840s\nthat led to death of over million people (Quesada-Ocampo & Meadows, 2019) .it\naffects tomatoes and other members of the solanaceae family such as potatoes,\npetunias and nigh shade. With several symptoms on the tomato plant ; irregular\nwater soaked lesions on leaves, often with a lighter halo around them, white\ncottony growth on the underside of leaves where sporangia forms, brown to gray\nlesions on the surface of leaves, blighted leaves and stems that curl, shrive and\neventually die and rotted fruit with greasy spots that become leathery and\nchocolate brown ((Nelson, 2008)\n2.1.3. Origin and distribution of P. infestans\nPhytophthora infestans originated in America and has since spread globally (fry et\nal., 2016). As a hemibiotrophic pathogen, it takes nutrients from living tissues and\ntransitions to necrotic phase, decaying its host tissues during infection (Zhang et", "word_count": 321, "start_char": 20583, "end_char": 22708}

The ability of P. infestans to thrive in various environmental conditions\nhas facilitated its widespread distribution and emergence as a major pathogen\nresponsible for substantial crop losses in tomatoes worldwide (fry et al., 2016).\n2.2. Disease development and lifecycle.\nThe development of late blight disease is influenced by several environment\nfactors including temperature, humidity and leaf wetness duration optimal\ntemperature ranges between 15-25 degrees with relative humidity >90% or\nprolonged leaf wetness (Gonzalez ,et al .,2021) under these conditions the\nsporangia produced by p.infestans can germinate rapidily and infect the host\ntissue. The pathogen can undergo both sexual and asexual life cycle. The asexual\nlife cycle of Phytophthora infestans is characterized by alternating phases of\nhyphal growth, sporulation, sporangia germination (either through zoospore\nrelease or direct germination, i.e. germ tube emergence from the sporangium),\nand the re-establishment hypha growth.(Nowicki,et al.,2013).\n2.3. Economic importance of late blight in the tomato production.\nThe economic implications of p.infestans outbreaks are profound, as late blight\ncan lead to catastrophic yield losses, often exceeding 50% in severely affected\nareas within a short span of time (Duarte c et al., 2018). The pathogen’s rapid\nreproduction and adaptability through genetic mutations enable it to overcome\nhost resistance through genetic mutations enable it to overcome host resistance\nand fungicide application, hence this necessitates continuous management efforts\n(Duarte c et al., 2018). So the fear of late blight prompts farmers to apply\nfungicides prophylactically and multiple sprays to overcome it which affects the\ngrowers economically (Yang et al.,2023).", "word_count": 293, "start_char": 22417, "end_char": 24486}

A\nstudy found that leaf extracts from onions, garlic, Malus toringo revealed positive\ninhibition of the mycelial growth of P. infestans. Other antagonists such as Bacillus\nsubtilis B5 and Trichoderma viride have also been found to be effective. (Lal et al.,\n2017)\n2.4.3 Host resistance\nThe use of resistant varieties is among the most effective and environmentally safe\ntools for late blight management (FAO, 2008).\nThe host plant resistance reduces the incidence of late blight; delays the onset and\ndevelopment of disease and the required number of sprays. Plant resistance for\nlate blight started with the introduction of the resistance gene (R-gene) though it\nhas been broken by virulent strains (Binyam et al., 2014).\n2.4.4. Chemical management;\nFungicides application remains the most prevalent method of managing late blight\nin tomatoes. There are several fungicides available for late-blight management\nsuch as; Mancozeb, Mancozeb+ Metalaxyl, Ridomil Gold, indofila, Mancolaxyl,\n(Mancozeb and Metalaxy-M), Fungomil, Mancolaxyl 72% among others (Haverkort,\net al., 2012).

It\ncontrols diseases during the incubation period and prevents the appearance of\ndamage on the crop. ((Safety et al., 2024). Mancozeb, a dithiocarbonate, disrupts\nthe\npathogen’s\nextracellular\nenzyme\nproduction\nand\nspore\ngermination\nmechanisms (fry, 2016).\n2.5.2. Field trials of cymoxanil + mancozeb combinations.\nStudies have shown that a combination cymoxanil and mancozeb is highly effective\nin controlling late blight when applied as a prophylactic measure (before\nappearance of disease symptom) as well as curative. (Sharma, 2013). Based on the\nfield study comparing different fungicides in the management of late blight in\npotatoes \"}(NA & MS, 2016), Recent studies on the investigation of the efficacy of\nfungicides in controlling the late blight shows that a combination of cymoxanil and\nmancozeb fungicides proved to be more effective in controlling the late blight\ndisease of tomatoes and it had a positive impact on the yield of tomatoes(Das,\n2022). A study by (Debnath S., et al 2009) also recorded that there was lowest\ndisease severity observed in the treatment with the mixture of sprays of mancozeb\n\n64%+ cymoxanil8%-72%wp@1500g/ha as compared to other sprays like infinity\n68.75% and metalaxyl8%+mancozeb 64%-72 wp when used in the management of\nlate blight disease.

MUARIK is located on spatial coordinates\n0 ̊27'60''N, 32 ̊36'24'' E at an altitudinal range of 1250m to 1320 m above mean sea\nlevel (Yost, D et al., 1990). The study site is within in the administrative\nboundaries of Nangabo sub county, Wakiso district abou19 kilometers north of\nKampala along the Gaya-Zirobwe road, sited on 650 hectares serving as a hub for\ntraining, research, outreaches and agricultural production.\nKabanyolo is part of the Lake Victoria basin that receives an average annual\nprecipitation of 1218 mm and slightly drier periods in June to July and December\nto February. The average annual temperature is 21.5 ̊C making it suitable for\nagricultural projects (Komutunga, E.T. et al.,2001).\n3.2. Materials and equipments\nThe Ansal f2 tomato variety was used for the study, seedlings were raised and\nmanaged using standard nursery practices at MAURIK. Transplanting was done four\nweeks after seedling emergence with handful of organic manure per plant. Three\ndifferent concentrations of chorax72% fungicide (recommended dosage, 25% higher\nand 25% lower than the recommended dosage), mancozeb as a reference fungicide\nand the untreated were included for comparisons. The agronomic practices that\nare weeding, pruning and gap filling were done as recommended.\nThe equipment used included: knapsack sprayer, Data sheets (hard copies), long\nruler, disease diagnosis manuals, tags, pencils, Weighing scale.\n\n3.3. Experimental design.\nThe experimental field was laid out in a randomized complete block design with\nreplications (Olsson, 1978) The plots size were measuring 3m×3 m with 15 plots.\nCovering the total area of 135 square meters. The seedlings were transplanted at a\nspacing of 50cm ×50 cm with a total of 36 plants per plot. The experiment relied\nentirely on natural infection (Gudero et al., 2018).\n3.3.1.

The maximum disease severity (2.967±0.7412) was\nrecorded in the control. Among the treatments, lowest was recorded in the 25%\nhigher dosage of chorax72%@46.9/10litre of water (1.778±0.71). The maximum\ndisease incidence (0.91 ± 0.11d) was recorded in the control (zero treatment)\nwhereas the minimal disease incidence (0.2018 ± 0.118 a) recorded from the 25%\nhigher dosage. This implies that increasing the dosage above the recommended\nslightly improves the control of disease severity and incidence, untreated plants\nare most vulnerable to the infestation pathogen. Similarly, the findings reinforce\nthat using chorax72 fungicide reduced the disease progress as it was when\nmoximate (cymoxanil8+mancozeb 64%) had the lowest disease intensity among\nother fungicides (Kumar .P et al., 2018).\n5.2 For objective Two: To determine the effect of altering the fungicide dosages\non the yield of tomatoes.\nChorax72% fungicide had a positive effect on the tomato yield of tomatoes which is\nsimilarly to the study by (R. Das et al.,2022) (figure 2); where the treatment with\ncombination of cymoxanil8+mancozeb 64% fungicide had the maximum yield of\ntomatoes as compared to other chemicals. The significant difference in yield\nweights with chorax72% fungicide especially at recommended dose of suggests that\n\nthe fungicide effectively controlled the pathogen impact on the crop that might\notherwise limit fruit development and weight gain. This is supported by previous\nresearch findings that the fungal infection can significantly reduce the\nphotosynthetic capacity and nutrient allocation with tomato plants for fruit\ndevelopment (Smith et al.,2018).\nIn the present study, the minimum p. infestans progress and maximum fruit yield\nwas found in the treatment with chorax72% fungicide that is 25%higher dosage and\nrecommended dosage. This could be explained by the fact that higher dosages\nwere efficient enough to inhibit the diseases producing activity of the pathogen in\nthe plant, which resulted into a better overall growth and health of the tomato\nplants treated as compared to the other treatments ((Sharma, 2013). However, this\nresearch did not look at the infestation levels of pathogen at different growth\nstages of tomato yet its also important to know which the pathogen is most\neffective for efficient control.", "word_count": 445, "start_char": 35537, "end_char": 38457}

According to the\nresults, chorax72% had a significant difference (p<0.001) in late blight disease\nincidence and severity in tomatoes treated with different dosages of chorax72%.\nWith low severity and incidence shown in25%higher dosage (1.54± 0.60and0.20 ±\n0.12respectively) and high severity and incidence was observed when no\nchorax72% was applied with (2.97±0.74&0.91 ± 0.11) respectively, therefore with\nthese results, I fail to accept the hypothesis.\nFor objective two, the hypothesis stated that altering the fungicide dosages will\nhave significant effect on the yield of tomatoes and based on the results, there\nwas a significant positive effect on the yield(p=0.012). Therefore, there I fail to\nreject the hypothesis\n6.2 Recommendations\nOne season evaluation of the chorax72% fungicide cannot give a conclusive\ninformation about its effectiveness thus a need for further assessment. Therefore,\nfurther study should be done for over three seasons and on what stage the disease\neffects on the crop are more severe.", "word_count": 214, "start_char": 38257, "end_char": 39676}
