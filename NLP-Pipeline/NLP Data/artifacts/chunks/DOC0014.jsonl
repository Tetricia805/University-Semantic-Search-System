Street vending in this case means a marketing system made up of\nmany buyers and sellers normally offering very small quantities for sale at a time on the streets.\nThis chapter covers the background of the study, the problem statement, the research objectives\nand questions, justification and the significance of the study, the scope of the study, the\nconceptual framework of the research and the definitions of the key words that will be used in\nthe study.\n1.1 Background of the Study\nGlobally, street vending by children is a prevalent issue that affects millions of the young people\naround the world. According to a report by the international Labour organization (ILO, 2017), an\nestimated 152 million children are engaged in child labor, with a significant number involved in\nstreet vending activities. This form of child labor is often driven by poverty, lack of access to\neducation and other socio-economic factors (UNICEF, 2019).\nArticle 32 of the UNCRC states that children should be protected from economic exploitation,\nand from performing work that is likely to be hazardous or interfere with the child’s education or\nbe harmful to the child’s health or physical, mental, spiritual moral or social development yet\nthey are still being exploited. Street vending is therefor, the selling of goods or services on the\nstreet or public places. It involves vendors setting up temporary stalls, stands to sell and hawk\nitems like clothes, tomatoes, onions, food, soap, brooms among others.\nNorth America during the American colonial period, street food that was sold was tripe, oyster’s,\nroasted corn and sweets. Europe of that time also knew about street food vending where by\npotatoes were sold on the streets of Paris in 19th century and where the origin of French fries.\nTransylvanian child vendors of the same time sold cookies, cream mixed with corn, and bacon,\nLondoners could buy on the street tripe, pea soup, pea pods in butter, whelk, prawns and jellied\neels. Street vending is also a common activity in India, japan and the Bangladesh (ILO, 2020)", "word_count": 411, "start_char": 12750, "end_char": 15324}

In Asia,\nchildren are also involved in street vending activities, particularly in countries with high levels of\npoverty and informal economies (Save the children, 2020).\nNapoleon A Bamfo, Africa Insight (2018) fond that school-aged children selling on the street in\nSub-Saharan African cities is a popular pastime that supplants school. Parents and public\nofficials believe that it is prudent to deny truancy is an existential problem. Parents feel absolved\nfrom the moral responsibility of ensuring their children attend school and governments feel\ndisobliged to address truancy as a policy issue, paradoxically, the cost of parents and\ngovernments doing nothing to address truancy could be much higher than the cost of addressing\nit. This exposes children to exploitation, abuse, and hazardous working conditions. They may\nalso face risks such as violence, trafficking and substance abuse quit school, unintended\npregnancy, and illiteracy. Government’s antipoverty programs and appeals to children to stay in\nschools have not worked.\nNationally, the prevalence of street vending by children differs from country to country. In\nUganda provisional results from the 2018 population census data show that about a half of the\nUgandan population, 34.9 million comprise of children under 15 years of age while 17.1 million\nchildren are aged under 18 years (UBOS 2018). Such a large population of children has various\nimplications for resource allocation and service provision when considered in relation to other\npopulation categories. There has been an increase in the number of children trading or working\nin the rural areas of Uganda which affects their lives and this can be linked to a lot of factors\nwhich according to Dustmann (2021), are: expenses of schooling, features of the child, parents,\nhouseholds, and community, location and distance of primary school.\nStreet vending by children of school going age is a threat to the progressive survival of the\nsociety. It warps government policies in the education of the young ones. It also distorts\nacquisition of vocational skills and important education thereby destroying the economic sector\n(Esweren 2008). Danesty and Okediran (2021) lamented that street hawking among pupils have\npsychologically imposed other problems, like sex networking behavior, juvenile delinquent\nbehavior which takes most of the students school time and result to poor academic performance", "word_count": 460, "start_char": 15041, "end_char": 18032}

However, parents and guardians are\nfaced with the problems of running the families and provision for the primary needs of their\nchildren during this period when the rate of joblessness and poverty level is at the peak according\nto Marie (2023). It is probably riskiest type of trading country wide.\nIn Masaka, dozens of child street vendors defied directives by Masaka city council to vacate the\nstreets and return to school. The minors majorly boys as young as 11 years old, are still vending\ndifferent items despite a pronouncement by the city authorities to force them back into school.\nThe children are seen selling apples, mangoes, cassava, bananas, and vegetables, maize. And\nother items. In January, Masaka city education office and probation officer issued a one-week\nultimatum to all child vendors to vacate the streets and return to schools following the re-opening\nof schools. Children in Uganda often engage in street vending due to poverty, lack of access to\neducation, and limited economic opportunities, thus exposing them to education disruption,\nexploitation and abuse, health risks, psychological impact, social stigma.\nIn Western Division of Tororo Municipality, the emergence of street vending has been so\ncommon of which it has now become an eyesore situation. The pathetic aspect of it is that\nchildren are the victim of this omen. According to Ndipe (2010), sick perverts capitalize on this\n“accepted practice of street hawking by the kids and lure these unsuspecting traders to their\nhouse with the pretext of patronizing their wares. Then innocent children soon become the\nsubject of sexual abuse and a threat of punishment would silent them of speaking out. According\nto the Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation (2017), there are more than five\nhundred child vendors in Western Division of Tororo Municipality, 80% of who are adolescents\nsome of whom are still in primary schools. Besides, there is no study that has been conducted in\nWestern Division of Tororo Municipality on the effect of street vending on lives of pupils thus\ncreating a research opportunity for this study.\n1.2 Statement of the Problem\nDespite well-funded government programs for in the country, preliminary findings show that\nchildren continue to street vend in the Division.

The dependent variable (DV)le in\nthis case is lives of pupils with parameters of nutrition, school performance, teenage marriages\nand Juvenile delinquent behavior. The framework assumes that when street vending of children\nis eliminated, it is likely to transform the lives of pupils. Nevertheless, this may not be automatic\nas other factors may come into play. These may include government policies and existence of\nchild rights laws. These factors have been dully coined as intervening variables by the study and\nare being isolated to avoid making wrong conclusions.\n1.10 Key Definitions\nStreet vending: Is a marketing system made up of many buyers and sellers normally offering\nvery small quantities for sale at a time on the streets (Olukosi, Isitor, and Ode, 2021).\n\nPupil’s Lives: Characteristics of life among young children (Omondi et al., 2020)", "word_count": 380, "start_char": 24154, "end_char": 26636}

Introduction.\nThis chapter was about the effect of street vending on lives of pupils in Western Division of\nTororo Municipality, Tororo district. According to Mugenda and Mugenda (2017) and Kumar\n(2019) interprets literature review as the systematic identification, location and analysis of\ndocuments containing information related to the research problem being investigated, which\nforms an integral part of the entire research process and makes a valuable contribution to almost\n\nevery operational step in the research. This chapter shows the various sources of related literature\nto the topic of the research. The sources include; review of scholarly journals, government\ndocuments, text books, Internet and Newspapers, it also presents theoretical review, actual\nreview on the effect of street vending on pupil’s lives. This Literature review was done objective\nby objective.\nIt presented the summary of the literature review highlighting gaps in the existing literature while\ngenerating and refining research ideas and drawing conclusions in line with the problem under\ninvestigation.\n2.2 Forms of street vending\nFresh product vending\nThese vendors sell fresh fruits, vegetables, and sometimes flowers. They often set up stalls or carts\nin busy areas to offer locally grown produce to customers.\nOkumadewa, (2008) opines that given that many fresh produce vending operate in public spaces,\nstreet vending is often a contentious issue, with tensions between vendors and municipal\nauthorities, residents and residents’ associations, and businesses routinely occurring.\nGovernments often mark fresh product child vendors and vending as disorderly and chaotic to\njustify removals and crackdowns and in the process, many children die. In reaction, vending or\ntrading unions are common as are alliances with NGOs, politicians, and political parties.\nAdditionally, fresh produce vending often self-organized, running along an internally created\norder that defies governmental assertions of chaos and disorder.\nAccording to UNICEF, population growth, recurring crises, extreme poverty and inadequate\nsocial protection measures have led to an additional 17 million girls and boys engaging in child\nlabour in sub-Saharan Africa over the past four years. African countries are home to most of the\nworld's 160 million street vending children dealing in fresh products. The International Labour\nOrganization estimates that more than 72 million children in sub-Saharan Africa, nearly one in\nfive are involved in fresh products vending. Experts estimate that millions more are at risk of\njoining vending activities due to due to poverty.", "word_count": 402, "start_char": 26556, "end_char": 29299}

That is the reason child welfare is\nadded in the Millennium Development Goals (MDG), (UNESCO, 2010). But majority of them\nare denied this right by engaging them in different forms of street vending such as fresh foods\nvending. The street child is defined as any child who may have parents or guardians in a vicinity\nbut dwelling and working in the street. Street children engaged in fresh product vending on a\ndaily basis with the purpose of earning a livelihood for themselves or for their families. Such\nactivities are often executed at the expense of schooling. Therefore, children are not properly\nprepared for the future in a contemporary society, (UNICEF, 2010; FME, 2010). The current\nstudy will thus find out whether investigate pupils in western division of Tororo Municipality\nwho are involved in fresh product vending attend school.\nOlukosi, Isitor, and Od (2021) argued that fresh product vending is a marketing system made up\nof many buyers and sellers normally offering very small quantities for sale at a time. It is this\nmethod of marketing that becomes a point of concern to the researcher as he sees mostly children\nof school age involved in street vending. According to Nseabasi and Oluwabamide (2010),\nchildren engaged in street vending in fresh produce are a negation of the international convention\non the right of the child. It is indeed inhuman for anyone to involve a child in money-making\nventures; because such a child is denied primary education which is a right for every child. The\ncurrent study will find out whether fresh product vending violets the rights of pupils in western\nMobile technology vending\nMande et al., (2020) argued that mobile technology vending is shift towards liberalization brought\nmany effects on the Zimbabwean citizens. Privatization of major national companies and\ndownsizing of the civil service led to huge unemployment leaving people without any other\noption but to join the informal economy. Eventually, the reduction of the formal economy\nfueled the rapid expansion of the informal sector in mobile technology. Msoka (2016) posits\nthat the main actors in street vending are the most vulnerable people in a society.

Stationary vending set-ups vary, with\nsome vendors simply selling goods from a basket or a blanket on the ground, while others have a\nsemi-permanent stall that can be shuttered in the evening. Itinerant vending is also very common\nwith displays ranging from pushcarts to mobile or hand-held displays. Some vendors are on the\nmove to cater to a mobile population, with vending on trains or train platforms as a popular\nlocation. Other mobile technology child vendors may be mobile to avoid police tickets or\nharassment. While the term “street child vendor” is commonly used in the literature, other\ncommon terms include “trader,” “hawker,” and “peddler.” Street vendors and mobile technology\nare largely an entrepreneurial group, though some are wage workers. Many child mobile\ntechnology vendors tend to be poor, though this is not ubiquitous. In many contexts, vending\ndoes not provide a decent income, especially for those without formal education.\nFood vendors\nFood vendors sell a variety of ready-to-eat meals, snacks, and beverages. This category includes\nfood trucks, hot dog stands, taco trucks, ice cream carts, and mobile coffee shops.\nSince children involve in food vending and eat the food they vend, review by Okedelo (2020)\nindicated the studies are suggestive of possible development of diseases such as cancer later in\nlife among child venders of food products. According to the review, street vending was also\nassociated with increased risk of sore throat, cold, cough, eye irritation, dizziness, hearing\nimpairment, and musculoskeletal problems.\nAlthough mobile food vendors are a part of the street environment in many large U.S.\ncities, mobile food vending by children has not yet been addressed in the literature.

But majority of them\nare denied this right by engaging them in different forms of street vending such as fresh foods\nvending. The street child is defined as any child who may have parents or guardians in a vicinity\nbut dwelling and working in the street. Street children engaged in fresh product vending on a\ndaily basis with the purpose of earning a livelihood for themselves or for their families. Such\nactivities are often executed at the expense of schooling. Therefore, children are not properly\nprepared for the future in a contemporary society, (UNICEF, 2010; FME, 2010). The current\nstudy will thus find out whether investigate pupils in western division of Tororo Municipality\nwho are involved in fresh product vending attend school.\nSchool children who sell foods purchased in vending machines and consume the same foods are\nmore likely to develop poor diet quality and that may be associated with being overweight, obese\nor at risk for chronic health problems such as diabetes and coronary artery disease, according to\nresearch from the University of Michigan Medical School. These child street venders therefore\nsuffer from nutritional problems. Ogenga’s study (2021) looked at foods sold in school stores,\nsnack bars and other related sales of child food venders and concluded that these foods take lot\nof time to prepare and thus children miss out schools.\nOlukosi, Isitor, and Odel (2021) argued that fresh product vending is a marketing system made\nup of many buyers and sellers normally offering very small quantities for sale at a time. It is this\nmethod of marketing that becomes a point of concern to the researcher as he sees mostly children\nof school age involved in street vending. According to Nseabasi and Oluwabamide (2018),\nchildren engaged in street vending in fresh produce are a negation of the international convention\non the right of the child.

Soft drinks accounted for\nmore than two-thirds of beverages engaged in by child street venders bought from vending\nmachines and stores. Found in cities worldwide, street vendors sell hot and prepared food and\ndrinks, fruits and vegetables, clothing, electronics, media, souvenirs, and virtually everything\nelse. Street vendors also provide services like shoe shining and shoe repair.\nStreet-connected children often lack access to basic essentials like food, shelter, clothing, and\nhealthcare. This makes them vulnerable to malnutrition, illness and injury. Lack of access to\nessentials can also cause children to become street-connected as they seek means to get by. Street\nchildren are deprived of family care and protection. Most children on the streets are between the\nages of about 5 to 18 years old. Unprotected and unsupervised, these children are often targets of\ndeath squads, vigilante groups and police brutality. Government has made little effort to alleviate\ntheir conditions.\nExposure of these children to life on the street may lead to “poor adjustment, aggressive and\nantisocial behaviour, conduct disorders, communication difficulties, adjustment problems, poor", "word_count": 401, "start_char": 39060, "end_char": 41766}

They\nare sometimes mistreated so that they are traumatised and may possibly develop psychological\nproblems (Bruscino, 2001). According to the Bernard van Leer Foundation (2004:3) children’s\nearly experiences affect their development as well as the development of the society and the\nworld. Elliot and Davis (2009:113) agree that during the early years of development children\ndemonstrate the greatest ability to learn and develop. For this reason, it seems critical that\nnations invest in their young, thereby preparing and equipping them for future challenges. This,\naccording to Elbedour et al. (2002), poses a major challenge to the development of a child’s\nsense of trust, security and confidence.\nRaising children on the streets can cost Zimbabwe its chances of achieving the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals. Similarly, the Michigan State Board of Education (2006) posits that when\ninfants and toddlers are cared for in a setting outside their homes, such as in streets, responsive\nand nurturing caregiving requires deliberate and intensive attention to their physical and\nemotional needs as well as their inborn desire to make sense of the world about them. In view of\nall this, streets are not conducive environments for raising children (Samson & Cherrier, 2009:9).\nLikewise, a study carried out in Mexico City to find strategies developed by female street\nvendors indicated that children who remained on the streets with their mothers suffered more\nfrequently from gastro-intestinal diseases and accidents” (Hernandez 1996:169). The gastrointestinal pathology was found to be associated with the child remaining at the mother’s place of\nwork, where nursing, feeding and general care takes place in unsanitary conditions. Hernandez et\nal., (1996) furthermore note that the higher frequency of accidents among children who remain\nwith their mothers indicated the difficulty of caring for them adequately during the day, as well\nas the insufficiency of alternative domestic support networks. They conclude that there is a\nhigher risk (morbidity and accidents) for children of female street vendors than that found at\nnational level among the same group, and a particularly high risk among children under one year\n(Hernandez et al., 1996).\nUnder nutrition can lead to stunted growth and deficiency diseases, such as rickets, scurvy,\nkwashiorkor and anemia, while over-nutrition can lead to obesity in childhood or adulthood, with\nthe attendant diseases of obesity such as heart problems and diabetes (Woodward, 2019).

Hakim and Rahman (2015) confirm\nthat the greater bulk of children who live in street environments were found to be underweight\ngainers due to a lack of access to safe drinking water, scanty nutritious foods consumptions and a\nlack of hygienic practices. If their nutrients deficiencies exist for a long time, the authors add that\nthis results in interference with body functioning and increasing the occurrence of diseases.\nTherefore, children living in street environments are at a threat to a wide range of health\nconsequences and malnourishment.\n2.4 Measures of preventing pupils from engaging in street vending\nTo address the issue of street vending by children various initiatives and measures have been put\nin place to help stop the harmful practice.\nGlobal efforts to combat street vending by children have been multifaceted, involving various\nstakeholders such as international organizations, governments, NGOS, and local communities.\nThese efforts aim to address the root causes of child street vending while providing sustainable\nsolutions to protect children’s rights and well-being. They include:\nLegislation and policy: International bodies like the international lobour organization (ILO)\nhave developed conventions and guidelines to tackle child labor including street vending. These\nefforts aim to establish legal frameworks and policies that prohibit child labor and street vending\n(ILO, 2017). The most obvious government policy on street vending, mixing regulation with\npromotion, is to move children off-street locations, forming public or private markets. Most\nurban governments have attempted to do this but many new off-street markets have been\nestablished leading o resurgence of street children.\nRelatedly, several acts have been put in place to regulate street vendors. The first was the\nCleanliness and Order of the City Act issued in 1992. This act prohibited individuals from\ncooking and selling things on public roads and public areas. It also prohibited the use of cars and\ncarts for cooking food for economic purposes in public roads and areas, as well as selling\nmerchandise in cars or carts. Section 9 empowered local officials to prohibit vending activities.\nHowever, this law does not apply to private roads and properties.

They are also responsible for\ncleaning their work areas.\nEducation and awareness: Research conducted by UNICEF emphasizes the role of education\nand awareness campaign in combating street vending by providing children with alternatives and\nraising awareness among communities (UNICEF, 2019)\nSocial support programs: Global studies such as those by the World Bank, highlight the\neffectiveness of social support programs in reducing street vending by addressing poverty and\nproviding vulnerable families with access to resources and opportunities (World, 20180. In\nAfrica, regional studies conducted by organizations like Save the Children Africa stress the\nimportance of community engagement and empowerment in addressing the root causes of street\nvending such as poverty and lack of access to education (Save the Children2020)\nChild protection services: Research in African countries, such as Uganda and Kenya,\nunderscores the need for strengthened child protection services to identify and support children\ninvolved in street vending, providing them with access to education, healthcare, and protection\nfrom exploitation (MGLSD Uganda, 2018; ILO, 2016). In Uganda, national studies such as those\nconducted by the Ministry of Gender, Labour and Social Development (MLGSD) in Uganda\nhighlight the importance of the legislative measures and enforcement mechanism to combat\nstreet vending by children at the national level (MGLSD Uganda, 2018)\n\nSocial support programs: Research specific to Uganda emphasizes the effectiveness of social\nsupport programs including cash transfers and vocational training, in providing vulnerable\nfamilies with alternatives to street vending and supporting children’s education (UNICEF\nUganda, 2020). The key point is that there is a wide gulf between the broad aims and directives\nof senior administrators and politicians, and the ways policies can actually be worked out on the\nstreet. Regulating child street vendors, or offering and support, requires interactions between\ndozens of local officials and literally thousands of vendors, with enormous potential for\nmisunderstandings, avoidance and deception.

There is no real theory or code of ethics associated with regulating or\npromoting street vendors, and there is little public or higher-level administrative concern. Child\nstreet vendors are usually perceived as a problem and occasionally as a potential, but they are\nrarely high in the governmental list of priorities.\nEducation and awareness: National studies in Uganda also emphasizes the role of education\nand awareness campaign in raising awareness among families and communities about the\ndangers and consequences of child street vending (UNICEF Uganda, 2020). The various levels\nof government have responsibilities to limit congestion, road accidents and crime, and to protect\nconsumers against fraud and public health hazard s through education and awareness. More\nbroadly, governments have a responsibility to educate the masses about the dangers of street\nvending on school age going children. There is little disagreement across the political spectrum\non these general responsibilities of government, but there are enormous differences on how they\nshould be achieved. These differences are most extreme and most obvious at the bottom end of\nthe economic spectrum, in dealing with the smallest, most mobile and most transient vending\nenterprises. At this micro-level, the governmental apparatus can seem big, clumsy and\nimpersonal, or it can acquire personal dimensions associated with clientelism, paternalism,\ncorruption or victimization making it hard for school going children to leave street vending.\n2.4 Gaps in literature\nThough a number of studies were carried out on street vending however those addressing the\neffect of street vending on the lives of pupils are still limited, even those existing studies, were\ndone in a different geographical setting other than Tororo municipality, at different time and\nusing different methods (mostly mixed quantitative and qualitative approach). For example,\nLivingstone et al., (2022) broadly assessed effect of street vending and pupil discipline not lives\nof pupil. While other studies considered effect of street vending on pupil performance, pupil\nschool enrollment and pupil nutrition (such as Batte et al., 2021, Okedel, 2020).

It show the research design,\nstudy population, sample size and selection, sampling techniques and procedures, data collection\nmethods and techniques, validity and reliability of instruments, procedure of data collection, data\nanalysis and ethical considerations.\n3.1 Research Design\nA case study is a qualitative research design best suited for gaining an in-depth understanding of\na social phenomenon within its cultural context without imposing pre-existing expectations\n(Denzin & Lincoln, 2012). Gall et al. (2007) agree with this definition as they define a case study\nas an in-depth study of instances of a phenomenon in its natural context and from the\nperspectives of the participants involved in the phenomenon and in educational research. Best\nand Kahn (2006) also define a case study as a way of organizing social data for the purpose of\nviewing social reality. It examines a social unit as a whole. The social unit may be a person, a\nfamily, a social group or a community (Best & Kahn, 2006). Gall et al. (2007) propound that in a\ncase study, a significant amount of data are collected about the specific case selected to represent", "word_count": 363, "start_char": 52120, "end_char": 54443}

(2007) propound that in a\ncase study, a significant amount of data are collected about the specific case selected to represent\n\nthe phenomenon. The justification for the choice of a case study was that it restricted the\nresearcher to a small, manageable group, where rigorous and thorough explorations were made\nto examine the phenomenon of raising children on urban streets (Best & Kahn, 2006). The case\nstudy also provided in-depth, comprehensive and vivid data in this study, as well as a thick\ndescription thereof. It also enabled the researcher to gain an in-depth understanding of streets as\na context of improving lives of pupils.\nIn this study, the researcher used a multiple case study since the researcher had several cases to\nexamine. Baxter and Jack (2018) assert that if a study contains more than a single case, then a\nmultiple case study is vital. In a multiple case study, several cases are examined to understand\nthe similarities and differences between the cases. According to Baxter and Jack (2008), a\nmultiple case study enables the researcher to explore differences within and between cases. The\ngoal is to replicate findings across cases (Baxter & Jack, 2018). The use of multiple cases yields\nmore robustness to the conclusions from the study. Yin (2023) emphasizes that multiple cases\nstrengthen the results by replicating the patterns, thereby increasing the robustness of the\nfindings. In this study, the researcher interviewed six female street vendors with children aged\nthree years and one social worker. All the individuals presented their own case, telling their own\nstory and how they experience the phenomenon of street vending with young children in the\nstreets.\n3.2 Study Population\nThe population of study means all items of inquiry which constitute a universe or population\nwhich describes the sample size that was used to collect data to support the study (Kothari 2005).\nThe population of study comprised of 10 local leaders, 10 local people and 10 street child\nvenders. Local people are chosen to participate in this study because they are the guardians and\nparents of child street venders and have information regarding the effect of street vending on\nlives of pupils while local leaders are selected because effort at enforcing the protection of\nchildren and preventing child streetism. Additionally, child venders are chosen because they\nhave relevant information given their experience in struggling with street vending life and how\ntheir lives are affected.

Observation was chosen since young\nchildren have not yet developed camouflages to hide themselves from the public as adults do\n(Thorndike & Hagen, 2000). In this study, researcher observed children at their respective\nvending sites for about two weeks to ensure credibility.\n3.6 Quality control\n3.6.1 Validity\nThe validity of an instrument is defined as the ability of an instrument to measure what it is\nintended to measure. Validity considers how correctly the research tools measure what the\nresearcher wants to measure. Thus, validity is about the research tool being credible or\ntrustworthy or being accurate or correct (Etyang, 2018). After formulating the questionnaire, the\nsupervisors and other experts reviewed the items and checked the language clarity, content\ncomprehensiveness, and relevancy and how long the questionnaire is. To establish the validity of\nthe instruments, the researcher used expert judgement as recommended by Gay (1997) as the\nbest method for ensuring validity. Thus the researcher ensured that the instrument is clear,\nrelevant, specific and logically arranged. The validity of the interview guide was tested using the\ncontent validity test (CVI). To arrive at the relevancy of the questionnaire, the researcher\ndesigned the instrument that yielded content –valid data by first specifying the domain of\nindictors that are relevant to the concept being measured. A content-valid data measure contained\nall possible items that were used in measuring the effect of street vending on lives of pupils.\n3.6.2 Reliability\nA tool’s reliability shows the extent to which it is free of errors and for that makes sure that there\nis continuous valuation across time and also across the various items in the instrument. This\ntherefore means that a tool’s reliability shows how stably and consistently the tool evaluates the\nidea thereby helping to measure the worthiness of a measure (Sekaran & Bougie, 2016). The\nresearcher will employ the test-retest reliability. According to Sekaran and Bougie(2016), the\nreliability of the instrument is tested using the test re-test method of reliability and Cron-bach\nalpha tests to determine the reliability index with the help of SPSS. Data was collected from 20\npeople not among those in the sample. The principle of reliability as far as research instruments", "word_count": 441, "start_char": 59449, "end_char": 62341}

Thereafter, the\nresearcher sent consent letters to the responders requesting for them to participate in the study.\nRaw data was then be compared and coded before data analysis was done. During editing, points\nof views of the responders that seemed unclear were returned to them for checking so as to make\ncertain of the meaning of the seemingly ambiguous replies. Thereafter, the researcher writes a\nreport that was submitted to the department for examination.\n3.8 Data Processing and Analysis\nData analysis is the process of methodically applying logical techniques to describe and\nillustrate, summarize and recap, and evaluate data (Shamoo & Resnik, 2003). The task is to make\nsense of massive amounts of data, reduce the volume of information, identify significant patterns\nand construct an outline communicating the essence of what the data reveal (Best & Kahn,\n2006:270).\n3.8.1 Thematic analysis,\nAccording to Lapadat (2010), is a systematic approach to the analysis of qualitative data that\ninvolves identifying themes or patterns of cultural meaning; coding and classifying data, usually\ntextual, according to themes; and interpreting the resulting thematic structures by seeking\ncommonalties, relationships, overarching patterns, theoretical constructs, or explanatory\nprinciples. The analysis of data involved organizing into meaningful themes and categories.\nThemes, according to Ryan and Bernard (2017), are important concepts that show specific\nexperiences of participants by the more general insights that are apparent from the whole data\nset. Arranging data systematically and thematically from transcripts facilitated the discussion of\nthe findings via the themes and categories (Creswell, 2017).

First, observation data were analyzed and\norganized into meaningful themes and categories. Interview data were also organized according\nto individual responses and analyzed by grouping answers together across participants. Field\nnotes gathered during observations were also examined and presented with the actual quotations\nto show the real effect of the vending activities on these children. Interviews and conversations\nwere audio recorded to facilitate qualitative analysis of explanation of the data gathered from\nthese.\n3.9 Data collection procedure\nThe researcher selected and presented a research topic to the department of education which was\napproved. Thereafter the researcher developed a research proposal. After approval of the\nresearch proposal, the researcher obtained an introductory letter from the Head of department\nwhich was presented to the relevant authorities in the study area for data collection. Thereafter\nthe researcher writes a report which is to be presented to the department for further examination.\n3.9Ethical considerations\n\nThe following ethical considerations were looked at by the researcher during the research.\n3.9.1 Informed consent and voluntary participation: The researcher sought consent from the\nrespondents to involve in the research not just forcing them to participate. Informed consent is\nthe basis of ethical research (Denzin & Lincoln, 2016). The people participating in the study\nwere made aware of what the study was about, it’s purpose, usage of the data, and any\nconsequences that could arise from it(Fleming, 2018). The researcher furnished the respondents\nwith information on the reason for the research and the procedure of collecting data. The\nparticipants were allowed enough time to ask questions and have any concerns addressed. The\nrespondents exercised free will in deciding whether to participate in research activity or not. All\npeople to be involved in the research were given written informed acceptance.\n3.9.2 Confidentiality: Confidentiality is looked at by Walford(2018) to mean information that is\nprivate andis not to be divulged to others.

Their\nidentity and response were made confidential and anonymized through the use of numbers or\nthrough pseudonyms.\n3.9.3 Anonymity: Anonymity, termed more appropriately as pseudonymity, is defined by Wiles\n(2013) as a major meansused by the researcher to safeguard the confidentiality of responders by\nusing pseudonyms.Anonymisation is one of the kinds of confidentiality, comprising of identity\nconcealment of research responders (Saunders, Kitzinger, & Kitzinger, 2015). The researcher\nensured that all respondents are anonymous implying that their identities are not known and not\nsalient in the study. Withholding the identity of respondents is a guarantees that their statements\nare authentic (Taylor, 2015).\n3.9.4 Plagiarism: The researcher ensured that all written work was original and without any\nborrowed and manipulated texts, results or even expressions. The researcher made sure that, all\nwords and publications of the author were given their due acknowledgement (Mugenda &\nMugenda, 2016). The researcher subjected the written works to the turn it in software and make\nsure it was 15% or less compliant of plagiarism material.\n3.13\nMethodological constraints\nThe study was affected by non-response rate. This was due to the fact that some respondents may\nbe hesitant to give information. However, this was solved through having a dialogue with\nrespondents and explaining clearly the purpose of the study.\nThe problem of limited time, many respondents did not have enough time to respond adequately\nto the questions while attending to their busy schedules.\nIn adequate finances, the researcher had little funds to move to and fro the field and more so\nbuying the necessary requirements used in the study. However, friends and relatives contributed\nto solve the situation.\n3.7 Variable definition and Measurement\nStreet vending: Is a marketing system made up of many buyers and sellers normally offering\nvery small quantities for sale at a time on the streets (Olukosi, Isitor, and Ode, 2021).

The presentation was guided by the general objective of the study that sought to\ninvestigate the effect of street vending on lives of pupils in Western Division of Tororo\nMunicipality, Tororo district. Specifically, the study was aimed at finding out the forms of street\nvending and the effect of street vending on lives of pupils in Western Division of Tororo\nMunicipality, Tororo district. It also examined measures of preventing pupils from engaging in\nstreet vending in Western Division of Tororo Municipality, Tororo district. The interview and\nobservation were organized with three themes connecting directly with specific objectives. The\ntechniques used were effective because they helped the researcher to gathering valid data and\ninformation. The three themes are consequently discussed below:\n4.1 Participation Rate\nA total of 15 participants (6 women and 9 men) participated in the study this shows that data was\ncollected from all the intended sample of pupils and this was a good representation as proposed\nby the researcher. Of the 15 survey participants most respondents were in the 26-35 age bracket\nand female. Few of the 81% of employed respondents had job tenure beyond seven years. All of\nthe men surveyed were employed whereas 27% of the women surveyed -- or 9 out of 33 -- were\nunemployed. 66% of respondents subscribed to Orthodox Christian religious denomination.\nParticipants were not asked to specify race.\nFor purposes of anonymity, the following abbreviations were used\nLL (1-4) for local leaders\nLP (1-4) for local people\nCSV (1-4) for pupils doing street vending", "word_count": 431, "start_char": 68837, "end_char": 71526}
