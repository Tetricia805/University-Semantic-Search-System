It is the standard style used in research papers, theses,\ndissertations, technical reports, and journal articles.\nqMain features\nq Clarity and Precision\nqObjectivity\nqStructure and Organization, e.g. IMRaD: Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion.\nqEvidence-based (Literature Review)\nqFormal Tone\nqConciseness\nqConsistency and Accuracy\n\nLiterature Review - Introduction\nqA literature review is a structured summary and\nevaluation of what has already been written and\nresearched on a particular topic.\nIt is not just a list of sources—it is a critical synthesis\nthat:\n• Explains what is already known.\n• Highlights gaps, debates, and trends.\n• Shows how your research fits into the bigger picture.\n\nWhy Literature Review?\nqPurpose of a Literature Review\n1.Context → Places your research in relation to what has\nalready been studied.\n2.Evaluation → Assesses the quality and relevance of existing\nstudies.\n3.Identification of Gaps → Shows what is missing or\nunderexplored.\n4.Justification → Provides a rationale for why your study is\nneeded.\n5.Framework → Helps you refine research questions, methods,\nand theoretical foundation.\n\nTypes of Literature Review\nqNarrative/Traditional → A broad summary without\nstrict methods.\nqSystematic → A highly structured, comprehensive,\nand replicable review.\nqScoping → Explores the extent and nature of research\non a topic.\nqCritical → Goes beyond description to analyze and\ncritique methods, findings, and assumptions.\n\nSteps to doing Literature Review\nqSearch → Use academic databases (Scopus, Web of Science, Google\nScholar, IEEE, etc.).\nqSelect → Apply inclusion/exclusion criteria to filter relevant studies.\nqRead Critically → Ask: What’s the purpose? What methods are used?\nWhat are the strengths/limitations?\nqOrganize → Group studies into themes (e.g., by method, theory,\nfindings, or chronology).\nqSynthesize → Compare and contrast, find connections, and highlight\ndifferences.\nqWrite → Present a logical narrative that builds toward your research\ngap.\n\nCharacteristics of a Good Literature Review\nqFocused: Stays relevant to the research\nproblem/topic.\nqCritical: Evaluates, doesn’t just summarize.\nqOrganized: Flows by theme/idea, not by article.\nqCurrent: Covers up-to-date works. Less than 8Years\nqBalanced: Includes multiple perspectives.", "word_count": 448, "start_char": 0, "end_char": 3229}

Few\nstudies integrate domain knowledge with ML models,\nleaving a gap in practical applicability.”\n\nNote to remember\nq“understanding literature review”\nmeans realizing it is not just about\nreading and summarizing articles—it’s\nabout connecting, critiquing, and\nsynthesizing them to create a\nfoundation for your own research\n\nActivity\nSelect a topic and conduct a systematic literature review\nfollowing the PRISMA protocol\nqPRISMA = (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses)\nqTo be done individually, but each member should present and discuss with\ngroupmates.\nqNo repetition of topics among groupmates groups\nqA 3-page review paper should be prepared (in Latex with proper referencing an\nuse of tools)\nqDraft paper 1 – 8th October 2025\nqFinal Paper Wednesday 15th October 2025)\nqPoster presentation ( Friday 17th October 2025)\n\nComputer Science students topics\nqArtificial Intelligence & Machine Learning\n1.\nA critical review of explainable AI (XAI) approaches and their\neffectiveness.\n2.\nLiterature review on bias and fairness in machine learning models.\n3.\nComparative analysis of deep learning vs. traditional ML methods for\nimage recognition.\n4.\nReview of federated learning for privacy-preserving applications.\n5.\nThe role of transfer learning in natural language processing.\n6.\nQuantum Computing for Machine Learning: Opportunities and\nChallenges\n\nData Science Student’s topics\nqLiterature review on real-time big data analytics frameworks.\nqCritical analysis of data cleaning and preprocessing techniques in\nlarge datasets.\nqReview of graph-based approaches for social network analysis.\nqCloud vs. edge computing for big data applications: A\ncomparative study.\nqBlockchain for Cybersecurity: Current Applications and\nLimitations\n\nFinal remarks\n\nSignificance of the hour glass in writing\n\n@ugandachristianuniversity\n@UCUniversity\n@UgandaChristianUniversity\nP.O.
