The study investigated the impact\nof different doses of garlic extract on plant height, leaf damage, Number of aphids and Number of flowers\nat the flowering stage. The garlic extract was prepared by crushing garlic bulbs and sieved to achieve the\ndesired concentrations after mixing it with the desired concentrations of rabbit urine. The experiment\nemployed a randomized complete block design with four treatment groups each replicated three times:\na control group (0%), low dose (10%), medium dose (30%), and high dose (50%) of the mixture\nconcentration of rabbit urine and garlic extract concoction. The treatments were applied using a handheld\nsprayer, and the plants were monitored for aphid populations using visual inspection. Data collected were\nsubjected to statistical analysis, including analysis of variance (ANOVA), to determine significant\ndifferences between treatments. The results revealed that higher doses of garlic extract and rabbit Urine\nconcoction led to increased plant height, decrease in leaf damage caused by aphids, , and reduced number\nof aphids as well as increased number of flowers. The control group exhibited the lowest values for all\nparameters, while treatments with garlic extract and rabbit urine concoction showed significant\nimprovements. The highest yields were observed in Treatment 50%, where plants treated with the highest\ndose of garlic extract and rabbit urine concoction had the highest plantt height, least number leaves\ndamaged by aphids and highest number of flowers at flowering stage. These findings demonstrate the\npotential of garlic extract and rabbit urine concoction as an effective aphid control agent, capable of\nenhancing tomato crop health and growth and economic returns for farmers.\n\niii\n\nDECLARATION\nI, ISOOBA DAVID BECKHAM, declare that; I am the author of this research report and any\nassistance I received in its preparation is fully acknowledged and disclosed in the report.

Originally hailing from South America, particularly Peru and Ecuador, the tomato\nwas first cultivated and domesticated in Mexico (Benton, 2007). During the middle of the 16th\ncentury, the tomato made its way to Europe. It was mainly showcased in early herbals for its visual\nappeal, but it wasn't commonly consumed, except in Italy and Spain. In fact, many people believed\nthe fruit to be poisonous, and it took until 1800 for it to be recognized as a valuable vegetable. Fast\nforward to today, the tomato is now extensively cultivated across the globe due to its delightful\ntaste, vibrant color, rich flavor, and nutritious qualities. Tomatoes are a versatile food that can be\nenjoyed in various ways, either straight from the garden or after undergoing processing. Including\ntomatoes in your diet can be beneficial for maintaining a healthy and balanced eating plan. Not\nonly do they contain very few calories, but they are also packed with essential nutrients like\nvitamin A, vitamin C, and various minerals. Additionally, tomatoes provide small but valuable\namounts of vitamins from the B complex, including thiamin, riboflavin, and niacin, as noted by\nSainju and Dris 2006.\n1.1 Background of the study\nTomato (Lycopersicon esculentum L) belongs to the Solanaceae family and is an important and\nlucrative vegetable crop grown around the world including Uganda for fresh market and\nprocessing. It is ranked as the third most important vegetable worldwide (Shiberu et al., 2018). In", "word_count": 297, "start_char": 12255, "end_char": 14155}

Globally, tomato production\nis at 177.04 million metric tons while in Uganda is at 38,234 metric tons (FAOSTAT, 2016).\nTomatoes are a good source of iron and contain lycopene, an antioxidant that may protect against\ncancer. Yellow tomatoes have more vitamin A than red ones (Naika et al., 2005). Research\nindicates that lycopene, a compound found in tomatoes, may lower the chances of prostate cancer\n(Miller et al., 2002). Additionally, consuming tomatoes can potentially decrease the likelihood of\ngastroenteric diseases like colon, rectal, and stomach cancer. Moreover, tomatoes are easily\ndigestible and their vibrant color can boost your appetite (Sainju and Dris, 2006).\nPlant diseases and pests can cause significant economic losses in agricultural production. A study\nconducted by Tolman et al. (2004) found that insect damage led to a loss of approximately 30%\nin tomato yield. Detecting infested plants at an early stage, before visual symptoms appear, is\ncrucial for implementing effective management strategies and pest control measures to prevent\nthe spread of diseases (Zee et al., 2001; Park et al., 2016). Currently, we rely heavily on\ninsecticides to control aphids. However, this has led to some aphid species, like the peach,\ntomato, and potato aphid, becoming resistant to these chemicals. To address this issue, we need\nalternative methods of aphid control. One potential solution is using plant extracts that repel\naphids or discourage them from feeding. This could help decrease the number of aphids on plants\nwithout relying solely on insecticides (Bizzaro et al., 2005; Van Toor et al., 2008; Imbaya et al.,\n2018).", "word_count": 294, "start_char": 14068, "end_char": 15957}

However, none of the control measures has been validated as such that even\nunder increased chemical spray cycles; they experience massive losses due to aphids (Zekeya et\nal., 2018).\nMost local farmers use chemical means by use of synthetic pesticides for example Rocket, dudu\nacelmectine... Resource poor farmers on the other hand use cultural methods like crop rotation,\nremoving of infested plants, and proper disposal of plant debris at the end of season (Retta et al.,\n2015). The other control is use of biological control method. This method is potentially a very\nbeneficial tactic to develop the biological control agents (living antagonists-natural enemies:\npredators, parasitoids and pathogens) are considered as one possible solution to most tomato pests\nOztemiz, 2013). This strategy offers a more sustainable and less expensive alternative to chemicals\n(Vivan et al., 2003; Bale et al., 2008). Use of garlic extracts and rabbit urine is a cheap, valuable,\nsafe and environmentally friendly alternative for insect pest management (Shiberu et al., 2018).\nThese plant extracts naturally contain pest repellant attributes which have the ability to repel or\nkill the insect pest at all stages including eggs, larvae, pupae nymphs and adults. However, in\nUganda the using of these garlic extracts and rabbit urine to control pests such as aphids on tomato\nhas not been fully explored yet there is still a need to improve crop protection against these pests\nand in the same way reducing the use of inorganic pesticides (Shiberu and Getu, 2018).\n\n1.3 Statement of the problem\nTomato has a lot of importance however, its production is threatened by destructive pests (Zekeya\net al., 2018).

For example, in the case of\naphids, the economic losses range from 50-100% yield loss in other countries depending on the\ntomato variety (Zekeya et al., 2018). The pest has been observed on tomatoes and other Solanaceae\ncrops as well as the Brassica family crops in Uganda,\nCurrent management of tomato pests has been based on inorganic pesticides such as Belt Expert,\nAbamectin, Dudu acelamectin which are very expensive and not affordable to resource poor\nfarmers. The use of synthetic pesticides is also complicated by the fact that most farmers do not\nobserve the prescribed dosages and pre-harvest intervals which results into chemical residues in\nthe fruits affecting export trade and posing health risks to the consumers and drastic effects on the\nenvironment (Klieber et al., 2015; Retta et al., 2015). In addition, biopesticides also have the\nability to provide some required nutrients for plant growth hence making pesticides a better option.\nLimited studies have however been conducted to determine the effect of rabbit urine and Garlic\nbiopesticide on aphid control. Therefore, eeffective pest control is no longer a matter of heavy\napplication of limited insecticides, because continuous use of pesticides promotes development of\ninsecticidal resistance in the target pests, pest resurgence, emergence of secondary pests, affects\nnon-target insects’ species, affects the environment through air pollution, killing of beneficial\norganisms, as well as causing human health complications such as skin cancer.\nChemical pesticides are also quite expensive to most of the farmers which has led to\neconomical loss due to the reduced yields.\nFarmers mostly affected are the horticultural farmers in this case (Dilawar Hussaina, 2023).\nTherefore, the growing need for alternative, environmentally friendly methods of aphid control.\n(Sarwar, 2015 and Grzywacz et al., 2010)\n\nTherefore, this study aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of rabbit urine and Garlic biopesticide\nagainst aphid control and determine the pest infestation on different growth stages of tomato\n1.4 Objectives\n1.4.1 Main objective\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of garlic, extract and rabbit urine as natural alternative of controlling aphid\ninfestations on tomato plants.\n1.4.2 Specific objectives", "word_count": 367, "start_char": 17803, "end_char": 20233}

During this study\n\nAsole tomato variety was used and a homemade organic pesticide acquired from a rabbit urine and\ngarlic extract was also used as a pesticide during this experiment.\n1.7 Significance\nTomato growing is one of the most promising areas for horticultural expansion and development\nin Uganda (MAAIF, 1998). The biggest tomato producers are the districts of Mbale, Mpigi, Hoima,\nMbarara, Wakiso, and Mukono. Uganda produces 38,234 metric tons of tomatoes per year\n(FAOSTAT 2016) of which about 3,000 small-scale farmers grow fresh vegetables including\ntomatoes for export while more than 20,000 small-scale farmers grow vegetables particularly\ntomatoes for income (Sonko et al., 2005). Since the tomato aphid is threatening the tomato growers\nin Uganda, the plant extracts can provide an alternative control, it is important to evaluate their\nefficiency. The findings of this study will contribute to improved management of the tomato pests\nwhile protecting the environment, reducing the risks associated with use of synthetic insecticides\nand reducing the cost of controlling the pest. This will improve farmers’ incomes and their\nlivelihoods through increased yields and safety of the tomatoes for consumption while protecting\nthe environment.\n1.8 Justification\nTomatoes are a good source of iron and contain lycopene, an antioxidant that may protect against\ncancer.

Detecting infested plants at an early stage, before visual symptoms appear, is crucial\nfor implementing effective management strategies and pest control measures to prevent the spread\nof diseases (Zee et al., 2001; Park et al., 2016).\nTomato production in Uganda contributes to economic development and poverty alleviation since\ntomatoes are a source of foreign exchange earnings, and also generates income locally for\neconomic growth (Andre et al, 2005). Since tomato production is reduced by pest infestation. Use\nof mechanical methods such as removal of infested leaves have been suggested but can only be\nsuccessful on very small plots. Inorganic pesticides are another alternative but the cost of these\npesticides makes tomato production non-profitable. Controlling aphids is not an easy practice\nalthough synthetic pesticides are apparently available for use. Effective pest control is no longer a\nmatter of heavy application of limited insecticides, because continuous use of pesticides promotes\ndevelopment of insecticidal resistance in the target pests, pest resurgence, emergence of secondary\npests, affects non-target insects’ species, affects the environment and human health (Sarwar, 2015\nand Grzywacz et al., 2010). Therefore, the use of alternatives including botanicals, bio-pesticides,\nand new generation synthetic insecticides is essential to growing healthy crops. The use of different\nbotanical insecticides such as a mixture concentration of rabbit urine and garlic extract to protect\nplants from pests is very promising because of several distinct advantages (Marbet and Aurea,\n2008). Insecticidal plants are generally much safer than conventionally used synthetic insecticides.\nIt prevents development of insecticide resistance. Botanical insecticides are used by small-scale\nfarmers at low cost or zero cost of extraction and are highly degradable. The use of natural and\neasily biodegradable crop protection inputs like a mixture of Rabbit urine and Garlic (Allium\n\nsativum) can be a useful component of an integrated pest management (IPM) strategy since the\ncompounds are known for their low toxicity against beneficial insects (Koona and Njoya, 2004).\nTherefore, tomato farmers urgently need a cheaper but effective alternative which can be easily\nacquired and home made such the these locally made garlic extract and rabbit urine since they are\nlocally available materials.", "word_count": 438, "start_char": 22662, "end_char": 25656}

Challenges faced in controlling some of\nthese pests particularly aphids as of this case by tomato farmers using garlic extracts and rabbit\nurine in tomato production in Uganda.\n\n2.1.1 Tomato production\nTomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) belongs to Solanaceae family. It is an important and\nremunerative vegetable crop grown around the world including Uganda for fresh market and\nprocessing. It is ranked as the third vegetable worldwide (Shiberu et al. 2018). Statistics currently\nshows that the production of tomato globally is at 177.04 million metric tons (FAOSTAT 2016).\nAnd Uganda produces 38,234 metric tons of tomatoes per year (FAOSTAT 2016). In Uganda,\ntomatoes are among the most important and prominent horticultural crops grown for both home\nconsumption, domestic market and for export. Production of tomatoes in rural areas of the country\nhas increased employment and improved farmers’ livelihoods (Kennedy, 2008). However, tomato\nproduction is threatened by the exotic invasive insect pest tomato leaf miner (T. absoluta) (Zekeya\net al. 2018).\n2.1.2 Aphids\nThe green peach aphid (Myzus persicae) is a major agricultural pest that is found worldwide.\nWhile the exact origin is debated, it is likely native to Asia, much like its favorite food source,\nthe peach tree. (Prunus persica)\n\n2.1.3 Origin and distribution of aphids\nThe exact origin of aphids is still under debate, but fossil evidence suggests they emerged\nsometime in the Permian period, roughly 299 to 252 million years ago. Their long evolutionary\nhistory has resulted in a vast array of species, with estimates ranging from 4,000 to 10,000\nHowever most experts believe the green peach aphid originated in Asia, like its primary host\nplant, the peach tree. The green peach aphid is now found almost everywhere in the world except\nfor areas with extreme temperatures or humidity. They are adept at travelling long distances by\nwind, storms, and even on young plants that are transported between locations. This explains\ntheir global reach and ability to survive in various climates. While they don't prefer greenhouses,\nthey can easily invade them, further contributing to their spread.", "word_count": 397, "start_char": 25435, "end_char": 28026}

Parthenogenesis: During warm weather, female aphids can reproduce\nasexually, giving birth to live young without needing a male (Shree et al., 2017). This allows for\nrapid population growth when conditions are favorable.\nWinged and Wingless Forms: Aphid populations often contain both winged and wingless\nindividuals. Winged aphids can disperse long distances to find new host plants, while wingless\naphids focus on feeding and reproduction. The specific duration of each stage can vary\ndepending on the species and environmental factors. However, the overall lifecycle can be\nremarkably fast, allowing for rapid population growth under ideal conditions. (Hughes et al.,\n2013 and (Balzan, 2015).\n\n2.1.5 Economic importance of Aphids in tomato production\nTomato production is in danger due to the invasion by green peach aphid (Zekeya et al., 2016).\nSeveral authors have consistently reported that, no effective control including use of chemicals is\navailable for farmers. (Nesreen et al., 2017). They pierce plant tissue with their needle-like\nmouthparts to suck out sap. This weakens the plant, stunts growth, and can cause leaves to curl or\nturn yellow and as they feed, aphids excrete a sugary substance called honeydew which h attracts\nants and promotes the growth of sooty mold, a black fungus that further reduces photosynthesis\nand weakens the plant. In severe infestations, aphids can even transmit viruses between plants,\nposing a significant threat to your tomato crop.\nTomato growing farmers in Africa are currently stranded due to lack of effective control options\nas even under increased spray cycles, they experience massive losses due to increased aphid\ninfestation levels (Zekeya et al.,2016).\nThis however has opened a new window for research and development of new and alternative\ncontrol measures. The most recommended and promising approaches include application of\nbiological control options such as parasitoids and nematodes (Alabern et al., 2013; and Arnaouty\net al., 2014), entomopathogenic fungi and bacteria (Keikotlhaile et al., 2010) and pheromone traps\nfor monitoring population as well as detection of their presence (Zekeya et al., 2016).\n2.1.6 Control of Aphids\nDifferent management options exist for aphids are already in place and these include use of insect\nchemicals, cultural methods, physical controls and biological methods (Retta et al., 2015)", "word_count": 428, "start_char": 27719, "end_char": 30551}

Reports\nshow the effect of chemical sprays mainly harming untargeted organisms as well as environment\nand not the Aphids (Klieber et al., 2015). The nature of infestation especially by the Aphids hiding\nunderneath the tomato plant leaves and resistance to different chemicals limit control efforts\n(Wilcockson et al., 2014).\nCommon chemicals that aphids have been reported to develop resistance are Cartap, pyrethroids,\norganophosphates, spinosad, Emamectin benzoate, Abamectin, chloride channel activators,\nbenzoylureas and diamide (Zekeya et al., 2016). Synthetic chemicals have serious drawbacks,\nincluding reduced profits from high insecticide costs, destruction of natural enemy populations\n(Campbell et al., 1991), buildup of insecticide residues on tomato fruits (Walgenbach et al., 1991)\nand in the environment and fundamentally the rapid development of insecticide resistance. Pest\nresistance has been reported to cause increased use of chemical pesticides applications against\nAphids in many parts of the world including Uganda (Roditakis et al., 2015).\nIn countries such as Tunisia, more than 18 chemicals were introduced during 2009-2011 for the\ncontrol of Aphids but none of them seemed efficient in solving the pest problem (Abbes et al.,\n2012). However, chemical pesticides are very expensive and are applied frequently to the extent\nthat most smallholder farmers in Africa cannot afford to purchase regularly (Zekeya et al., 2016).\n\n2.2.1 Use of plant extracts (Garlic)\nAllium sativum, commonly known as garlic, has been widely utilized in culinary practices and\ntraditional medicine for more than 4000 years. It possesses various beneficial properties such as\nantiseptic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, cardioprotective, and anticancer effects.

For instance, Gong et al. (2013) conducted a study on the impact of\n2% raw garlic straw extracts on root- knot nematodes (Meloidogyne incognita) in tomato plants.\nThe researchers observed that the garlic extracts inhibited the growth of nematodes and led to an\nincrease in tomato yield. Similarly, Jess et al. (2017) explored the potential use of garlic oil in\ncontrolling Megaselia halterata (a species of phorid fly) in commercial mushroom production. The\nresearchers found that low concentrations (ranging from 0.1% to 20%) of garlic solutions\neffectively repelled adult female M. halterata. A commonly recommended recipe for a garlic\nsolution involves using 25 grams of chopped garlic in 10 liters of water. This solution can be\napplied to the soil and plants, exhibiting effectiveness against various pathogens such as fungi and\nbacteria, as well as pests including mites, aphids, larvae of Lepidoptera, and small bedbugs\n(Ministerio de Agricultura. Servicio Agrícola y Ganadero, 2013). Garlic (Allium sativum L.) is a\nhighly effective plant-based bio-pesticide known for its ability to control seed-borne diseases. It\ncontains allicin, a compound that gives garlic its distinctive smell and taste while providing\nbiological properties. Studies have shown that garlic possesses insecticidal and fungicidal\nproperties, making it effective against pests like mites, ticks, nematodes, and worms. These\ncharacteristics make garlic a valuable resource for pest management and disease control in\nagriculture and veterinary applications. Therefore, the appropriate use of eco-friendly microbial\npesticides can be engaged in recreation of sustainable organic crop production by providing a\nstable pest management program.\nBiological control method is potentially very beneficial tactic to develop (Savinoet et al., 2012).\nThe biological control agents (living antagonists-natural enemies: predators, parasitoids and", "word_count": 323, "start_char": 32290, "end_char": 34573}

This strategy offers a more sustainable and less expensive alternative to chemicals\n(Vivan et al, 2003; Bale et al., 2008).\n2.2.3 Rabbit Urine\nRabbit urine has been used as a natural pesticide for centuries, and there is some scientific evidence\nto support its effectiveness against aphids. Studies have shown that rabbit urine can repel aphids,\nreduce their egg-laying ability, and even kill them outright because of it’s Components\nRabbit urine contains several components that are thought to be responsible for its insecticidal\nproperties. These include:\nAmmonia: Ammonia is a pungent gas that can repel aphids and other insects. It can also damage\ntheir delicate respiratory systems.\nUrea: Urea is a nitrogen-rich compound that can disrupt the hormonal balance of aphids and other\ninsects. It can also interfere with their ability to reproduce, it as well dehydrates the aphids when\nin close contact (Diana Kemunto,2022)\nCreatinine: Creatinine is a waste product of muscle metabolism. It is not directly harmful to aphids,\nbut it can make rabbit urine more attractive to beneficial insects, such as ladybugs and lacewings,\nwhich prey on aphids.\nSeveral studies have explored the insecticidal properties of rabbit urine and garlic individually.\nRabbit urine diluted with water at a ratio of 1:10 has been shown to effectively control aphids on\nkale plants (Petrović et al., 2013). Rabbit urine is a readily available substances which has\ndemonstrated insecticidal properties. Rabbit urine contains high levels of nitrogen, which can act\n\nas a fertilizer and also possesses insecticidal activity (Petrović et al., 2015) Therefore Combining\nrabbit urine and garlic could potentially create a synergistic natural pesticide with enhanced\ninsecticidal efficacy against aphids.\n\nCHAPTER THREE\n3.0 Methods and materials\n3.1 Experimental site\nThe experiment was carried out in Mukono district at Mukono at Kyawambogo village from\nJanuary 2024 to March 2024.

The study examined the effects of\ndifferent doses of garlic extract and rabbit urine concoction on various parameters, including plant\nheight, damage to leaves per plant, Number of aphids and number of flowers. The treatments with\ngarlic extract and rabbit urine concoction exhibited positive effects on most of parameters, with higher\ndoses demonstrating greater efficacy. The results showed the potential of garlic extract and rabbit urine\nconcoction in improving tomato crop yield and economic returns for farmers. Based on the findings,\n\n5.2 Recommendations.\nSince this experiment only focused on one dry season, its recommended that the rabbit urine and\ngarlic extract concoction can be used for many other seasons because in a rainy season the aphids\ncan be washed away. Other parameters such as yield per plant and overall yield can also be taken\ninto consideration in order to tell if the concoction affects the yields of these tomatoes in any\nway.
