In particular high levels of BOD5 and COD in the waste water\neffluent pose significant risk on aquatic life through the depletion of dissolved\noxygen, therefore treating the effluent to the acceptable permissible limits\nis essential for the health of the ecosystems. The study involved assessing the\nuse of wood chips activated carbon in the treatment of the waste water\neffluent from the Doko waste stabilization pond and the research involved\ncharacterization of the waste water effluent in both the wet and dry seasons\nand the mean values of BOD5 and COD in the effluent for the dry season were\nfound to be 172.3mg/l and 269.7mg/l and 129.1mg/l and 217.8mg/l for the\nwet season and these were higher than the recommended NEMA standards of\n50mg/l for BOD5 and 100mg/l for COD, the study also evaluated the\neffectiveness of activated carbon in waste water effluent treatment where\nits adsorption behavior was described by the Langmuir and Freundlich models\nand the Freundlich model was the best fit for the adsorption of BOD5 and COD\nby activated carbon. The adsorption process demonstrated maximum\npercentage reductions of 75.6% for BOD5 and 72.4% for COD in the dry season\nand 80.3% for COD, 82% for BOD5 for the wet season bringing the BOD5 and\nCOD values to the NEMA acceptable discharge standards demonstrating the\npotential of wood chips activated carbon in waste water effluent treatment.\n\nii\n\nDECLARATION\nI, KHARONO MARY NORINE, hereby declare that the content of this report is\noriginal and has not been submitted either wholly or in part for the\nattainment of any academic qualification at any institution or university.

Effluents are released into\nsurface waters but if inadequately treated, they introduce microbial and\nchemical contaminants into public water ways negatively impacting river\necosystems and overall water quality (Bessong et al.,2009). Therefore, it is\nessential for wastewater treatment systems to ensure the release of highquality effluents into the environment. In many developing countries, waste\nwater treatment is often inadequate due to rapid urbanization and population\ngrowth that results into high hydraulic loadings affecting the capacity of the\nsystem and the overall design retention time (US EPA., 2009). This is one of\nthe challenges experienced here in Uganda in regards to waste water\ntreatment as some of the effluents discharged do not meet the NEMA\nstandards for discharge of effluent on land or into water.\nIn Mbale, there two separate sewer networks, one discharges into the\nNamatala waste stabilization Pond and the other discharges into the Doko\nwaste stabilization pond. The waste water from Republic Street, police\nbarracks, NWSC offices is treated at the Doko waste stabilization pond and its\neffluent is discharged into the Nashibiso stream. This accounts for the high\nlevels of pollution into the stream as it’s the immediate point source of\npollution (Wolukawu., 2023). Pollution of the Nashibiso stream as a result of\neffluent discharge from the Doko waste stabilization pond has been a major\nconcern (Mafabi., 2023) as the people within the neighborhood areas rely on", "word_count": 255, "start_char": 13344, "end_char": 15011}

The effluent is discharged into the\nNashibiso stream and this accounts for the high levels of contamination to the\nriver (Wolukawu., 2023), and this overtime affects the water quality and the\naquatic life. The BOD5 and COD values of the water from the stream during\nthe dry season were found to be 116mg/l, 170mg/l respectively, this affects\nthe quality of the water and also possess risk on aquatic life (Mafabi., 2023).\nHigh BOD5 and COD levels indicate a significant presence of organic loads, this\naffects the receiving ecosystems through the depletion of dissolved oxygen\n(Sharma., 2021). The purpose of this study is to assess the use of activated\ncarbon from wood chips in the reduction of BOD and COD from wastewater\neffluent, wood chips activated carbon has a large surface area, is highly\nporous, the pores on the surface of the activated carbon are of different\nshapes and sizes and this helps to create numerous active binding sites and\nthis helps in reducing BOD5 and COD in the waste water effluent.\n\n1.3 STUDY OBJECTIVES\n1.3.1 Main objective\nTo assess the use of wood chips activated carbon in the treatment of the\nwaste water effluent from the Doko waste stabilization pond\n\n1.3.2 Specific objectives\n1.

The availability of cavities\nor spaces and pores on the activated carbon are vital for the adsorption\nprocess (Danish and Ahmad., 2018), the pores formed are of different sizes\nand shapes which help to form numerous active binding sites which are free\nfor binding with the incoming atoms and molecules, these active binding sites\nincrease the adsorption capacity for the organic molecules present in the\nwaste water effluent because as the organic molecules are sticking and\nbinding onto the wood chips activated carbon their concentration in the\neffluent decreases and this results into a reduction in BOD and COD\nconcentration ( Alsubhi et al., 2020).\nThe use of wood chips activated carbon demonstrated the potential of\ntreating the waste water effluent to reduce the BOD and COD levels from the\nwaste water effluent as a percentage reduction of BOD and COD for the dry\nseason were 75.6% and 72.4% and for the wet season a percentage reduction\nof 82% and 80.3% for BOD and COD was achieved which shows the potential\nof wood chips activated carbon in the treatment of the waste water effluent.", "word_count": 310, "start_char": 18312, "end_char": 20203}

The study aimed at how to treat the wastewater\neffluent from the Doko waste stabilization pond to reduce on the COD and\nBOD concentration and ensure the effluent meets the set standards of 50mg/\nand 100mg/l for BOD and COD respectively before it's discharged to ensure\nsafety of aquatic life (Farhadian et al., 2019). Wood chips are one of the\nwastes generated daily from various wood work operations like making chairs,\nbeds, cupboards, doors, windows, these wood chips in large quantities their\ndisposal may become problematic (Mallakpour et al., 2021). Therefore, the\nstudy looked at how to ensure the health of the public and that of the aquatic\nlife through the use of activated carbon from wood chips to reduce BOD and\nCOD from the effluent to improve on the quality of the water in the Nashibiso\nstream, to make it safe for use and to also restore the aquatic ecosystem.\n\n1.7 SCOPE OF THE STUDY\nGeographical scope\nThe Doko waste stabilization ponds are located in Mbale city south of\nKampala road.

Its main components include suspended solids, biodegradable\ndissolved organic matter, inorganic substances, nutrients, heavy metals and\nharmful pathogens. The organic fraction typically consists of substances such\nas detergents, proteins, carbohydrates, fats and soaps. Inorganic elements\ninclude toxic heavy metals like cadmium and mercury. If these contaminants\nare not properly treated, they pose serious threats to the environment and\npublic health.\nWastewater treatment is done as a way of ensuring environmental health,\nhowever, the discharge of sewage effluent which does not meet the effluent\ndischarge standards has increased over the years due the increase in\nurbanization and industrialization and this slows down the objective of\nensuring environmental health (Shon et al., 2006).\nGlobally, recent studies provide an estimate of waste water production and\nmanagement and (Jones et al., 2021) provides an approximation of about\n359.5 billion m3 annually, where about 63% of the waste water is collected\nand 52% of the waste water is treated and this shows that 48% of the\nwastewater is untreated and this calls for more technologies and ways on\nhow the waste water is treated and effluents properly discharged (Jones,\nVliet and Bierkens., 2020). For the waste water that is treated there exist\nstandards at which the final effluent from the treatment should meet before\nit is discharged, in Uganda much as wastewater effluent discharge\npermissible limits exist, ensuring compliance to the standards is not done\n\nefficiently and this often leads to discharge of effluents which do not meet\neffluent discharge standards.\n2.1 Characteristics of waste water\nKnowing the characteristics of waste water is crucial because it guides the\neffective management, treatment and design of a treatment system. The\ncharacteristics vary based on its source for example municipal, industrial\n(Welch and Naczk, 1992). The most used characteristic parameters are,\n1. Chemical oxygen demand and biochemical oxygen demand, they provide\nan understanding on the quantity of organic matter present, BOD\nrepresents the biodegradable organic matter and COD represents total\norganic matter.\n2. pH and electrical conductivity are indicators of ions in the waste water.\n3. Heavy metals and Inorganic salts which are indicators of Industrial\npollution.\n4. Nitrogen and phosphorus, these are nutrients when discharged cause\neutrophication.\n2.1.1 Types and Sources of waste water\n1. Domestic waste water, this is waste water that is discharged due to\nhuman activities, waste water from toilets essentially consists of organic\nmatter, domestic waste water from kitchens, bathrooms and the daily\ndischarge varies depending on for example the hygiene conditions and\nthese waste waters contain organic matter and also products such as\ndetergents and phosphate.", "word_count": 445, "start_char": 22814, "end_char": 25786}

It\ncontains both fecal matter and urine.\nBrown water, contains fecal matter, flush water minus urine, this mainly\napplies to urine diverting toilets.\n2.

Anaerobic ponds\nAnaerobic ponds are normally 2-5m deep and receive raw waste water and\nthey store solids which settle at the bottom as sludge. Anaerobic ponds do\nnot have dissolved oxygen and the microbial population consist of anaerobic\nmicroorganisms. The organic matter in the influent is broken down through\nfermentation.

In the facultative ponds,\ntreatment occurs in different zones that's to say, the anaerobic zone, the\naerobic zone.\nAn aerobic zone is present at the upper layers of the pond because of the\navailability of oxygen from the photosynthesis of algae and wind aeration, in\nthis zone organic matter is broken down aerobically, the aerobic portion of\nthe pond helps to guard against the release of odors and enables break down\nof the pollutants by the aerobic bacteria. Deeper in the layers the oxygen is\nnot present and this constitutes the anaerobic zone where the at the bottom\nthe settled suspended organic matter is broken down anaerobically (Dwivedi.,\n2022).\nIII.

Their primary purpose is to remove pathogens and they\nalso play a notable role in removing nitrogen and phosphorus although they\ncontribute to some extent to BOD reduction.\nThe ponds maintain good oxygen levels throughout their depth due to the fact\nthat they receive lower organic loads than anaerobic and facultative ponds\n(Dwivedi., 2022).\nThe final effluent comes from the maturation pond and it's discharged into\nthe Nashibiso stream.\n2. Constructed wetlands\nConstructed wetlands are engineered systems designed to mimic the natural\nfunctions of wetlands for the purpose of treating wastewater. They are\ntypically shallow basins filled with soil and planted with water tolerant plants\nlike reeds, these plants play a key role in the treatment process by enhancing\nmicrobial activity and facilitating the transfer of oxygen to the root zone.\nIn the context of wastewater treatment, constructed wetlands are often\nused after preliminary treatment stages like from septic tanks, waste water\ntreatment facility as the pretreated wastewater flows slowly through the\nroot zone and this way the pollutants are removed from the waste water\neffluent (Stanbury et al., 2017).\n3.

The activated sludge portion is continuously returned to the process\nwhich increases on the microbial population and activity and in this way the\nwaste water becomes treated.\n4. Trickling filters\nTrickling filters biological treatment systems sometimes called percolation\nfilters. The filter consists of a rotating distribution system that runs by\ngravity, here the microorganisms are not suspended in the mixed liquid but\nthey attach themselves on the fixed bed surface and form a layer of\nbiological slime that absorbs and consumes the waste, the slime consist of\nbacteria and the accumulating slime slides off the Individual rocks and is\ncollected at the bottom along with treated waste water.\n2.2.2 Conventional waste water treatment\nThis incorporates a number of processes for example, pre-treatment, primary\ntreatment, biological treatment, secondary treatment and disinfection.\na) Pre-treatment\nAs the waste water enters the treatment plants the large floating objects are\nremoved by the screens. The screens can be coarse of fine, the materials that\nare trapped are then removed and disposed off safely either in a landfill,\nincinerated or disposed off in areas designated to receive such wastes.\nb) Primary treatment\nThe screened waste water then flows to the primary clarifiers where the\nsuspended solids and floating objects are removed. what settles at the bottom\n\nis called primary sludge, there are other types of waste other than the\nsuspended solids for example soaps, oils, grease and these float on top to\nform scum which can be removed by the help of a skimmer.\nc) Biological treatment\nUnder biological treatment, the wastes are broken down biologically and here\ntrickling filters, activated sludge systems can be utilized, and waste is broken\ndown aerobically.\nd) Secondary treatment\nThe waste water then flows to the secondary sedimentation tanks where the\nactivated sludge settles at the bottom of the tank, the activated sludge can\nbe recycled back to the aeration chamber to increase the microbial activity\nand population, it can be used in biogas production or sent to the sludge\ndrying beds.\nDisinfection and discharge\nThe waste water produced contains pathogens and disinfection is done to kill\nthe pathogens present and mainly chlorine is used and after disinfection the\nwaste water effluent is then discharged.

During adsorption\nmolecules bind onto the solid surface or are held of the solid surface by the\nweak intermolecular forces of attraction.\n2.3.1 Types of adsorbents used\nActivated carbon, clay minerals, zeolites and these have proved to be\nefficient in waste water effluent treatment.\n2.3.1.1 Activated carbon\nActivated carbon refers to carbon rich substances characterized by a highly\ndeveloped internal pore structure. It its extensive surface area along with an\norganized network of micropores and meso pores contribute to its exceptional\n\nability to adsorb contaminants from the waste water effluent. Recognized\nworldwide as one the earliest and most extensively utilized adsorbent,\nactivated carbon is commonly employed in the treatment of both municipal\nand industrial waste water to reduce color, various organic and inorganic\npollutants (Liu et al., 2020).\n2.3.1.2 Types of activated carbon\nThe most common forms by which activated can be found include:\nGranular activated carbon, which is mainly used in fixed bed adsorption\ncolumns. Granular activated carbon can be prepared from hard materials like\nwood, coconut shell and granular activated carbon is mainly used in column\nadsorption units and they can be regenerated after use.\nPowdered activated carbon, this is mainly used when the pollutant\nconcentration in waste water is low as they can be clogged easily though they\nhave a high surface area for waste waters with high pollution loads for\nexample high levels of suspended solids, granular activated carbon is suitable\nas it reduces on the frequency of clogging and for waste waters with low\ncontaminants then powdered activated carbon is suitable (Tariq et al., 2022).\n2.3.1.3 Methods activation\n1. Physical activation\nPhysical activation is also referred to as thermal activation, it is widely used\nin the production of activated carbon. The first stage involves carbonization\nwhere the biomass such as wood chips undergo thermal decomposition at\ntemperatures between 400-600 ̊C, using the wood chips or any other material\nwithout treatment, it leads to the increase in organic matter after they\ndecompose, carbonization removes volatile compounds yielding a carbon rich", "word_count": 449, "start_char": 33670, "end_char": 36643}

This method yields activated carbon with well-developed porous\nstructure and is considered more environmentally friendly than the chemical\nactivation\n2. Chemical activation\nChemical activation involves treating the carbonaceous precursors with\nchemical activating agents such as phosphoric acid, potassium chloride, zinc\nchloride prior to thermal treatment. The method is particularly effective for\nbiomass rich in cellulose and lignin (Sumangala et al., 2021).\n2.3.1.4 wood chips activated carbon\nIn the selection of the type of tree species to be used for production of\nactivated carbon, it depends on its carbon content and cellular structure\nhardwood like eucalyptus have a complex cellular structure which produces a\nporous material as compared to soft woods. The wastes from the wood\nindustry are cheaper and available in large quantities. Besides Eucalyptus\nwood chips having a good cellular structure, the waste is plentiful by product\nof the wood industry. According to approximate analysis, raw eucalyptus\nwood chips have a fixed carbon content of 51.99% making it an excellent\nbiomass for the production of activated carbon (Moрoung.,2021).\nCarbonization and activation are key steps for activated carbon production;\nthey help in the determination of the surface properties and porosity of the\nadsorbent.\n\n2.4 Adsorption isotherms\nAdsorption is the mass transfer process characterized by the accumulation of\nsubstances on the surface of the adsorbate. The equilibrium relationship\nbetween the adsorbent and the adsorbate is typically described by the\nadsorption isotherms at a constant temperature. Accurately fitting\nexperimental data to various isotherm models is essential for identifying the\nmost suitable model for adsorption design.\nEquilibrium adsorption isotherms are critical in designing adsorption systems\nas they help assess the adsorption potential of activated carbon for specific\ncontaminants. A wide range of isotherm models exist and the most widely\nused adsorption isotherms used are Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption\nisotherms. The Freundlich adsorption isotherm assumes that adsorption takes\nplace in the multilayer while Langmuir adsorption isotherm assumes\nadsorption takes place in a monolayer (Rani et al., 2021).", "word_count": 373, "start_char": 36312, "end_char": 38900}

The BOD5 value deviations\nthroughout the day are mainly due to the increase in microbial activity which\nincreases the breakdown organic thus reducing the BOD5 (Badre et al., 2023).\nmorning\nafternoon\nevening\nBOD (mg/l)\nTime\nA graph of BOD against time\nBOD\n\nFigure 2: COD concentration variation with time\nAn average COD value of 269.7±4.2mg/l in the effluent was discharged into\nthe Nashibiso stream which was beyond the NEMA set standard of 100mg/l\nand this high COD value is mainly attributed to the reduction in the retention\ntime of the ponds this could be due to the increase in the hydraulic loading\nof the ponds affecting their design capacity and the design retention time\nthus reducing the efficiency of the ponds in effectively treating the waste\nwater effluent to the required COD values.\n\nFigure 3: pH variation with time\nCOD (mg/l)\nTime\nA graph of COD against time\nCOD\n8.2\n8.4\n8.6\n8.8\npH\nTime\nA graph of pH against time\npH\n\nA pH range of the effluent from the pond was between 8.3-8.7±0.1, the rise\nin the pH in effluent is mainly due to the dissociation of carbonate and bi\ncarbonate ions in the ponds which leads to the release of hydroxyl ions which\nleads to a rise in the pH values in the effluent.\n\nFigure 4: TSS concentration variation with time", "word_count": 382, "start_char": 53056, "end_char": 55278}
