This study assessed the use of waste engine oil (WEO)\nas an additive to reduce water absorption in sandcrete blocks. Laboratory experiments\ndetermined the physical and chemical properties of WEO and assessed its effect on the\ncompressive strength and water absorption of sandcrete blocks. The results showed\nthat WEO exhibits hydrophobic properties that help limit moisture penetration. The\noptimum proportion of WEO was found to be 0.5% by weight of cement which effectively\nreduced the water absorption by 20% and increased the compressive strength by 8%.\nHowever, higher concentrations of WEO (≥1.0%) weakened the blocks due to\ninterference with cement hydration process. These results suggest that incorporating\nWEO in sandcrete block production offers a sustainable and eco-friendly solution for\nreducing dampness while promoting waste recycling in construction.\n\nii\n\nDECLARATION\nI hereby declare that this is entirely my own original work, is not plagiarised and has\nnot been submitted to any other institution for assessment other than this University.\nSignature: ...................................................................\nRWOTBER RAYMOND\nS21B32/062\n\niii\n\nAPPROVAL\nThis is to certify that this report was compiled under my supervision and is ready to be\nhanded in to the Faculty of Engineering, Design and Technology as one of the\nrequirements for the degree of Bachelor of Science in Civil and Environmental\nEngineering at Uganda Christian University.\nMR.

It can even lead to problems like\nmortar fall from the affected areas, failure of affected building components and also\ncauses serious health effects to the humans (Vidyakar, 2019). Flooding, leakages, water\npenetration and construction water are major causes of dampness in a building. Surface\nefflorescence just above skirting/floor, dampness at the base of walls up to 1.5m in\nhorizontal band, softening and deterioration of plaster and blistering and flaking of\npaint are main symptoms associated with dampness (Delgado et al 2016). This not only\ncompromises the aesthetics of a building but also structural integrity.\nTraditional methods for minimising dampness involve the use of synthetic chemicals,\nsilicone sealants, and bitumen coatings. While effective, these solutions may have\nnegative environmental implications, raising concerns about sustainability in building\npractices. As the construction industry increasingly prioritizes eco-friendly solutions,\nalternative materials and methods.\nIn Uganda, sandcrete blocks are favoured for their affordability, ease of manufacture,\nand versatility (Acayo, 2020). They are commonly used in walls, fences, partitions, and\nvarious structural elements across residential, commercial, and industrial applications.\nHowever, their porous nature leads to a relatively high-water absorption capacity,\nmaking them susceptible to dampness. To solve this problem, incorporating waste\nmotor oil into the sandcrete block mixture can help to reduce the levels of absorption\nof water by the sandcrete blocks. Waste motor oil is hydrophobic due to its non-polar", "word_count": 411, "start_char": 11076, "end_char": 14202}

This\nlowers the overall water absorption capacity of the sandcrete blocks but also provides\na way for recycling waste products, contributing to environmental sustainability.\nThe incorporation of waste motor oil could also enhance the durability and longevity of\nsandcrete blocks, making them a more viable option in regions prone to moisturerelated issues. This research proposes the use of waste motor oil in sandcrete block\nproduction as a sustainable and environmentally friendly solution to minimize dampness\nin sandcrete blocks hence contributing to both sustainable construction practices and\nwaste management efforts.\n1.2 Problem Statement\nIn Kawempe division, the sandcrete blocks made by local manufacturers have a highwater absorption capacity which makes them more susceptible to dampness (Ahumuza,\n2020). Sandcrete blocks also known as concrete blocks which are used for masonry have\na water absorption capacity of 18.7% which is higher than the required capacity of 12%\nset by UNBS (US 596:2017) and the average compressive strength of 2.396 Nmm2 was\nbelow the 3.5 Nmm2 value considered in practice (Acayo, 2021). This dampness may\ncause structural failure and mortar deterioration hence compromising on the durability\nand structural integrity of the block. The area under study is a low-lying area hence has\na high-water content in the soil so use of these blocks can reduce the durability of the\nstructure. Different methods to combat the dampness levels in sandcrete blocks are\nbeing used today like use of bitumen coating, synthetic chemicals like Dr. Fixit, silicon\nsealants and these may be harmful to the environment.

Incorporating\nwaste motor oil into sandcrete blocks can help address the issue of high-water\nabsorption. Therefore, mixing petrol and diesel engine oil together for use in sandcrete\nhelps to optimize the viscosity of the oil ensuring that there is even distribution of the\noil in the sandcrete as well as enhancing the hydrophobic effect to minimize dampness\n(Hamad et al., 2003). Used diesel engine oil is thicker and can provide long-lasting\nwaterproofing while used petrol engine oil is lighter and is better in absorption. When\nmixed together, they balance distribution and durability. Waste motor oil is\nhydrophobic, meaning it repels water. This hydrophobic nature is attributed to the fact\nthat waste motor oil does not contain any charge and is non-polar (Warden, 2017).\nWhen waste motor oil is mixed with the cement used to produce sandcrete blocks, it\nreacts with the cement physically through adsorption to form a gel-like substance\n(Chen, Qin & Lau 2021). The incorporation of waste motor oil into concrete results in\nthe formation of air bubbles due to the similarity with air entraining agents (Yaphary\net al., 2020). These voids of air reduce internal pressure within the concrete by creating\ninterconnected chambers that lead to the volumetric expansion of the water molecules\nduring freezing (Sun et al., 2020).

This is by using waste motor oil which is a waste from motor\nvehicles and has adverse effects on the environment when disposed of improperly that\nis mixed in the sand and cement mixture to make them be able to have the required\nwater absorption capacity as stated by the UNBS.\n1.8 Scope of study\nKawempe division is located in the northern part of Kampala, the capital city of Uganda.\nIt includes various neighbourhoods and suburbs such as Bwaise, Komamboga, Kawempe\ntown, Kisaasi, among others. The area of study is 0.3741880N, 32.5910370E in Kisaasi.\n1.9 Time scope\nThis research is expected to be carried out from October 2024 to March 2025.\n\nCHAPTER TWO: LITERATURE REVIEW\n2.1 Blocks\nBlocks are rectangular elements used in construction for building walls, making\npavements as well as other structures for masonry works. A block is typically a unit\ncomposed of materials such as concrete, cement or other aggregates (Campbell, 2024).\nBlocks can be assembled using mortar, adhesives or even by interlocking mechanisms.\nTheir production is classified according to different types and sizes which may differ\ndepending on the time and region, and are often manufactured in bulk quantity.\nA block can also be defined as a fundamental building material typically available in a\nrectangular shape and manufactured from materials like concrete or cement (Singh,\n2022). Blocks serve as essential components in construction projects, offering\nversatility and structural support.\n2.2 Classification of blocks\nClassification of blocks based on type and size. They can be classified as below;\n2.2.1 Solid blocks\nThese are blocks made of solid concrete only and are typically used in load-bearing\nwalls where structural strength is required (Smith, 2018). Fully solid blocks are often\nused for projects like paving where stability and durability are crucial. Solid blocks are\nmore stable than hollow blocks and are suitable for load-bearing applications (JK\nCement, 2024).", "word_count": 414, "start_char": 18646, "end_char": 21260}

They are commonly used in non-load-bearing walls and\npartitions (Jones, 2019). They are further classified in grade depending on their density;\n1. Grade A: These blocks have a minimum density of 1500 kg/m3 and are used\nin load-bearing walls (BigRentz, 2021).\n2. Grade B: These blocks have a density of less than 1500 kg/m3 and they are blocks\nare also used in load-bearing walls.\n3. Grade C: These have a density greater than 1000 kg/m3 and are used in nonload-bearing walls. They are lighter due to the holes and can be useful when\nrunning wiring or piping.\n2.2.3 Common sizes of sandcrete blocks\nDifferent blocks have different sizes and these sizes determined by their grade most of\nthe time. They vary since different wall sizes are needed for different purposes like\nload bearing walls, partitioning walls and retaining walls among others. Table 2.1 shows\nthe different common sizes of concrete blocks used.\nTable 2.1 Common sizes of block used\nLength(mm)\nWidth(mm)\nHeight(mm)\nSource: (Alpha Sand, 2024)\n\n2.3 Raw materials\n2.3.1 Cement\nCement is a binding agent used to bind many different construction materials. It is an\nessential ingredient of concrete and mortar due to its adhesive and cohesive properties.\nIt is mixed with water to form a paste that binds aggregates or crushed rocks with sand\n(Hasan, 2010). Calcium, silicon, iron and aluminium compounds are closely ground to\nform a fine powdered product called cement. Different types of cement used in\nconstruction today;\n1. Non-Hydraulic cement. It is formed through the reaction of powdered cement\nwith water and can be used in all types of construction even underwater\nconstruction projects since it sets and becomes adhesive due to carbonation.\n2. Hydraulic cement. This is the most common and used cement. Hydraulic cement\nlike Portland cement has always been a preferred choice for architects,\nengineers and constructors majorly due to its ability to harden quickly.\n2.3.2 Sand\nSand is a granular material made of finely divided mineral particles. It has different\ncompositions but it is defined by its grain size. Sand grains are smaller than gravel and\ncoarser than silt. Sand can also be referred to as a textural class of soil or soil type i.e.\nsoil containing more than 85 percent sand-sized particles by mass (Plant and Soil\nSciences eLibrary, 2022).", "word_count": 433, "start_char": 21044, "end_char": 23721}

The type of sand used in building construction is typically referred to as\nconstruction sand or building sand. There are different types of sand used in\nconstruction;\n1. River Sand: This is naturally occurring sand collected from beds of rivers. It is\nfine, rounded and has a smooth texture hence making it ideal for concrete and\nplastering (Deloney, 2023).\n2. Pit Sand: It is found in deep pits. It is coarse and angular and is often used in\nconcrete due to its binding properties.\n3. Manufactured Sand (M-Sand): It is made by crushing hard granite stones, M-sand\nis a substitute for river sand. It has a rough texture and angular which helps in\nbonding in concrete (Admin, 2021).\n2.3.3 Gravel\nGravel is a loose collection of small rock fragments formed through the natural\nprocesses of weathering and erosion or produced in quarries where larger rocks like\nsandstone, limestone and basalt are crushed (Charles 2024). With particle sizes ranging\nfrom 2 mm to 60 mm, gravel has various colours, textures, and types. It has a vital role\nin construction being essential for concrete production and asphalt mixing in road\nconstruction.", "word_count": 296, "start_char": 23412, "end_char": 25187}

They are resistant to fire and pests making them\ndurable and long-lasting (Homes, 2016).\nSandcrete blocks have various sizes, shapes and finishes hence offering flexibility in\ndesign and construction. They are used in load-bearing and non-load-bearing walls,\npartitioning walls, retaining walls and other structural elements.\nSandcrete blocks are pre-casted and readily available allowing for fast and efficient\nconstruction. They are easy to handle, transport and install hence reducing labour costs\nand construction time.\nSome sandcrete blocks are designed with built-in insulation improving thermal\nefficiency and reducing energy costs for heating and cooling buildings. Additionally,\nconcrete has inherent thermal mass properties that help to regulate indoor\ntemperatures.\nSandcrete blocks provide excellent sound insulation reducing noise transfer between\nrooms and entrance from external sources. This is beneficial in residential and\ncommercial buildings where acoustic comfort is very important.\nSandcrete blocks have inherent fire-resistant properties offering protection against fire\nspread and minimizing damage in the event of a fire.

This moisture can cause issues such as mould growth, efflorescence\nand deterioration thereby reducing the durability of the structure.\nSandcrete blocks are more brittle compared to other building materials making them\nprone to cracking during transportation or construction. This brittleness increases the\nrisk of wastage during handling.\nSandcrete blocks may offer substandard thermal and sound insulation properties. This\nresults in higher energy consumption for heating or cooling the interior and less\nsoundproofing which is less desirable for residential applications.\nIn areas with high moisture or flooding, sandcrete blocks can erode over time if not\nadequately waterproofed leading to reduced durability and a need for frequent repairs.\nSandcrete blocks often vary in quality due to inconsistent manufacturing processes\nparticularly where they are made by hand. Differences in the sand-cement ratio and\nimproper curing can lead to weak and non-durable blocks\n2.6 Dampness in blocks\nWhen building a concrete structure, moisture is among the most important factors since\nit hydrates the cement and helps in the curing process. However, once the building is\nconstructed and inhabited, moisture can be harmful to the walls and the occupants\n(Administrator, 2024).

These automobile engines\ncannot run on just any oil and “current design philosophies largely owe their feasibility\nto engine oils tailored to the demands of advanced engine design”.\nWaste motor oil refers to “petroleum-based or synthetic oil” that has been used and no\nlonger fit for its original use due to the presence of impurities like dirt, metal scrapings,\nwater or chemicals (US EPA, OLEM, 2018). These impurities accumulate during normal\nuse rendering the oil ineffective. As a result, this used oil must be replaced with new\noil to ensure proper functioning of engines and machinery.\nThis used oil is considered hazardous waste due to its dangerous properties. A single\nlitre of waste motor oil can contaminate up to one million litres of water hence posing\na significant threat to aquatic life and water quality. Moreover, if disposed of\nimproperly such as being left on the ground, waste motor oil can lead to severe soil\ncontamination (US EPA, OLEM, 2016).\nThe potential environmental impact of WEO in construction materials requires careful\nconsideration. Although the enclosure of WEO in concrete may reduce immediate\nleaching risks, long term studies are limited on the stability of PAHs within the cement\nmatrix. Research by Omoregie et al. (2024) shows that some additives could assist in\nimmobilising heavy metals from oil contaminated construction materials. However,", "word_count": 303, "start_char": 27849, "end_char": 29765}

While WEO poses environmental\nrisks, its enclosure in the sandcrete blocks could offer a containment solution provided\nlong-term stability is confirmed.\n2.8 Chemical composition of waste motor oil\nUsed motor oil comprises of both high and low molecular weight hydrocarbons, various\nadditives, metals and other compounds. It consists of hydrocarbons in different\nquantities i.e. 73-80% Aliphatic Hydrocarbons, 11-15% Monoaromatics, 2-5% Diaromatics\nand 4-8% Polyaromatic Hydrocarbons. Lubrication additives make up about 20% of the\noil including Zinc Diaryl, Molybdenum oils Disulfide and Zinc Dithiophosphate (Cvengroš\net al. 2017). Notably, PCBs which have been linked to health risks and environmental\nconcerns, were historically used in transmission fluids but are no longer utilized in new\nmotor due to their potential to form dioxins (Cvengroš et al. 2017).\nUsed motor oil is notably rich in Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), with\nconcentrations significantly higher than those found in new motor oil because of the\naccumulation of PAHs during engine operation (Akintunde et al., 2015). The\nPolyaromatic Hydrocarbons content in used motor oil can also be modelled basing on\nthe common PAH compounds each contributing equally to the overall composition. The\nimpact of PAHs on the environment and human health is well-documented emphasizing\nthe importance of proper management and disposal of used motor oil to mitigate\npotential risks (Armioni et al., 2024).

The\nsignificance of these studies arises from the construction of substantial concrete\ninfrastructures for oil-related activities where the impact of crude oil on concrete's\ncharacteristics remains largely unexplored. It is known that mineral and fuel oils do not\ncompromise mature concrete as they lack components that chemically interact with\nset cement (Creaney, 2022). However, vegetable and animal oils pose a greater threat\nthrough chemical reactions with cement hydration products hence leading to expansive\nsoap formation and matrix degradation (Staroń, 2023) and this presence of vegetable\nor animal oils can actively deteriorate concrete with documented instances of\nstructural damage. The degree of harm oil inflicts on concrete is influenced by its\nviscosity oils with higher viscosity pose less risk to concrete integrity. Conversely, oils\nwith lower viscosity such as diesel and kerosene have viscosity less than 6cP at 21°C\nand are prone to seep through concrete potentially leading to significant leakage from\nstorage tanks (Pradena and César, 2021).

Introduction of waste motor oil into concrete leads to formation of many air\nbubbles due to its likeness to air-entraining admixtures. These air bubbles reduce the\ninternal pressure in the concrete by providing “interconnected chambers for the\nvolumetric expansion of water molecules during freezing” (Sun et al., 2020). The\nconcrete containing waste motor oil will improve significantly under freezing-thaw\ncycles hence more durable. When waste engine oil is compared together with new\nengine oil, waste motor oil contains very little amount of dirt which has impurities that\nare inactive and react with the cement physically by adsorption to coat the sand and\nhence fill the free pores in the concrete mixture leading to increase in the strength of\nthe concrete (Poon and Chan, 2007). These effects of waste motor oil in concrete\naccount for the improved performance of concrete when the proper dosage levels of\nwaste motor oil are used.\n\n2.11 Knowledge gap\nPrior investigations have explored the utilization of used cooking oil in concrete showing\nthat it increases the slump value of concrete (Salmia et al., 2013). Incorporating waste\nmaterials like “oil drill cuttings” treated by thermal desorption has been shown to\nproduce sandcrete with reduced levels of water absorption, increased density and\ncomparable compressive strength to control samples demonstrating the potential for\nreuse of waste materials in improving sandcrete properties (Khedaywi et al., 2022).\nInitially the blocks have been dipped into the waste motor oil but this causes the block\nnot to bond with the mortar easily when used due to its oily surface. This therefore\nprompted the incorporation of waste motor oil into the sandcrete mix so that the final\nproduct can easily bond with the mortar during construction.\nThe practical aspects of incorporating WEO in block production is not yet largely\nexplored and the difference in oils from different sources is expected to yield different\nresults in field applications. Compatibility of such blocks with standard mortars and\nfinishes should be established as the hydrophobic characteristics of oil could further\ncompromise the bonding strength and surface treatments (Bamigboye et al., 2023)", "word_count": 448, "start_char": 32632, "end_char": 35605}

It includes material collection, mix proportioning, sample preparation, curing\nand testing to assess the effects of WEO on the compressive strength and water\nabsorption capacity of sandcrete blocks.\n3.1 Material collection and preparation\nMaterials needed for the making of sandcrete blocks with waste motor oil are; used\nmotor oil, cement, sand, water and aggregate. This was done following the ISO 14001\nstandard for handling of waste materials and ASTM C140 for casting of masonry units.\nThe waste motor oil from petrol car engines and motorcycles was collected from Shell\npetrol station garage in Wandegeya Kampala and from Kibalizi auto garage in\nWandegeya opposite Makerere small gate. It was collected in a 5-Litre jerrycan. This\nwaste motor oil was transported by vehicle to Kulambiro where three different smaller\nsamples of 500ml each were obtained and prepared to be taken to the laboratory for\ntesting. The balance was stored in a tightly closed container to prevent it from\ncontamination by external impurities. One sample was taken to Molecule Technology\nAfrica Limited Labs in Industrial Area opposite Uganda Foundry for testing of presence\nof contaminants. It was also tested for its viscosity, total acid number and stored at\nroom temperature.

Two bags of cement were bought.\nIt was transported by vehicle to Kulambiro where it was split into two parts i.e. half\neach weighing about 25kg and prepared to be used for mixing of the mix for making the\nblocks then taken to the laboratory for testing. A mold for making of the blocks was\nobtained from Divine Concrete in Najeera and was used to make the sandcrete blocks.\nIt was of dimensions 150 mm x 200 mm x 400 mm commonly known as a 6-inch block.\nThe sand was obtained from Waswa transporters and suppliers in Kyanja and then\ntransported to Kulambiro where it was kept. 4 kg were then obtained and taken to the\nlab for grading to know if its suitable for the sandcrete blocks.\n3.2 Determining the physical and chemical properties of WEO\n3.2.1 Contaminant analysis (ICP test)\nWaste motor oil often contains contaminants such as heavy metals like Lead and Copper\nwhich have various negative effects on the environment as well as the quality of the\nsandcrete blocks. This is done to ensure that the waste motor oil used has little or no\nharmful heavy metals in it.

The acquisition process is then started via the software (Qtegra)\nand the data is monitored as the samples are analysed. When the samples are all\nanalysed, the data is saved and checked for consistency to ensure accuracy. It is then\nexported for review and reporting.\n3.2.2 Viscosity test (ASTM D445)\nViscosity refers to the resistance of a liquid to flow under gravity. This test is carried\nout to measure the oil’s flow as this greatly influences its ability to bond with the\ncement and sand during mixing of the materials to make the sandcrete blocks.

It\nwas tested for using a Hydrometer.\nA sample of 500ml was obtained and stored under room temperature.

Low strength can lead to structural failure over time. This test ensures\nthat that the blocks have enough strength to support both the dead loads of the\nstructure and meet the building guidelines. It is measured using a universal testing\nmachine. Strength is measured in Pascal.\nAfter curing the blocks, they are allowed to dry for 24hours under air and the\ndimensions of the block are measured to ensure that they are uniform. The weight of\nthe block is measured to and the mass of the block is recorded. The compression testing\nmachine is set up and the block inserted ensuring that the load is aligned with the\ncentre of the block in order to apply the load evenly. The load is gradually applied at\nabout 0.25Mpa per second and it is applied until the block fails or cracks.

The\ncapillarity of the block when used in masonry unit will be assessed to find out if it\nactually resists dampness when used in a wall masonry.\nThe block is dried at 105°C in an oven to constant weight. A pan is filled with water up\nto 5mm and the block is inserted into the pan. The bottom of the block is submerged\nin water for about 24 hours. The level of water rise in the block is measured at regular\nintervals typically every 6 hours over a period of 24 hours. The rate of capillary rise and\nthe total water absorbed are recorded and analysed.\n\nCHAPTER FOUR: RESULTS AND ANALYSIS\nIntroduction\nThis chapter shows the results of laboratory tests conducted on waste motor oil and\nsandcrete block samples.

High lead level in waste engine oil is dangerous to\nindividuals, especially if it exceeds 50ppm as indicated by the EPA, because lead is a\nheavy metal that is detrimental to both people. High amounts of lead can induce lead\npoisoning leading to neurological, renal, and cardiovascular disorders (Navas-Acien et\nal., 2007). Lead-containing materials in construction can also leak lead particles over\ntime, affecting indoor air quality and causing health concerns (US EPA, 2014).\nLead concentration in the oil is lower than the EPA limits hence it is safe and friendly\nto use in sandcrete blocks because the end users are not exposed to excessive lead\ncontent, which might cause poisoning.

This viscosity combined with prolonged use shows that is has\nundergone degradation and has thickened over time due to the contaminants in it hence\nits overall characteristic. The WEO has a VI of 95 because it has degraded and during\ndegradation some of the additives become less viscous hence causing the oil to have a\nhigh viscosity index (Luo et al.).

The decrease\nin compressive strength is due to the effect of WEO with cement hydration preventing\nproper bonding within the concrete matrix. At lower concentrations i.e. 0.5% WEO this\neffect is less but as the percentage of WEO increases the impact becomes more hence\nreducing the structural integrity of the concrete. However, excessive WEO content\ndisrupts the cement matrix, a phenomenon consistent with findings by Sun et al.
