This study investigates the viability of algal\nbiodiesel as a supplement to liquid fossil fuels, leveraging Uganda's tropical climate.\nThree species of algae, namely Botryococcus braunii, Nannochloropsis sp., and\nChlorella vulgaris, were evaluated under optimised conditions for species\ncompatibility, lipid extraction yield, and biodiesel quality. Results indicated that\nChlorella vulgaris is the most suitable species for decentralized systems, as it\ndisplayed the highest growth rate (13.4 cm biomass on Day 12) and a moderate lipid\nyield (20–30%). Diethyl ether-isopropanol achieved the highest yield at 83.1% but\nposed safety concerns, while hexane-isopropanol represented the best compromise\nbetween viability and effectiveness. The biodiesel characteristics partially met\nASTM requirements; viscosity (2.82 mm2/s) and density (0.8335 g/cm3) were\ncompliant, but cetane values of 5.2 required blending with petrodiesel (B20). Algal\nbiodiesel is techno-feasible in Uganda, benefiting from low-cost open-pond systems,\ncooperative models at the community level, and the integration of wastewater\ntreatment to address energy poverty, promote environmental sustainability, and\nsupport a circular economy concept.\n\nii\n\nDECLARATION.\nI, Ashaba Marvin Aheebwa, hereby declare that this is my original work, is not\nplagiarised and has not been submitted to any other institution for any award.\n\nSIGNATURE ..............................

The fossil fuels\nresponsible for over 80% of the world's energy use face intense pressure for their\nenvironment-negating effects of greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, and\necological devastation. Poor developing countries like Uganda are even worse off\nsince they use fossil fuels, which use up foreign reserves and expose economies to\nthe vagaries of international markets. Uganda alone, for instance, uses over $6\nmillion per day in petroleum imports, yet nearly 76% of its rural population lacks\naccess to electricity and turns to firewood and charcoal as substitutes.\n(Development, 2023). This dependency fuels deforestation (2.6% annually) and\nadditional health crises since indoor air pollution produces 13,000 preventable\ndeaths annually. Such renewable energy options as algal biodiesel then turn out to\nbe essential interventions in such a situation, leading the way to energy\nindependence, Eco compatibility, and green economic growth. Algal biodiesel—a\nbiofuel composed of renewable energy obtained from oil algae microorganisms—\nproves particularly promising to tropical nations such as Uganda.\nCompared to other biofuel crops such as maize or soybean, algae will not experience\ncompetition with food crop production on non-potable land, seawater, or sewage\nwastewater. Uganda's sunny tropical climate, 20–30°C temperatures, and rainy\nseasons that follow are a perfect condition for algae to grow all year round. Locally\nsourced algae Botryococcus braunii and Chlorella vulgaris have been reported to be\n\nhighly productive in lipids under local conditions, and cost-effective open pond\ntechnology also possesses the same extent of infra-availability in Uganda.\nAdditionally, algae's CO2 fixation and growth potential on wastewater also possess\nthe same circular economy principle where wastes from farms and municipalities\nare employed to produce worthwhile energy resources. As an example, Kampala's\n120,000 m3/day of wastewater may simultaneously abate pollution and energy\npoverty to produce algae for biodiesel. Algal biodiesel is however as yet an uncapped\npotentiality in Uganda. Present research focuses on industrial-level, high-tech\nsystems that do not apply in decentralised, resource-poor environments. This\nproject bridges that gap by constructing localised, community-level systems that\ntake advantage of Uganda's natural strengths. (Branco-Vieira, 2020)\n(Milledge, 2014) Through local algal strain optimization and integration of indigenous\nknowledge into existing biotechnological pipelines, the project will put in place a\nmass-scale plan for biodiesel production. The project will ensure policy support,\nenable Uganda to comply with the Paris Agreement, and attain SDGs 7 (Affordable\nEnergy) and 13 (Climate Action).

The\nuse accelerates environmental degradation, e.g., greenhouse gases from combustion\nleading to respiratory illnesses, ozone layer depletion, and climatic change.\nTransportation and extraction of fossil fuels also pose threats of oil spillage and loss\nof biodiversity. The non-renewable nature of the resources also makes the Ugandan\neconomy vulnerable to price volatility, mismatch of demand and supply, and longterm energy insecurity. While the rest of the world is working to transition to\nalternative energy sources, Uganda does not produce a single unit of alternative\nenergy locally, making it vulnerable to world market tendencies and unsustainable\nenvironmental\ndegradation.\nPotentially\nrewarding\ndirections\ntoward\nthe\nachievement of the reduction of fossil fuel use include algal biodiesel research, as\nin the world's efforts by AlgaePARC, Algenol, and Sapphire Energy in the quest for\nspecies\noptimization,\ngenetic\nmanipulation,\nand\nmass\nculture\nsystems.\n\nAlthough such ventures show the potential of algal biofuels to reduce emissions by\n50-90% depending on fossil fuel, they too have strong challenges. Their high cost of\nproduction, technical complexity of lipid extraction and risk of contamination\nrestrict their suitability in constrained-resource situations such as is the case in\nUganda.

A period of approximately four months was used to conduct the study in the\nform of research on work by different scholars, along with data collection and\ninterpretation. This time frame was fairly adequate for data collection.\n1.6\nJustification.\nAlgal biodiesel can be an available, sustainable alternative using locally dominant\nalgae, in preventing dependence on volatile world oil prices. Uganda's\noverdependence on imported fossil fuel for more than $6 million per day is a source\nof economic vulnerability and environmental degradation.\nThe biodiesel of algae is embraced by the Renewable Energy Policy of Uganda as\nwell as by international pledges such as Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and\nParis Agreement. Algal biodiesel promotes the accessibility of clean energy (SDG 7),\nclimate action (SDG 13), and clean water (SDG 6) from the treatment of wastewater.\nThe conversion of biodiesel eliminates indoor air pollution from charcoal with an\nimpact of 13,000 premature deaths a year and the public's health improves. Through\nthe creation of local research partnerships and promotion of Uganda as a global\nleader in sustainable biofuels, the project builds national innovation capacities and\noffers solutions to pressing socio-environmental challenges.\n\n1.7\nSignificance of the study\nProduction of biofuels by algal culture offers economic stability through rural job\ncreation, since open pond cultivation and low-tech harvesting are particularly viable\nin the infrastructure and environmental conditions of Uganda.

(Brenna, 2010)\n\nCHAPTER TWO: LITERATURE REVIEW.\n2 Introduction\nA lot of literature has been written about the subject of algal biodiesel production.\nThis section reviews this literature and its scope is confined to algal biodiesel\nproduction. The review is presented in such a way that highlights research gaps,\nwhich further justifies the present study.\n2.1\nStrain selection:\nThree strains were selected and these are Botryococcus braunii, Nannochloropsis sp,\nand Chlorella vulgaris. (Nwokoagbara, 2015)\n2.1.1 Botryococcus braunii.\nBotryococcus braunii is a colonial green microalga of high hydrocarbon production\npotential, namely in the form of botryococcenes. It exists as pyramid colonies in a\nsophisticated extracellular matrix (ECM) involved in buoyancy and protection.\n(Demura, 2014)\nCulture Preparation:\n● Isolation: The cultures may be isolated from fresh water habitats of Uganda\nwhere B. braunii occurs naturally. Isolation is initially accomplished by using\nselective media that enhance its growth.\n● Nutrient Medium: Modified Chu 13 medium is generally used, providing simple\nnutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus to provide for growth.\n\nCulture Environment:\n● Light and Temperature: Maximum growth is with high light intensity (2000-\n5000 lux) and temperatures ranging between 20-30°C, which is favourable for\nUganda's tropical environment.\n● Aeration: There should be constant aeration to keep the cells suspended and\nallow nutrient uptake.\nMonitoring and Harvesting:\n● Growth Monitoring: Optical density can be monitored using measurements.\nChemical analysis can be employed to quantify hydrocarbon content.\n● Harvesting Techniques: Flocculation or centrifugation methods are commonly\nemployed for harvesting due to the thick cell walls that inhibit extraction.\n2.1.2 Nannochloropsis sp.\nNannochloropsis are lipid-rich and hence best suited for use in biodiesel. They are\nunicellular, small but aquatic in habitats and cultivated aseptically on freshwater.\n(C. Sanjurjo, 2024)\nPreparation of culture:\n● Isolation: As in the case of B. braunii, Nannochloropsis can be isolated from\nnature, i.e., natural water sources. Locally environment conditions-tolerant\nstrains should be utilized.\n● Medium Composition: The medium must contain sufficient nitrogen,", "word_count": 354, "start_char": 18245, "end_char": 20760}

It is utilized as nutritional supplements and biofuel feedstock. (Pantea\nMoradi, 2022)\nCulture Preparation:\n● Isolation and Maintenance: Isolation of culture can be achieved by using\n\nfreshwater ecosystems of Uganda. Cultures require a medium of high\nnutritional quality such as BG11 or Chlorella medium.\n● Supply of Nutrients: Adequate nitrogen and phosphorus must be supplied for\nhealthy growth.\nCulture Conditions:\n● Lighting Conditions: Chlorella vulgaris grows best in high light conditions\n(around 3000 lux) with 12 hours light/12 hours dark being the ideal\nphotoperiod.\n● Temperature Gradient: It could be cultivated best in the temperature range\n20-30°C, which suits the ambient temperatures of Uganda well.\nMonitoring and Harvesting:\n● Growth Monitoring Methods: Optical density may be checked periodically to\nascertain growth rates. Nutrient levels must also be checked to prevent\ndeficiencies.\n● Centrifugation and flocculation are routine procedures due to the fact that\nthe relatively thin cell walls of Chlorella make it easier to extract than B.\nbraunii.\nGrowth Medium:\nA modified F/2 medium slightly is used for the three organisms supplemented with\nextra nutrients if necessary.", "word_count": 341, "start_char": 20370, "end_char": 22758}

Their objective was to develop a process that not only\nyielded fuel but also facilitated the capture of greenhouse gases, thereby addressing\ntwo significant challenges. (Ziolkowska, 2014)\nAlgenol's primary technology involved specialized photobioreactors, within which\nthese modified algae were employed. A pivotal aspect of this process was direct\nethanol production (DEP), wherein the algae were engineered to secrete ethanol\ndirectly into the growth medium, simplifying the extraction process. (Ziolkowska,\n2014)\n● Algenol reported elevated productivities, with pilot plants achieving\nsubstantially higher yields of ethanol per acre in comparison to traditional\nethanol production from corn.\n● The company also emphasized the potential for carbon capture, suggesting the", "word_count": 344, "start_char": 22406, "end_char": 24841}
{"chunk_id": "DOC0027__00010", "doc_id": "DOC0027", "chunk_index": 10, "text": "process could mitigate greenhouse gas emissions.\nDespite the initial promise, Algenol encountered difficulties in scaling up its\ntechnology to commercial levels. The genetic modification of algae engendered\nsome public apprehension, and the actual yields attained in larger-scale operations\ndid not consistently align with initial projections. Ultimately, the company\nreoriented its strategic focus.\nWhile the direct ethanol production method may present complexities for immediate\nadoption in Uganda, the fundamental concept of employing algae for carbon capture\nand its subsequent conversion into a usable fuel source holds relevance. Uganda\ncould investigate simpler methodologies for carbon dioxide utilization from\nagricultural waste to foster algal growth, in conjunction with less intricate biofuel\nproduction pathways.\nSapphire Energy, USA.\nSapphire Energy, another United States-based company, sought to produce \"green\ncrude\"—a renewable oil analogous to petroleum—directly from algae. The company\ngarnered considerable attention and investment with the prospect of providing a\ndrop-in replacement for fossil fuels. (Perona, 2017)\n\nSapphire Energy employed expansive open ponds to cultivate algae at a commercial\nscale in the desert regions of the south-western United States. The company\nconcentrated on optimizing algal strains for elevated lipid production and\ndeveloping efficient harvesting and extraction methodologies. (Perona, 2017)\n● Sapphire Energy demonstrated the capacity to cultivate algae on a substantial\nscale in open pond systems.\n● The company produced notable quantities of algal oil, which was successfully\nrefined into various fuels, including gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel.\nNotwithstanding the technical achievements, Sapphire Energy confronted\nsubstantial economic challenges. The cost of producing algal oil at a competitive\nprice with petroleum proved to be a major obstruction. Consequently, the company\nscaled down its operations. Open pond systems, while less capital-intensive, are\nsusceptible to environmental variables and contamination.\nGiven its abundant sunlight, Uganda could potentially utilize open pond systems for\nalgae cultivation, similar to Sapphire Energy. However, it is imperative to assimilate\nthe lessons from Sapphire Energy's experience and prioritize cost-effective\nmethodologies, robust strain selection, and strategies to curtail water loss and\ncontamination.

Uganda must\ntherefore carefully evaluate the economic viability of large-scale open pond systems\nand implement strategies to mitigate the risks of contamination and water loss.\nSynthetic Genomics, USA.\nSynthetic Genomics, under the leadership of Dr. Craig Venter, directed its efforts\ntoward employing synthetic biology to engineer algae for enhanced biofuel\nproduction. Their approach involved modifying the genetic composition of algae to\naugment lipid yields and improve growth characteristics. (Rock, 2021)\nThis company used advanced genetic engineering techniques to create algal strains\nwith specific traits, such as increased oil content and faster growth rates. They\naimed to create \"super-algae\" that could produce biofuels more efficiently. (Rock,\n2021)\n● Synthetic Genomics successfully engineered algal strains with significantly\nhigher lipid content compared to wild-type strains.\n● They demonstrated the potential of synthetic biology to optimize algae for\nbiofuel production.\n\nWhile the potential of synthetic biology is immense, the development and\ndeployment of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) raise environmental and\nregulatory concerns. The long-term ecological impacts of releasing engineered algae\ninto the environment warrant careful consideration. The elevated water usage\nreported for certain strains also presents a challenge.\nUganda could derive benefit from advances in algal strain improvement.

Open pond systems provide huge cost\nadvantage in the capital expenses, reducing capital costs by a major factor of\napproximately 80% compared to high-cost photobioreactors.

The\nsystems also require huge tracts of land, which may prove to be a limitation in\npopulous regions.\nHowever, it should be possible to combine the simplicity of open pond systems with\nthe additional control offered by more advanced systems.

This is in the\nframework of the circular economy, wherein waste there is value, not waste to be\ndiscarded.\nIn Uganda, for example, the sugarcane industry produces enormous amounts of\nbagasse whose estimation is 4 million tons per year.\nThe bagasse can be utilized to generate carbon dioxide, a nutrient for algae\nproduction. The payoff could be huge: rather than burning this waste product,\nthereby releasing greenhouse gases into the air, one might utilize it to create algae,\nthereby enabling the creation of biofuel and in the process lowering carbon\nemissions.\nSimilarly, Kampala, Uganda's capital, produces a substantial amount of wastewater\nat around 120,000 cubic meters a day. The wastewater contains nutrients such as\nphosphorus and nitrogen that also happen to be some of the elements that nurture\nalgae growth. All the wastewater actually ends up flowing into Lake Victoria, where\nit kills and contaminates water creatures.\nHowever, utilization of this wastewater for algae cultivation will yield a twin\nbenefit: water gets purified, thereby conserving this valuable resource, and also a\nrenewable resource for biofuel is made available.

Scalability, environmental trade-offs, technical limitations,\nand conflicting local-global agendas are discussed in the review to argue the case\nfor context-sensitive innovation.\nScalability challenges: Bridging the gap between ambition and feasibility.\nIndustrial-scale facilities, such as those set up by AlgaePARC and Sapphire Energy,\nrequire up-front investment exceeding USD 5-10 million, which is cost-prohibitive\nfor most developing nations. Pilot-scale projects (such as Mbarara University's) are\nnot able to find funding to scale up, leading to a \"valley of death\" in which promising\ntechnology cannot survive through to implementation in society.\nThis affordability-scalability trade-off can be reduced using an incremental, modular\napproach.

Such excessive water\nuse might exacerbate an already acute scarcity in places like Karamoja where they\nhave issues in obtaining drinking water. This is a case in which an effort to address\none environmental issue (climate change) might have a consequence of worsening a\ndifferent environmental issue (water scarcity).\nTherefore, one of the long-term areas of focus for algae cultivation and biodiesel\ndevelopment will have to be the water-efficient algal strains and cultivation systems\nthat have some water efficiency built into them. This could involve selecting\nnaturally occurring algal strains from arid or semi-arid regions, or developing unique\ncultivation systems that have reduced loss of water through evaporation. It will also\nbe important to objectively consider whether any ecological issues could stem from\nalgae cultivation at a commercial scale and design and manage systems that will\nmitigate this from the outset.\nTechnical Barriers.\nThe extraction of lipids from algal biomass is yet another major bottleneck in algal\nbiodiesel production.

Hexane is a volatile and\nflammable compound that has to be carefully disposed of and handled.\nAlternatively, mechanical extraction processes like pressing, are a more simple\nextraction process but their extraction efficiencies are not as effective and range\nfrom 40% to 50% for typical cases. This inefficiency means that most of the energy\ncontained in algal biomass is being wasted in the extraction process and that there\nis a barrier to increasing the efficiency of algal biodiesel plants overall. This shows\nthat there is an urgent need for more sustainable and effective extraction options.\nEnzymatic extraction is a promising option for algal lipid extraction. Enzymes\ninterface with the algal cell wall to disrupt the cell wall and allow potential\nliberation of lipids. Enzymes are biological catalysts and are typically less damaging\nfor the environment and human safety than using dangerous chemicals. Enzymatic\nextraction is also a newer technology and there will be a need for research to help\nglean and develop the technology towards greater economic viability. Global vs.\nLocal Priorities.\nFinally, we must be mindful of the tension between global priorities (for example,\nclimate change mitigation) and local priorities (for example, energy access and\npoverty alleviation). Algal biofuels can contribute to global objectives with respect\nto reducing greenhouse gases, but the likelihood of algal biofuels adopted in\ndeveloping countries like Uganda will depend largely on their ability to meet local\nneeds and priorities.\nFor instance, mechanisms like carbon markets intended to reward global decreases\nin carbon emissions may not factor into the present needs of Ugandan communities\n\nstruggling to access basic energy. For example, Ugandan communities in need of\nenergy access may primarily interested in reliable and affordable access to energy\nfor cooking, lighting and powering their small businesses.\nAlgal biofuels can help address local needs, but only if their production is both\nsustainable, affordable, and culturally relevant. We should move from a top-down,\nexternally imposed solution focus, to a bottom-up, local community-participatory\nalgae biofuel project development and implementation approach.

The identified\nas most important parameters for influencing the choice of algal species chosen\nwere growth rate, lipid yield, bio-diesel yield and ease of culturing.\n●\nWeights were attached to the different parameters in order of importance. Lipid\nyield was given a weight of 10, growth rate a weight of 8, bio-diesel yield a\nweight of 7 and ease of culturing a weight of 6.\n●\nFor growth rate, the highest achieved volume for each species during culturing\nwas expressed as a percentage by dividing it by the total volume for each species\nmultiplied by 100. i.e.\nFor Chlorella Vulgaris.\nFrom Table, the highest achieved volume was 14820.6 cm3 on day 13 of observation\nand totalling all the volumes gave 135628.8 cm3.
