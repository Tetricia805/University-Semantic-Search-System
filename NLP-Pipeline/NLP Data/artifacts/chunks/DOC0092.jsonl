Inefficient financial management, combined with the uncertainty of the\nbusiness environment often led business enterprises to serious problems (Deresse and\nPrabhakara, 2012).The economic development of many countries has been established to depend\nprimarily upon the establishment of small and medium enterprises thus making them a catalyst\nfor economic development (Levy, 2015). However, improper financial management practices\nhave proven to be a main cause of failures in SMEs in terms of financial difficulty,\nmismanagements of funds and shortage of long term funds to meet the operating cost and capital\nexpenditure (Brigham and Ehrhardt, 2010).\nIn the global perspective, studies show that SMEs contribute over 55% of Gross Domestic\nProduct (GDP) and over 65% of total employment in high-income countries such as Britain,\nUSA, Canada and China (Asta and Zaneta, 2010). In middle-income countries, formal SMEs\ncontribute about 20% more to employment and GDP than the informal enterprises. SMEs are an\nimportant source of export revenues in some developing economies. For example, SMEs\ncontribute a larger share of manufactured exports in more industrialized East Asian economies\n(56% in Chinese Taipei, more than 40% in China) and in India (31.5%) compared to 1% in\nTanzania and Malawi.\nFurthermore, SMEs are a major source of employment, generate significant domestic and export\nearnings, contribute to the general health and welfare of economies, and are a key instrument in\npoverty reduction (Mephokee, 2010). For instance, SMEs constitute 99.7 % and 99 % of all\nemployers in the United States (US) and European Union (EU), respectively.", "word_count": 366, "start_char": 12600, "end_char": 15013}

For example, in Nigeria, the overall regulatory framework\nfor the SMEs was driven by specific SMEs acts which specify the key institutional linkages for\neffective coordination. In addition South Africa SMEs constitutes about 91 percent of formal\nbusiness entities, provides 61 percent employment and accounts for between 52 to 57 percent of\nSouth Africa’s GDP (Abor and Quartey, 2010).\nIn Kenya, the SMEs have been of great benefit not only to the economy but also to the society at\nlarge. The sector employs over 4.6 million people which was over 30% of all employment and\naccounts for approximately 75% of all businesses. The sector also contributes 18.4% of the GDP\nand accounts for 87% of the new job creation (Kiveu, 2013). In Kenya, there are 1.56 million\nlicensed SMEs and 5.85 million SMEs which are unlicensed. The manufacturing sector is yet to\nfully develop with the segment accounting for only 12% of all SMEs despite its potential in\nemployment creation and absorbing enormous number of people (KNBS, 2016).\nIn Uganda, micro, small, and medium sized enterprises are the engine of growth for the\neconomic development, innovation, and wealth creation of Uganda; they spread across all sectors\nwith 49% in service sector, 33% in the commerce and trade, 10% in manufacturing and 8% in\nother fields. Over 2.5 million people are employed in this sector, where they account for\napproximately 90% of the entire private sector, generating over 80% of manufactured output that\ncontributes 20% of the gross domestic product (GDP).\nFurthermore in Uganda, small and medium enterprises include food processing, drinks and\ntobacco, textiles, clothing and foot wear, sawmilling, paper and printing, chemicals, paint, soap\n& foam products, bricks &cement, metal products, plastic products manufacturing and furniture\nmaking among others (Uganda Bureau of Statistics, 2010). These play a significant role as they\nemploy 90percent of the active non farming population. They employ approximately 2,704,127\npeople, representing 56% of employment size. They are responsible for human resource and\nentrepreneurial development, poverty alleviation and improved quality of life, resource\nmobilization, business adaptability and sustainability (Tushabomwe-Kazooba, 2010).\nThe context of the study is of small scale business in Mukono Town like elsewhere in Uganda\noften face a lot of constraints and challenges in their operations.

They are often confronted with fierce local and international competition, lack\ngeneral skills in management, marketing and financial planning, limited access to information on\nmarket opportunities and sources of competitive technology. These constraints limit substantially\nthe productive capacity and efficiency of small scale businesses in Uganda to be competitive\nwithin the context of globalization.\n1.2 Problem Statement\nFinancial management practices have been recognized both in developing and developed\ncountries on its importance in coordinating organization’s functions enabling managers to\nunderstand the current financial position of the firm and capability in meeting future financial\nobligations (World Bank, 2014). This ensures that all the business transactions are undertaken in\nan orderly and well managed manner (Gormoma, 2014). Particularly, this was important to the\nSME sector where any mismatch in the financial practices is a negatively impact on the growth\nto a high extent.\nHowever, the SMEs still continue to underperform despite their huge role in economic\ndevelopment due to a negative trend that was portrayed by poor growth and development\nassociated with low profitability and low sales of the firm (Longenecker, 2010).This was\nevidenced by the annual budget report for performance of SMEs in the FY (2020/21) which put\nthe rate of performance at 58% against the acceptable national standard of 80%.Although various\nfactors have been established to determine how the SMEs performed, the influence that the\nfinancial management practices have not been well established.

It\nshows that financial management practices have the ability to influence growth directly.\nFinancial management practices contain three dimensions that was; capital budgeting technique,\nbudgetary control and financial leverage. The indicators for growth include; profitability and\nsales (George, 2010).\n\nCapital Budgeting Techniques\n• Net Present Value\n• Profitability index\n• Risk assessment.\n\nBudgetary Control\n• Set financial goals\n• Planning and Budgeting\n• Monitor the cash flow\nmanagement\n• Implement cost control\nmeasures\nRecord Keeping.\n• Maintain sales and\npurchase records\n• Track Inventory/Stock\n• Monitor Cash flow\n• Keep track of income and\nexpenses\n• Profitability\n• Sales\n\nGrowth\n\nCapital budgeting technique: This refers to the process of evaluating and selecting investment\nopportunities to allocate financial resources effectively. By using appropriate capital budgeting\ntechniques, such as discounted cash flow analysis or payback period calculations, a firm can\nmake informed decisions about which projects or investments to pursue. This helps in\nmaximizing returns and contributing to the growth of the company.\n\nBudgetary control: Budgetary control involves establishing financial targets and monitoring\nperformance against those targets. It helps in managing expenses, controlling costs, and ensuring\nthat financial resources are utilized efficiently. Through effective budgetary control, a firm can\nalign its spending with its strategic objectives, optimize financial performance, and support\ngrowth initiatives.\n\nRecord keeping: Record keeping refers to the systematic recording, organizing, and maintaining\nof financial transactions and information. Accurate and comprehensive record keeping enables a\nfirm to track its financial activities, monitor cash flows, and evaluate its financial health. It also\nfacilitates financial reporting, analysis, and decision-making processes. By maintaining proper\nrecords, a company can make informed financial management decisions that contribute to\ngrowth.\n\nThe indicators for growth mentioned in the statement are profitability and sales. Profitability\nmeasures the company's ability to generate profits from its operations, indicating efficiency and\neffectiveness in resource utilization. Increasing profitability is often associated with sustainable\ngrowth. Sales represent the revenue generated by selling products or services, reflecting the\ncompany's market demand and customer base.

(Brigham and Ehrhardt, 2013)\nargued that capital budgeting decision was vital to a firm’s financial well-being and are among\nthe most important decisions that owners or managers of a firm must make. Their rationale for\nthat belief was that capital budgeting decision often involves significant capital outlay to acquire\nfixed assets.\nAccording to Itivi (2011), his study adopted a descriptive research design and a census survey\nwas used where statistical data was collected quantitatively and qualitatively. A finding of this\nstudy was that capital budgeting process positively affects the growth of listed manufacturing\nfirms.\nIn a similar study conducted in South Africa, Olawale, etal (2010) found out that the use of\nsophisticated investment appraisal techniques such as NPV and IRR methods have a positive\nimpact on the profitability of firms.\nMunyao, etal (2013) sought to establish the relationship between capital budgeting techniques\nand growth of companies listed at the Nairobi securities Exchange. The objective was to find out\nthe relationship between capital budgeting techniques and growth of companies listed in the\nNSE. The study used multiple regression analysis to find the association between capital\nbudgeting techniques and the growth of companies listed at the Nairobi Stock Exchange. The\nfinding of the study indicated that there was a positive significant relationship between capital\nbudgeting techniques and the growth of the companies registered in the Nairobi Stock Exchange\nmethod.\nThis was in line with Nguyen (2014), who established that most SMEs evaluate and review their\ncapital projects prior to making any investment decisions. The study further found that though\nthe SMEs highly regarded their fixed asset management, they still had insufficient knowledge.\nThe study however focused entirely on the asset management practices without considering other\npractices that may be present and found out that capital budgeting has a positive impact on the\ngrowth of SMEs.\nAtieno, (2013) found out that most SMEs practiced financial planning practices by such as\nperiodical budget estimations, activity-based budgeting and financial analysis.

The current study\nalso confirmed the similar positive relationship on the SMEs in Kericho County.\nThis was in line with the similar study conducted by Munyao, (2010) who developed a\nforecasting model and tested for accuracy in obtaining predictions. The finding of the study\nindicated that model was significant. The study found out that all the four capital budgeting\ntechniques; payback method, accounting rate of return internal rate of return and net present\nvalue were being used by the companies listed in the Nairobi stock exchange and had a positive\nimpact on the growth of the firm.\nAccording to Nyambura, (2014), found out that all of the four capital budgeting techniques\nresearched on; payback period, net present value, accounting rate of return and internal rate of\nreturn were being used by companies listed in the Nairobi Securities Exchange and results\ndepicted that there was a correlation between the financial performance of banks and the capital\nbudgeting techniques employed.\nThis was in line with Chai, (2011), who evaluated the capital budgeting techniques for their\nrelationship with the firm’s financial performance that was to say Return on assets and findings\nshowed that Profitability index was highly related to the measure compared to other techniques.\nTherefore because of the inconclusive results got from the different scholars and researchers, the\nresearcher tends to find out the relationship between capital budgeting techniques and growth of\nsmall and medium enterprises.\nIn a study conducted by Odhiambo (2016) in Kenya, it was found that SMEs that utilized\nsophisticated capital budgeting techniques had higher growth rates compared to those that did\nnot. The study emphasized the importance of incorporating tools such as NPV, IRR, and\ndiscounted cash flow (DCF) analysis in the capital budgeting process to improve investment\ndecisions and promote growth.\nA study by Ogachi (2018) in Nigeria examined the relationship between capital budgeting\ntechniques and SME growth. The findings revealed that SMEs that employed techniques such as\nNPV, IRR, and payback period experienced higher growth rates and profitability.

A regression was also carried out to establish the relationship between the\nReturn on Equity and the budgeting independent variables. The research findings were that the\nbudgeting practices that are common among the firms are; budget planning, budget participation,\nand budgetary sophistication. Therefore the study found out a positive effect of budgeting on the\ngrowth of the firms.\nPlayer (2010) investigated on how budgeting affects the performance of SMEs in China. He\nreviewed the budgeting process in business firms and performance measurement in SMEs and\nfound out that more formal budgeting planning stimulates greater growth of sales returns in\nSMEs, clear and well spelt budget goals improve budgetary performance of institutions, a higher\nlevel of budgetary complexity results in a lower profit growth of SMEs, more formal budgetary\ncontrol leads to a higher growth of profit in the organizations and a greater budgetary\ninvolvement leads to better managerial performance. Medium-sized firms achieve higher profit\nand growth than small firms and state-owned enterprises achieve better non-financial\nperformance than small firms. Therefore in the study, it was found out that budgeting has a\npositive effect on the growth of SMEs in China.\nThis was furthermore in line with Onduso, (2013) who conducted a study using the statistical\npackage for social sciences as an analyzing tool and also regression model which was adopted to\ndetermine the association between dependent and independent variables. His findings revealed\nthat, financial performance as measured by ROA is influenced by the use of budgets and\ninfluences of management. The research also revealed that the use of budgets positively affects\nthe growth of the businesses\nMbugua, (2013) studying a sample of 60 companies using a cross-sectional research design\nconcluded that aspects of budgeting practices such as budget planning and budgetary\nparticipation have a positively significant effect on the revenue collection efficiency of water", "word_count": 435, "start_char": 34085, "end_char": 36947}

The paper also revealed that most people in the industry were not aware of such\ntechniques and even those who were aware did not use them effectively. Therefore, the study\nconcluded that budgetary planning tools has a positive impact on the growth of the registered\npublic service companies in Kenya. However, the studies consist of inconclusive findings.\nAccording to Koech, (2015),the sample size was 50 respondents and were the head of the finance\ndepartment. He used both primary and secondary data and used a descriptive analysis to mainly\nsummarize the data collected. His results showed that there was a positive significant\nrelationship between growth in manufacturing companies and the three variables (planning,\nmonitoring and control and participative budgeting).\nThis was in line with the same study conducted by Pimpong, and Laryea, (2016) that wrote a\npaper in the International Journal of Academic Research and Reflections about budgeting and its\nimpact on financial performance of non-bank financial institutions in Ghana. Their findings\nrevealed that, there was a positive relationship between budgeting and firm performance. The\nfurther portrayed that, the firms made use of established budget processes to a greater extent and\nthat budgeting coordination has a positive relationship on firm performance. Therefore because\nof these inconclusive results got from the different scholars and researchers, the researcher tends\nto find out the gap between budgetary control and growth of small scale enterprises.\nYartey and Amankwah-Amoah (2020) conducted research in Ghana and examined the\nrelationship between budgetary control and SME growth.

Financial records, for example the sales day book (sales journal), purchases day book\n(purchases journal), cash receipt book, cheque payments book, petty cash book, general journal,\nnominal ledger, debtors’ ledger and creditors’ ledger must be kept and maintained in a sound\naccounting system (Maseko & Manyani, 2011). Records’ keeping in the financial management\nof enterprises was very crucial. Accounting records furnish substantial information about the\nvolume of business, such as how present and prior volumes compare, the amount of cash versus\ncredit sales and the level and status of accounts receivable. In addition, good accounting records\nhelp to accomplish controlling expenses. Accounting records detail the amounts owed to\nsuppliers and other creditors so that the businessman or woman can plan the availability of cash\nto meet your obligations. Such records also provide information regarding expenditures and\nallow him or her to establish controls over them. It is important to be aware of expense\nrequirements and how they relate to the overall picture (Gordano, 1991).\nKeeping accurate and up-to-date records was vital to the success of any business. The business\nmust realize that records kept will be one of the most important management tools it possesses\nand, therefore, it should be allocated due importance. The business owner is looking for the\nmaximum return from their investment and the maintaining of good records is part of that\nequation. Good records keep the business individual on toes and enable him or her to monitor\nevery situation (Queensland government, 2011). Two common recordkeeping systems used by\nbusinesses and other organizations are the single entry bookkeeping system and the double-entry\nbookkeeping system. Single-entry bookkeeping uses only income and expense accounts,\nrecorded primarily in a revenue and expense journal. Single-entry bookkeeping was adequate for\nmany small enterprises. The primary bookkeeping record in single-entry bookkeeping is the cash\nbook, that allocates the income and expenses to various income and expense accounts. Separate\naccount records are maintained for petty cash, accounts payable and receivable, and other\nrelevant transactions such as inventory and travel expenses (Olukotun et al, 2012).\nDouble-entry bookkeeping requires posting (recording) each transaction twice, using debits and\ncredits. The double-entry bookkeeping is more advanced and requires accountancy skills to", "word_count": 449, "start_char": 39008, "end_char": 42061}

Expenses are recorded in a ‘General Ledger’ as they are incurred, rather than when the\nbill is actually paid; and when income is earned rather than when received. By recognizing\nfinancial obligations when they occur, not when they are paid or received, this overcomes the\nproblem of time lags, giving a truer picture of the financial position. The system can deal with all\ntypes of transactions and adjustments (Terry, 2009). Further, there are daybooks. A daybook was\na descriptive and chronological (diary-like) record of day-to-day financial transactions also\ncalled a book of original entry. The daybook’s details must be entered formally into journals to\nenable posting to ledgers. Daybooks include: sales daybook, for recording all the sales invoices\nand sales credits daybook for recording all the sales credit notes. It also includes purchases\ndaybook, for recording all the purchase invoices, purchases credits daybook, for recording all the\npurchase credit notes and cash daybook, usually known as the cash book, for recording all\nmoney received as well as money paid out. It may be split into two daybooks: receipts daybook\nfor money received in, and payments daybook for money paid out (Olukotun et al, 2012).\nIn a study conducted by Ayuk-Etang et al. (2016) in Nigeria, it was found that SMEs that\nmaintained accurate and up-to-date records experienced higher growth rates and financial\nperformance compared to those with poor record-keeping practices. The study emphasized the\nimportance of record keeping in providing reliable financial information, facilitating decisionmaking, and ensuring effective financial management.\nIn a study conducted by Mwangi et al.

Regarding capital budgeting techniques, studies\nconsistently show a positive relationship between the use of sophisticated techniques such as net\npresent value (NPV) and internal rate of return (IRR) and the profitability and growth of SMEs.\nThese techniques enable SMEs to make informed investment decisions, allocate resources\neffectively, and maximize returns. Similarly, budgetary control practices have been found to\npositively influence the growth and financial performance of SMEs. Effective budget planning,\nparticipation, and control mechanisms enhance resource allocation, cost control, and decisionmaking, contributing to overall business growth.\nFurthermore, record keeping has been identified as a crucial factor in the success of SMEs.\nAccurate and up-to-date financial records enable SMEs to assess their financial position, track\ntransactions, and make informed decisions. Proper record-keeping practices, such as using\naccounting software and maintaining detailed records, have been associated with higher growth\nrates and financial performance.\nOverall, the literature emphasizes the importance of financial management practices, including\ncapital budgeting techniques, budgetary control, and record keeping, in driving the growth and\nsuccess of SMEs. Implementing these practices enables SMEs to optimize resource allocation,\ncontrol costs, and make informed decisions, ultimately contributing to their long-term\nsustainability and profitability.", "word_count": 281, "start_char": 44146, "end_char": 46269}

Inclusive are the research design, the study area and the population, sampling\nprocedures, sampling size and composition, data collection methods, data processing data\nanalysis methods, data quality control, reliability and ethical consideration.\n3.1 Research design\nThe research design refers to the plan or scheme adopted by the study in conducting the study\nand addressing the various research questions. This study employed the descriptive research\ndesign in obtaining information about the financial management practices and growth of small\nand medium enterprises in Mukono Town, upper Kawuga. The descriptive research design\nenable done to obtain information concerning the current situation and other phenomena and\nwherever possible to draw a valid conclusion from the facts discussed (Creswell, 2008).\nMoreover, the research design enabled the description of the research variables while minimizing\ninterference by the researcher hence the most appropriate for the study.\n3.2 Population to be studied\nThe study population entails the group of items or elements that conform to certain specification\nand are of interest to the researcher (Mugenda and Mugenda, 2003). A population of 120 SMEs\nwill be studied and it will consist of cottage industries, whole sales and retail shops, and Super\nmarkets from the population using stratified random sampling as shown below;\n3.3 Sample Techniques\nThe researcher used random sampling while collecting data from a given sample.

Primary data was important for all areas of\nresearch because it gave accurate information about the results of an experiment or observation.\nPrimary data from the field will be obtained through researcher-administered questionnaires to\nselected respondents in order to get their opinions. Primary data helped the researcher in\ncollecting information for the specific purposes of their study (Mugenda&Mugenda, 2003).\nSecondary data refers to the gathering and handling of information by another person rather than\nthe researcher. The data obtained from published journal articles, e-books, journals and thesis.\nThis helps the researcher to know the historical perspective of the problem under investigation.\n3.6 Data collection method and instrument\nData collection used a methodical process of gathering and analyzing specific information to\nproffer solutions to relevant questions and evaluate the results.

Accordingly, capital\nbudgeting techniques helps small scale businessmen and women to allocate their limited\nresources efficiently. By comparing the potential returns of various projects, businesses can\nprioritize those that align with their growth objectives, ensuring that funds and efforts are\nfocused on the most promising opportunities. This was in line with Chai, (2011), who evaluated\nthe capital budgeting techniques for their relationship with the firm’s financial performance\nthat was to say Return on assets and findings showed that was highly related to the measure\ncompared to other techniques. Therefore because of the inconclusive results got from the\ndifferent scholars and researchers, it shows that capital budgeting encourages SMEs owners to\nthink strategically and consider the long-term impact of their investment choices. It ensures that\ninvestments are in line with the company's overarching growth strategy, helping SMEs stay\ncommitted to their long-term goals. Capital budgeting techniques aim to maximize profits by\nidentifying investments with the highest potential returns.\n5.1.2 To determine the impact of budgetary control on the growth of small and medium\nenterprise in the study context\nThe study established that there is a relationship between budgetary control and the growth and\ndevelopment of small businesses.

This financial prudence contributes to stability and resilience, vital for\nsustainable growth. This is because if there is monitoring money coming into and going out of\nthe business, the businessmen and women are able to plan for the businesses, they are able to\nknow the profitability of the businesses and are be able to cater for contingencies. When they\nmonitor, they are able to know what to add or what not to stock especially if its purchase is low\nand keeps on holding cash. When they carry out budgeting, they are able to monitor cash flow.\nThis was in line with the same study conducted by Pimpong, and Laryea, (2016) that wrote a\npaper in the International Journal of Academic Research and Reflections about budgeting and\nits impact on financial performance of non-bank financial institutions in Ghana. Their findings\nrevealed that, there was a positive relationship between budgeting and firm performance. The\nfurther portrayed that, the firms made use of established budget processes to a greater extent\nand that budgeting coordination has a positive relationship on firm performance. The budget\ntells when certain amounts of money to carry out activities will be needed, enables monitoring\nof income and expenditure and identifies any problems. Budgetary control techniques assist\nSMEs in making funding decisions. Whether it involves seeking external financing, reinvesting\nprofits, or utilizing internal funds, these techniques guide businesses in determining the most\ncost-effective and growth-oriented funding sources.\n5.1.3 To find out the influence of record keeping on the growth on small and medium\nenterprises\nThe study found out that record keeping influences the growth and development of small and\nmedium enterprises. This includes recording business transactions and it enables the\nbusinessmen and women to be able to track the income and expenditures of the business. By\nrecording the amount owed to suppliers and other creditors is also record keeping system, the\nbusinesswoman or man is able to establish the amount of cash against credit sales and the level\nand status of accounts receivable. When there are accurate and up-to-date records one is able to\ntrack of the finances in the business and preventing loss of money. This was in line witha study\nconducted by Ayuk-Etang etal. (2016) in Nigeria, it was found that SMEs that maintained\naccurate and up-to-date records experienced higher growth rates and financial performance\ncompared to those with poor record-keeping practices.

Record keeping has to be done in the proper way\neither using the single entry and double entry.\n5.2 Recommendations of the study\nThe study makes the following important recommendations in relation to the observations made\nduring the study;\n\n5.2.1. Businessmen and women should maintain clear records of all financial transactions\ninvolving personal capital. This documentation not only aids in financial transparency but also\nfacilitates accurate analysis of the effects of capital budgeting techniques on SME growth.\n5.2.2. Businessmen and women need to carry out record keeping for the growth and development\nof small businesses. This is including recording business transactions to be able to track the\nincome and expenditures of the business\n5.2.3 SMES should implement a robust budgeting process. Budgets help SMEs systematically\nmonitor and control their cash flow, enabling them to align financial resources with growth\nobjectives.\n5.3. Areas for further research\nThe study only investigated the impact of financial management and the growth of small and\nmedium enterprises. However, there are many more areas which may be studied and these\ninclude: Entrepreneurship skills and the performance of small scale businesses owned by\nwomen, business challenges affecting performance of small and medium entrepreneurial\ninitiatives in Uganda and the contribution of entrepreneurial personality to the performance of\nsmall and medium business among others.", "word_count": 273, "start_char": 72682, "end_char": 74574}
