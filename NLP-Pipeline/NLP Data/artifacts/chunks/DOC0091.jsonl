The study was based on the following\nstudy objectives: to investigate transparency under E-GP system, to investigate the efficiency of\nprocurement processes under the E-GP system and to analyze contract management under the E-GP\nsystem in the Ministry of Water and Environment (MoWE), Luzira Kampala, Uganda. The study\nadopted a descriptive cross sectional survey design where both quantitative and qualitative\napproaches where used. In this study, a total number of 74 respondents were expected but 49\nrespondents returned the survey instruments representing a response rate of 79.3%. The data was\ncollected using questionnaires and interviews and quantitative data analysis was done using Pearson\ncorrelation coefficients. Qualitative analysis was done using content and thematic analysis. Findings\nrevealed that there is a positive significant relationship between the E-GP system and transparency\nin purchasing at the Ministry of Water and Environment(MoWE) at r=271*. There is a positive\nsignificant relationship between the E-GP system and efficiency in public procurement processes at\nr=.271* and lastly, there is a positive relationship between contract management and the Electronic\nGovernment Procurement system at r=0.786. Conclusively: The adoption and implementation of the\nE-GP system in the purchasing procedures in the Ministry of Water and Environment(MoWE) has\nsignificant solved its underlying procurement issues by increasing transparency in procurement\nactivities in the entity whereby all the concerned stake holders clearly have visibility of\nprocurement information which is availed to them on the E-GP system. The system has notably\nincreased the efficiencies of the purchasing activities in the entity as it has significantly reduced\ncosts and enhanced the speed of the stages associated with purchasing in the entity. The E-GP\nsystem has reduced unnecessary administrative reviews hence increasing the rate at which projects\nand purchasing activities are executed in the entity.

It uses information and communication technology (ICT) to conduct the end-to-end\ngovernment procurement and disposal processes and activities online.\nProcurement refers to the legal acquisition of goods, works, and services in the right quality, and\nquantity at the right price from the right place and to the right place.\n\nEffective, sustainable, and ethical Public Procurement is one of the biggest challenges facing the\ngovernment of Uganda today. The researcher ascertained, gauged and measured the convenience\nand practicability of the E-GP Systems with regard to solving the precedent Public Procurement\nproblems in Uganda. The prevalence of underlying procurement problems highlighted the need for\nmore effective procurement systems that mitigate the risks associated with the Public Procurement\n\nThe independent variable of this study was the E-GP System that was incorporated on the 1st of July,\n2021, and rolled out by the government to eleven selected entities for example the Ministry of\nWater and Environment as a pilot project with hopes of solving various procurement problems and\nvices in the Public Procurement.\nPublic Procurement offers the largest business opportunities in Uganda with more than 60% of the\nnational budget spent through Public Procurement. Public Procurement like any other Public\n\nFinance management functionalities had undergone several reforms which resulted in the need for\nan electronic Government Procurement System.\n\nThe dependent variables of this study where the precedent procurement problems and vices in the\nPublic sector for-example conflict of interest, lack of transparency, rigged solicitations and bids,\npoor contract management, corruption and embezzlement of public funds, bureaucracy, increased\nlead times, bid rigging, poor distribution and so many more.\n\nThe E-GP System was inception-ed to tackle such problems that had held Uganda's Public sector\ncaptive for a very long time. Through this study, the researcher found out and reported how the E-\nGP System has lived up to its expectations and objectives.\n\nThe current situation was that the E-GP System was still undergoing a pilot study and it was very\ncrucial that this system was effective per its objectives other wise Public Procurement and Uganda's\nEconomy at large were destined for doom which was projected by the underlying Procurement\nproblems in the country.\n\n1.3 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM;", "word_count": 426, "start_char": 15978, "end_char": 18837}

Even after the incorporation of the E-GP systems in\nthe selected government entities, there is still a surge of Procurement problems in the Public sector\nfor example the misappropriation and embezzlement of iron sheets scandal that were not distributed\nto the rightful beneficiaries in the Karamoja region which called for reprimand-able action against\nthe Minister of Karamoja and her close associates. This showed that there is an existing gap that is\nbeing exploited and manipulated by unethical stakeholders for personal motives and benefits in\nPublic Purchasing entities. This study thus bridges the gap of such issues persisting even after the\ninception of the e-GP systems hence the need to establish a phenomenon study of the relationship\nbetween the E-GP System on solving precedent Public Procurement problems.\n\n1.4 GENERAL RESEARCH OBJECTIVES;\nThe long-term goal of this research was to bring to light how the E-GP System has solved the\nvarious issues concerning Public Procurement and to also point out the gaps, loopholes that the\nsystem hasn't fully addressed with regards to Public Procurement and also suggest possible\nsolutions to the shortcomings of the system if any is found.\n\n1.4.1 SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES.\nThe objectives of the study where;\n\n1.

It offers valuable insights into the benefits, challenges, and\nlessons learned from e-GP implementation. Policymakers, practitioners, and the researchers can\nutilize these findings to guide the effective adoption and utilization of e-GP systems in Uganda and\nsimilar contexts to solve various procurement problems.\nNineteen countries ‟ governments focus on how e-procurement helps to increase competition\namong the bidders and suppliers in public procurement processes. For example, the Republic of\nBangladesh introduced National e-Government Procurement (e-GP) in public tenders to eliminate\ncorruption and collusive bidding practices to ensure transparency and increase competition among\nthe bidders (Mahmood, 2010). Mahmood argued that if the government implement e-GP system this\ncould save public money and erase the political power in public bidding process. In Nigeria, the e-\nGP system has lead Nigerian public sectors to increase competition among bidders in public\nprojects and ultimately government can better select actual bidders. The e-GP system helps the\nNigerian government to eliminate the associated bottlenecks with existing system (Adebiyi et al.,\n2010). E-procurement technology performance of other countries like Bahrain, Norway, Italy,\nSingapore, Turkey, India, and Malaysia indicate that e-procurement helps to increase competition\n\namong bidders in public work and services. As a result, it helps the government to get the actual\nbidders at the right government project.\nCountries have been promoting open government strategies in order to improve transparency,\naccountability and citizens’ trust in the public sector. Open government is defined as “a culture of\ngovernance that promotes the principles of transparency, integrity, accountability and stakeholder\nparticipation in support of democracy and inclusive growth” (OECD, 2017[19]).", "word_count": 322, "start_char": 25193, "end_char": 27540}
{"chunk_id": "DOC0091__00009", "doc_id": "DOC0091", "chunk_index": 9, "text": "ountries have been promoting open government strategies in order to improve transparency,\naccountability and citizens’ trust in the public sector.O\n\npen government is defined as “a culture of\ngovernance that promotes the principles of transparency, integrity, accountability and stakeholder\nparticipation in support of democracy and inclusive growth” (OECD, 2017[19]).\n\nTwo of the pivotal advantages linked to the introduction of e-Procurement are transparency and\nintegrity. One of the driving forces creating the necessity for both is the issue of corruption\n(Neupane et al. 2012) given the substantial financial volume of public procurement (See section\n1). Especially the direct human interaction as well as the lack of options for monitoring enabled\ngovernment officials to get bribed or use their power for personal enrichment (Neupane et al.\n2012). Hence, centralizing procurement's within a publicly available electronic platform is hoped\nto create sufficient publicity to discourage contracting authorities from opening unnecessary\ntenders or hiding relevant information due to the elevated likelihood of detection (compare, e.g.,\nNeupane et al. 2012). Beyond fighting corruption, transparency, e.g., in terms of process\ntransparency, is also important to keep the public informed about decisions and performance—\nand through this to finally establish trust (Armstrong 2005). While the public as one, if not the\nmajor stakeholder of public administration has a right to be informed about procurement\ndecisions and performance, transparency also simplifies supplier participation and increases\ntrust.\nTrust is an important key facilitator of e-commerce (Kartiwi, 2006). Trust builds a good\natmosphere between government and bidders in the contracting process. The key\nmeasurement items of trust of public e-procurement are tracking and monitoring bidder’s\ninformation and documents, security of transactions, fairness in competition, and the user friendly\nnature of the commercial environment. (Evaluating the Anti‐Corruption Capabilities of Public e‐\nProcurement in a Developing Country, (Neupane-2012).\nAccess to public information has been the cornerstone of an open and inclusive government,\nbecause it is a fundamental element to reduce corruption and increase trust among citizens and their\ngovernments. (OECD, 2016) Access to information is also one of the targets of the Sustainable\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs) adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015. (United\nNations, 2015[21]) Proactive disclosure refers to disclosing relevant information without a prior\npublic request. This voluntary disclosure of information contributes to enhanced transparency and\n\nopenness, as well as avoiding the costs associated with the administrative procedures and fees to file\na request for information (OECD, 2016).", "word_count": 400, "start_char": 27172, "end_char": 29996}

The reuse of open government data enables any stakeholder such as citizens, civil\nsociety, and businesses to better understand and monitor governmental activities.\n\nE-procurement is considered as one of the most important thematic areas of the open government\nstrategy, and one of the most popular initiatives is open contracting, or publishing information\nrelated to public procurement in open and machine-readable formats.\n\nHowever, in cases where the opportunities for corruption are directly linked to the procurement\nfunction, e-procurement may be helpless, as in cases of entrenched or systemic corruption. This is a\nmuch deeper cultural problem and goes beyond opportunistic corruption. In such cases even if the\nrules are followed it does not guarantee there will be no corruption or that e-procurement will be\nconducted well. As a response to these problems the tendency, especially among countries newly\nintroducing e-procurement reforms, is to seek to impose very strict regulations, eliminating any\npossibility for the e-procurement agent to exercise his discretion. E-procurement, however, requires\nskill, training and experience.\nThe system has strengthened accountability by enhancing transparency and improved access to\ninformation from a central source. Because transactions are electronic, it is easy to trail, trace and\naccess data on the e-GP system for auditing, reporting obligations and accountability requirements.\n\nMost importantly, all tender opportunities are posted on the system and are accessible anywhere any\ntime. There has also been a good development for the business community because providers\nregistered on the E-GP get automated alerts about any new opportunities posted on the system.\n\nThe E-GP is also very secure for the bidders who want to do business with government. The system\nwill ensure that only authorized users will be allowed to access given data and information. This is\nbecause it provides for encryption of providers’ bid documents from the time of submission up to\nthe bid opening date and time.\n\n2.3 How the E-GP system has created efficiency in Public Procurement.", "word_count": 391, "start_char": 29772, "end_char": 32419}

The\nfindings of this review provide insights into the effectiveness of e-GP in enhancing transparency,\naccountability, competitiveness, and overall efficiency in public procurement processes.\n\nThe digital transformation of public procurement, the EU developed a phased nine-year (2014 -\n2023) public procurement reform to introduce a compulsory and fully transactional e-procurement\ntool, including modules on e-invoicing, e-notification, e-access, e-submission and other e-forms, as\nwell as a comprehensive reform to public procurement directives. According to the guidelines\npublished by the European Commission in 2014, the EU supports the process of rethinking public\nprocurement process with digital technologies in mind. This goes beyond simply moving to\nelectronic tools; it rethinks various pre-award and post-award phases. The aim is to make them\nsimpler for businesses to participate in and for the public sector to manage. It also allows for the\nintegration of data-based approaches at various stages of the procurement process.\n\nAccording to the EU, digital government is one of the key drivers toward the implementation of the\n‘once-only principle’ in public administrations – a cornerstone of the EU’s Digital Single Market\nstrategy. And with the adoption of digital tools, public spending should become more transparent,\nevidence-oriented, optimized, streamlined and integrated with market conditions. This puts eprocurement at the heart of other changes introduced to public procurement in new EU directives\nand introduces the notion that in the age of big data, digital procurement is crucial in enabling\ngovernments to make data-driven decisions about public spending.\n\nE-procurement systems increase efficiency in public procurement by introducing standardization,\nstreamlining and integration of processes and result in better value for money in the use of public\nfunds.

Columbia's primary goal is to clarify the procurement process and create an\neffortless site, yet at the same time they hope to make access available to potential bid\nopportunities. Moreover, the city strives to upgrade the level of competition by maximizing the\ninvolvement of bidders and contractors who aim to supply services to the city residents\n(\"Columbia's Purchasing Division\", 2013). In the case of Savannah, GA, a new e-procurement\nsystem was developed to streamline the flow of information between the municipal government,\nvendors, and resident users. The new system facilitates the e-procurement process by primarily\nenabling bidders to register online, receive bid notifications, and submit bids and view bid results\nonline. The e procurement website also offers an online question/answer session and includes sealed\nbids with lock box and bid encryption for safety and privacy concerns. The city places a great deal\nof emphasis on maintaining privacy and safety through the procurement process, which they argue\nenhances the value of their resident's tax dollars (\"E-Procurement\", 2013).\nThe city of Columbus, OH has established the Columbus Vendor Services, an e-government\ninitiative that provides a one stop online portal for potential bidders and vendors through which they\ncan register and compete for the city bids.

This factor has important contribution to reduce corruption in\npublic procurement. For example, Turkey introduces e-procurement project in 2002 and its main\nobjective was to achieve efficiency and regulate government procurement to obtain the best quality\nand performance among bidders (Bayraktar et al., 2009). Other countries‟ government such as Peru,\nPakistan, New Zealand, Italy, Fiji, and Hong Kong (China) obtain best quality of governance by\nimplementing e-procurement in government level. Consistency in procurement process and\naccessing real time information through e-procurement are important anti-corruption factors.

For example, the Singapore government using GeBIZ on-stop\ne-procurement portal which enhance transparency in government procurement, easy access to\ninformation, increase procurement efficiency, global reach among the bidders and suppliers, and\nincrease more competition among bidders (GeBIZ, 2005). The Costa Rican Government adopted\nThe Korean online e-procurement system called Mer-Link, which allows public agencies to acquire\ngoods and services through an electronic platform.

There are infrastructure issues too required to support\nelectronic procurement. This is a barrier against the anti-corruption aspect of the system.\n\n2.4 Contract management under the E-GP system.\n\nThe concept of electronic contract (also known as smart contract) was first introduced to the\ninformation systems research. It encodes obligation definitions among parties in an electronic form,\nwhich can be properly used for monitoring and observation. With the development of information\ntechnologies, electronic contracts were widely used in many different fields. For example, contract\nmanagement, which is used to execute and track an electronic contract via information systems with\nlimited human intervention.\n\nElectronic contract is a computer interpret-able technical specification, illustrated as a group of\nobligation definition that are fulfilled among involved parties, refused or waived when future event\noccurs.

It has also succeeded in reducing\nthe opportunities for corruption by applying procedural and transparency requirements. However, in\nthe case of systemic collusion and corruption, its eradication calls for a broader campaign and much\nwill depend on the government’s willingness to reform the attitude of civil society towards eprocurement. The situation may be exacerbated when, whatever the good intentions are, regulators\nimpose stricter regulations on the procurement officers in the name of anti-corruption. In extreme\ncases, this over-regulation erodes the ability of the procurement officer to exercise his discretion\nand have serious negative effects on public expenditure because it often condemns the government\nto inefficient and expensive purchasing. Care must be taken therefore to identify those opportunities\nin the e-procurement system that may be reduced through regulation and transparency. The systems\nneed to address the misuse of discretion and not seek to remove all discretion as procurement agents\nneed to be in position to make professional procurement decisions and regulation should not prevent\nthe exercise of that judgement.\n\nCHAPTER THREE METHODOLOGY\n\n3.1 INTRODUCTION.\n\nThis chapter consists of research paradigms, design, type of measurement, data\ncollection methods used, sources of data, sample size and sampling procedures, the\ndescription of the study area where data was collected, the reliability and validity,\ndata management and analysis.\n\n3.2 Research Design.", "word_count": 296, "start_char": 49916, "end_char": 51994}

According to\nKothari (2004), interviews are an oral interaction between the interviewee and interviewer on a\nparticular issue, interviews describe the life events and experiences of the respondents with respect\nto analysis of the significance of the portrayed phenomena. Interviews allowed the researcher to\ncollect qualitative data. Person to person interviews where conducted with a selected number of\nrespondents. Interviews where used because they have the advantage of ensuring probing for more\n\ninformation, clarification and capturing perceptions of the interviewees according to the study\n(Amin, 2005). Interviews also gave an opportunity to the researcher to revise some of the issues that\nhad been an over-sight in other instruments and yet are considered vital for the study. Interviews\nwhere used to explore in detail the study variables. Sekaran(2003) viewed interviews as one of the\nmost essential sources of data.

Questionnaires allowed\nthe researcher to obtain relative information from a large sample, because it gave respondents time\nto answer, allowed respondents to remain anonymous. Self-administered questionnaires where\nembraced by the researcher to collect data from Procurement Professionals and other stakeholders\nthat use the E-GP system at the Ministry of Water and Environment and its designated service\nproviders. According to Mugenda(1999), the questionnaire is considered the best way of collecting\ndata from respondents because it is easy to administer and obtain data within a short time from a\nlarge number of respondents. In this study, a self-administered questionnaire was used to gather data\n\nregarding the study. The researcher used a questionnaire as an instrument because the study is\nvirtually descriptive and the tool is an easy method of data collection. The questionnaire consisted\nclosed ended questions purely structured in nature whose variables where measured on a 5 point\nLikert scale (5 Strongly Agree, 4 Agree, 3 Not sure, 2 Disagree and 1 Strongly Disagree). The 5\npoint Likert scale was the most appropriate way to formulate the different questions for measuring\ndifferent items from different variables in this study.\n\n3.7.2 Interview Guide.\n\nAn interview guide is an instruments that guides the conversation between people where items are\nasked by the interviewer to elicit a response or statements from the interviewee (Basheka, Barifaijo\nand Oonyu, 2010:34). Interviews where conducted on a face to face basis with key respondents.\nInterviews where conducted with 4 Procurement Professionals, 3 Ministry of Water and\nEnvironment Officials and 3 Service providers of the Ministry. Interviews have the advantage of\nensuring probing for more information, clarification, different perceptions and capturing facial\nexpression of the interviewees, investigate issues in an in depth way, discover how individuals think\nand feel about a topic and why they hold certain opinions, investigate the use, effectiveness and\nusefulness of particular library collections and services (Amin, 2005). Interviews comprised semistructured and unstructured questions that where written basing on the variables of the study.\n\n3.7.3 Documentary Review Check list.", "word_count": 394, "start_char": 59484, "end_char": 62193}

Various publications,\nmagazines, newspapers reports, contract documents, historical documents and other sources of\npublished information where critically reviewed by the researcher. Amin (2005) stated that\nsecondary data is helpful in the research design of subsequent primary research and provides a\nbaseline with which the collected primary data results can be compared to other methods.\n\n3.8.1 Validity.\n\nValidity refers to the extent to which a research instrument accurately measures what it intends to\nmeasure. In other words, a valid instrument should assess the specific concept or construct it is\ndesigned to assess. The validity of the instrument quantitatively was established using the Content\nValidity Index (C.V.I). This involved the researcher scoring of the relevance of the questions in the\ninstrument in relation to the study variables. Basing on Amin (2005), a C.V.I of more than 0.7\nimplies that the tool is valid; this ensured that all items used to measure each variable where\nrelevant in measuring what they where supposed to measure hence the instruments where valid as\nthe coefficient of determination was above 0.7.\n\nTo be more specific, the instruments where discussed with the supervisor to ensure construct and\ncontent validity. The construct validity of the instrument focused on ensuring that the\nrespondents found the questions simple to understand and answer with regards to the study.\nTo establish validity qualitatively, the instruments where given to an expert (supervisor) to\nevaluate the relevance of each item in the instrument to the objectives and rate each item on the\nscale of very relevant (4), quite relevant (3), somewhat relevant (2), and not relevant (1).\n\n3.8.2 Reliability.\n\nQualitatively, reliability of the instruments was established through a pilot test of the\nquestionnaire to ensure consistency and dependability and its ability to extract data that\nanswered the objectives of the study. The results of the findings where subjected to a reliability\nanalysis there after.\n\nQuantitatively, reliability was established using the Cronbach’s Alpha Reliability Coefficient\ntest. Upon performing the test, the values 0.7 and above, showed that the items in the instrument\nwhere reliable. Based on Cronbach’s Alpha Coefficient, the scales for the variables were\nreliable.

Thematic analysis\nwas the most common form of analysis in qualitative research of this study as it emphasized\npinpointing,\nexamining, and recording patterns (or \"themes\") within data. Themes are patterns across data sets\nthat are important to the description of a phenomenon and are associated to a specific research\nquestion. The themes become the categories for analysis. Thematic analysis is performed through\nthe process of coding in six phases to create established, meaningful patterns (Creswell, 2003).\nThese phases are: familiarization with data, generating initial codes, searching for themes among\ncodes, reviewing themes, defining and naming themes, and producing the final report.

The findings to address this objective were obtained using\nquestionnaire surveys and interviews. The self administered questionnaire measured transparency\nand efficiency under E-GP using ten items on a five point Likert scale.

The researcher discovered that the E-GP\nsystem implements access controls which ensure that only authorized individuals for-example\nprocurement officials have access to sensitive supplier information. During the bidding processes,\nsuppliers’ identities and bid details are kept confidential until the evaluation process is completed to\nensure a fair competition.
