The study utilized hydrated lime\nto substitute GSD at 0%, 1%, 2%, 3%, and 4% by weight of aggregates. A series of\nlaboratory tests—Marshall Stability, Marshall Flow, Bulk density, Air voids, Indirect\nTensile Strength (ITS)—were used to evaluate workability properties. Notably, the\n3% hydrated lime demonstrated the best performance, denoted by the maximum\nMarshall Stability of 16.7 kN, best Flow of 3.6 mm, maximum Bulk density of 2.344\ng/cm3, and best moisture resistance with a TSR of 96%. It is evident that the use of\n3% hydrated lime improves the workability of GSD asphalt for low-volume road\nconstructions in tropical environments such as Uganda.\n\nii\n\nDECLARATION\nI, Shadrach Ahumuza Ainebyona, hereby declare that this research proposal report\nwas a result of my own work and has not been submitted for any other degree or\nacademic award.

Because of its high thermal capacity, it\nwas also useful in high temperature conditions as it mitigated rutting (Jwaida et\nal., 2024). While this approach improved pavement performance, the workability\nof the granite stone dust was negatively affected. (Ochen, 2024).\n1.2 Problem Statement\nRoads in the Lweeza community that use GSD-modified asphalt have experienced\nthis premature deterioration, even within the planned design life. Pavement\nfailures such as ravelling, stripping, cracking, and pothole formation negatively\naffected the durability of the road. Despite proper drainage systems in place, a\nlack of rutting (indicating heavy traffic loads), and being that it was situated in a\nresidential area where the access road was not in proximity to any swamps\n(indicating moisture infiltration due to capillary action). While stop-and-go traffic\nwas indeed a source of mechanical wear and tear on the road, it accelerated\npavement failure. The road was a low-traffic volume access road, and was still\nwithin its design life, implying that it should still be withstanding the traffic\nloading that it was designed for, for the duration of its design life. These defects\nare largely attributed to poor compaction and uneven binder coating due to the\nstiff and segregated nature of granite stone dust-modified mixtures. The resulting\nlower densities significantly compromised pavement durability and lifespan. The\nangularity and texture of granite stone dust led to reduced workability, making\nmixing, compaction, and application more difficult.", "word_count": 268, "start_char": 13627, "end_char": 15436}

This\nprocess translated to lower densities, lower pavement life, and higher\nmaintenance costs.\nAlthough the early failure of the pavement could be attributed to the\nworkmanship, the above consideration ignores the material science constraint\nimposed by the mixture, causing the inherent workability issues. The granite stone\ndust caused workability issues due to the high internal friction due to the high\nangularity, the presence of siliceous material that reduced the affinity for the\nbinder, and the rough texture that reduced the aggregate and binder bond. This\nrequired additional compactive force for the creation of a homogenous, pliable,\nand compact asphalt mixture. That can be applied on the road. The use of the\ngranite stone dust created a ceiling on achievable densities and coating quality,\nmaking the best aggregate-binder adhesion and compaction difficult to achieve\neven with good field practice. Consequently, failures like ravelling and stripping\nthat accelerated pavement failures are the inevitable outcome of using a filler\nwhose properties naturally resist effective mixing and compaction. This study\nseeks to address the workability challenges of the GSD-modified asphalt in order to\nretain its benefits as a sustainable construction material with high thermal\ncapacity (preventing rutting) while improving its binder-aggregate adhesion and\ncompact-ability in order to engineer a more workable, durable, water-resistant\npavement for reliable, sustainable construction.\nHydrated lime has been studied extensively and proven to be an effective antistripping agent.

This was the first\nstudy to investigate the lime-granite stone dust synergy in Uganda’s tropical\nclimates, and will provide Uganda’s Ministry of Works with evidence-based\nhydrated lime performance data and dosage guidelines.\nHydrated lime Improves Binder-Aggregate Adhesion by forming strong chemical\nbonds at the binder-aggregate interface, reducing stripping and Moisture\nsusceptibility (Han et al, 2019). Hydrated lime mitigates this by decreasing the\nflexibility of particles, increasing the mix's compatibility. It improves the binder's\ncohesiveness and flow qualities by reducing the stiffening effect caused by angular\nparticles like granite stone dust by lubricating contact points and reducing friction,\nmaking the asphalt mix easier to work with and compact during construction.\n(Little and Epps, 2006) Finally, by neutralizing acids, lime slows the oxidative aging\nof asphalt, extending pavement life and improving durability.", "word_count": 285, "start_char": 18416, "end_char": 20466}

In essence, workability of an asphalt\nmixture denotes the ease of mixing, transport, spreading, and compaction into the\ndesired, compact surface. This factor, which ascertains the proper coating and\ncompaction of the mixture, stands as the backbone for the longevity of the\nasphalt. The jagged nature, as well as the grain size, of the GSD particles limits\nthe workability of the GSD-modified asphalts.\nAdding hydrated lime to GSD-modified asphalt makes it more workable due to the\ninteraction between the lime and the aggregates and the binder, which makes the\nparticles less stiff and lubricates the contact points.

Nonetheless, granite stone\ndust, which has acted as the filler material in Uganda based on the availability and\nperformance characteristics, has shown some negative effects regarding the\nworkability of the asphalt mixture. More recent research work has, therefore,\nfocused on the use of additives, such as lime, as one of the alternatives for\nenhancing the workability and performance. This literature study reviews the\navailable knowledge regarding the use of granite dust as the filler material, as well\nas the degree to which lime has proved effective.\n2.1 Granite Stone Dust in Asphalt\nThe Granite Stone dust is the by-product of the granite industry. The rut\nresistance, the rigidity and the water resistance of the road are better with the\nuse of granite stone despite the nature of the stone dust, that is to say the\nangularity and roughness (De Medeiros et al., 2023; Jwaida et al., 2024; Oesman et\nal., 2021). Regardless of these advantages, the shape of particles and the high\ninternal interlock of the stone dust in the asphalt composite restrict the mixability of the mixture and results in the inherent mixing, compaction and\napplication difficulties. Bessa and others (2015) elaborated that mineral powder\nand powder content shape affect the compaction and thus usually cause the\nsegregation and variations in density when laying the final surface.", "word_count": 283, "start_char": 23742, "end_char": 25565}

Workability can be explained as the ease\nof mixing, transporting, spreading, and compaction of asphalt. For granite dustmodified mixes, the high internal friction and absorption properties of the GSD\nlimit the flexibility of the mixture, making compaction processes more difficult\nand prone to early failure. The higher absorption properties of GSD compared to\nthe smoothed fillers increase internal friction and deterioration, making it difficult\nfor the mixture to be well compacted, leading to low density and high early failure\nrates, such as stripping, ravelling, and the development of potholes (Ochen, 2024).\nGudimettla, Murali, and Tharaghini (2004) explained that the workability problems\ncan result in the development of an imbalanced binder coating, which enhances\nsegregation and the development of the structure’s defect. In addition, the use of\nGSD experiences drawbacks regarding the design performance. Studies show that\nno more than 3% of GSD can be well utilized in the design of some asphalt\nmixtures, compared to 7.5% for cement fillers (Oesmanet al., & Benny, 2021)\n2.3 Hydrated Lime Effect on Asphalt Mixtures\nHydrated lime has shown enhanced performance characteristics for the asphalt\nmixture. This was because it promotes aggregate and binder adhesion as a result of\nthe formation of strong chemical bonds with the components of the bitumen,\nhence calcium soap, which promotes binding and coating (Han et al., 2019).\nMoreover, it acts as a plastic modifier, softening the particles in the mixture and\nmaking it easier to compact, ensuring that the mixture was cohesive (Little &\nEpps, 2006). Hydrated lime also works as an anti-stripping agent, neutralizing the\nacidic components of the bitumen, hence enhancing resistance to stripping (ASTM\nD7173).", "word_count": 325, "start_char": 25369, "end_char": 27511}

According to Han et al. (2019), \"Lime addition can enhance the\npolar component of the surface free energy (SFE) of the asphalt binder and\nimprove the wetting and binding interaction between the asphalt binder and\naggregates.” In regard to reduced compaction efforts, the study by Little and Epps\n(2006) proved that the addition of lime to the asphalt mixture reduces compaction\nefforts by 20%, thus allowing for faster and denser compaction. De Medeiros et al.\n(2023) proved that the use of lime satisfies the complete substitution of the\nconventional fillers, up to 100%, while maintaining the same levels of mechanical\nstrength but certainly increasing workability and environmental sustainability. In\nUganda, the average annual temperature, which varies from 20 – 28°C, intensifies\nthe stiffening effect of the granular material, especially if the material was\nsubjected to dry climatic conditions, thus making the workability process an\nintegral priority for improvement. As a hydrate, lime carries a high lubrication\ncapacity, as it reduces the particles' interaction and thus enhances the process of\ncompaction. According to the research by Denis (2024), “Lubrication reduces\ncompaction resistance and makes compaction easier.” In addition, lime helps to\novercome the challenge of oxidative aging, thus making the material less reactive\nand, therefore, less harmful to the environment. As presented in the study by\nLittle and Epps (2006), \"Lime reduces the potential for oxidative aging and protects\nthe asphalt binder against reactive acidic compounds, which makes the material\nespecially effective for use and durable performance, especially in hot and tropical\nclimates.” Although the lime increases the binding capacity between the binder\nand aggregate, the effect of the lime on the viscosity of the bitumen requires\ncareful consideration.

This factor can enhance the cohesion of the mixture but limit\nworkability if the lime content becomes excessive. This study, therefore, carries\nout an elaborate assessment of the workability of the mixture using various lime\nconcentrations to ascertain the optimal content that presents the most benefits\nwithout undermining the workability.\n2.4 Optimum content of Granite Stone Dust\nIn the experiment, the industrial waste obtained from granite stone production,\nwhich came as dust, was utilized as filling material present in the AC-WC mixture.\nThe amount of filling material used varies from 3%, 4.5%, 6%, 7.5%, 9%, based on\nthe comparison using cement filler. The experiment involved the use of wheel\ntracking equipment designed to operate at 60°C, 45°C, and 30°C.

The use of a 7.5%\ncement filler results in the maximum dynamic stability rating, 2520.0 passing/mm.\nMeanwhile, asphalt concrete with 3% granite filler content attained the maximum\ndynamic stability value, 1465.1 passing/mm, surpassing that of cement filler of the\nsame degree (1400 passing/mm).\nFigure 2: The depth of deformation on the pavement at 600C.\n\nThe graphic indicates that the deformation depth was not proportional to the\nfiller content or kind. The smallest deformation (2.01 mm) in cement-filled\npavement occurs at a filler level of 7.5%. On the granite filler pavement, the\nsmallest distortion (2.42 mm) occurs at 3% filler content.\n\nFigure 3: The deformation velocity of asphalt concrete\n\nThe diagram indicates that the relationship between deformation velocity and\nfiller content was not linear, nor is the type of filler.

The loss in dynamic stability was related to\nthe asphalt's great sensitivity to temperature changes.\n(Tiwari, Satyam &Miani, 2022) investigated the integration of MW as a filler at\n4.5%, 5.5%, 7%, and 8.5% by weight in hot mix asphalt. The altered mixtures met\nthe requirements for abrasion, moisture damage, and Marshall Stability tests.\n(Khan et al, 2023) did a similar investigation on the use of MW as a filler in hot mix\nasphalt, investigating filler amounts ranging from 0 to 6 wt. % of aggregates.

With the limestone aggregates in the\ncombinations, 4% MW was determined to be the optimal level. However, when the\namount of filler (marble powder) in the asphalt mixture grew, the fatigue life\ndecreased.

The commonly used filler, hydrated lime, was replaced with residue in\nproportions of 50% and 100% by weight. The results revealed that, as compared to\nthe reference combination (having 0% residue), the asphalt mixture compromising\nwaste marble and granite performed somewhat better mechanically.

Fineness (Particle Size Distribution): To determine the particle size\ndistribution the use of a dry sieve analysis method according to ASTM C110.\nFiner particles of lime promoted the packing density of the asphalt mix and\nenhanced the interaction of the binder and the aggregates leading to lower\nair voids and improving the workability.\n2. Moisture Content: In order to prevent cracking during storage we determine\nthe moisture content by the means of oven-dry method (ASTM C25), to make\nsure that the moisture content did not exceed 2%.\n3. Bulk Density and Specific Gravity: The density values are crucial for\nvolumetric calculations for the mix design. The standards were required to\nbe 400-600 kg/m3 and 2.2-2.4 respectively.\nChemical Properties\nCalcium Hydroxide Content (Ca (OH)2 Purity: The high purity is necessary for the\nneutralization of the acidic components and enhance better coating at the binder\naggregate interface.

Marshall Mix Design: Asphalt specimens were created in accordance with\nASTM D6926 specifications. Multiple batches were prepared, with 0%, 1%,\n2%, 3%, and 4% hydrated lime substituting some of the GSD by weight. The\noptimum binder content (OBC) was determined for the control mixture using\nstandard Marshall Stability and Flow analysis.\n2. The optimum hydrated lime content was determined for each mixture using\nMarshall Stability and Flow analysis, as well as Bulk Density.\n3. Preliminary Workability tests: To evaluate the ease of mixing, compaction,\nand handling, we performed a Marshall Flow, Stability, and the bulk density\n(Saturated Surface Dry Method),\n4. Selection Criteria: The dosage with the best mix of workability and\nstructural performance (stability, flow, and density) were deemed ideal.\nObjective 3: Assessment of Workability.\nAsphalt is a composite material; therefore, its workability is a composite property\nrather than a single measurable characteristic, like specific gravity. Instead, it’s a\ncombination of a number of components that come together to give the asphalt\ncomposite its workability. That is to say, workability addressed the components of\nthe composites ‘ease of mix-ability, compact-ability, and applicability.

The Marshall Flow Test (ASTM D6927) measured the deformation of asphalt\nunder load. Higher flow numbers typically suggest improved workability.\nThat is the sample’s vertical deformation at the peak load point. It gauged\nthe mix’s flexibility or plastic deformation. This was a direct indicator of\nworkability. A mixture with a higher flow value was less stiff and more\npliable, making it easier to compact and apply within the field without\nleading to segregation. The mix was brittle and stiff (poor workability) if the\nflow was very low. It was too plastic and prone to rutting if the flow was\nextremely high.\n2. The Bulk Density Test (Saturated Surface Dry Method) determined compactability by measuring the density of the compacted material. The density of\na compacted asphalt sample can be determined with great accuracy using\nthis test. Three conditions are used to weigh the sample: dry, immersed in\nwater, and saturated (surface-dry). We computed its volume and density\nusing these weights. Compact-ability was the outcome of workability, and\ndensity was the gold standard for this. Every sample in the lab was\ncompressed with precisely the same amount of energy (75 Marshall Hammer\nblows).

The properties of the binder are\ninstrumental in defining mixture behaviour. The binder was placed in temperaturecontrolled containers that are sealed at about 25 °C, as a precaution to inhibit\naging. It was conditioned before the test, correct testing temperature (e.g.,60 °C)\naccording to ASTM D36 (Standard Test Method for Softening Point).\n2. Aggregates: Granite Stone Dust (GSD) was collected from the local quarries\nwithin Lweeza. It was important that it was representative of the real material\nthat was used in the local pavement layers. The mineral composition and particle\nsize distribution were checked. Standard coarse and finely aggregated materials\nwere sourced with certified suppliers, in line with ASTM C33 (Standard\nSpecification of Concrete Aggregates).

The physical properties,\nelemental composition and morphology of Granite Stone Dust (GSD) had been\nexplored along with the chemical and physical properties of Hydrated Lime (HL) in\nthe test certificate issued by the lab. These results form a good basis in analysing\nthe behaviour of Granite Stone Dust modified asphalt mixes with a partial\nsubstitution of the substitute filler material with hydrated lime during subsequent\nstages of the experiment.\n4.2 Characterisation of Hydrated Lime.\nThe hydrated lime (HL) used as the modifying agent in this study was acquired\nfrom Tororo Cement and was taken through the tests to establish its quality at the\nCentral Materials Laboratory- Kireka.\nIn this section, the secondary data, as in the test certificate (Ref: CML:\n012/26/08/25), was utilised to verify the quality of the material and also to gain\ndeeper insight on the effect of the substance on the workability of the GSD\nmodified asphalt mixtures because of the nature of its physical and chemical\nproperties that have the potential to counter the shortcoming of the GSD nature.\n\nParameter\nAchieved\nRequired (BS-EN 459-1:\nCalcium\n&\nMagnesium\nOxides (%)\nAvailability\nLime\nas\nCa(OH)2\nTotal CaO content (%)\n60.0\n-\nTotal MgO content (%)\n3.1\nFree Water Content\n0.5\nDensity (kgm-3)\n-\nVolume (m3)\n3.43 x 10-4\n-\nSpecific Gravity\n2.45\n-\nTable 2; Source: Secondary data from CML KirekaLab Test on Tororo Road lime\n\n4.2.1 The physical and chemical properties of Hydrated lime\nThe test findings demonstrated that the procured hydrated lime was of good\nquality and met the required international construction lime standard, BS EN 459-\n1: 2015.

The amount of moisture in lime when its\ntoo high will cause foaming and release steam till it interacts with\nhot binder lime at (150-160°C) Moisture Water Content of 0.5% was\nextremely low which was a most desirable property. This adversely\nimpacts the integrity of the mixture that might leave voids and\nweaken the structure of the mixture (Han et al., 2019). This lime had\na low Moisture content which facilitated enhanced binder aggregate\ncoating and compaction.\n Specific Gravity: The specific Gravity is necessary for volumetric\ncalculations to facilitate carrying out of the Marshall mix design. This\ntest identified the density of the hydrated lime in comparison with\nwater. Specific Gravity of 2.45 calculated was found to be within\nnormal range of hydrated lime (2.2 -2.4) as stated in literature and in\nthe project proposal. The objective was to ensure the best balance\nof density and air voids is achieved.\nThe hydrated lime proved to possess adequate chemical and physical properties\nto facilitate the experimentation to understand the effect on the workability of\nthe synergy between the GSD and hydrated lime mixture.\n\n4.2.2 Particle Size Distribution\n\nTable 3; Source: Secondary Data from Lab analysis on Hydrated Lime\nThe particle size distribution of hydrated lime as determined by dry sieve analysis\nin accordance with BS EN 459-2:2021.\n\nFigure 8: Fineness of Hydrated Lime", "word_count": 272, "start_char": 49995, "end_char": 51687}
{"chunk_id": "DOC0007__00024", "doc_id": "DOC0007", "chunk_index": 24, "text": "igure 8: Fineness of Hydrated Lime\n\nThis test is very important, as it gave a measure of the fineness of the lime, which\nis a determining factor in its efficiency when mixed with the asphalt. The test\nrevealed that the hydrated lime is very fine, having 100% of it pass through the\n5.00 mm sieve and 20% of it pass through the 0.075 mm sieve, which is the No. 200\nsieve. Its high fineness is important in the project due to the following reasons:\n Improved Reactivity and Filler Effectiveness: The higher surface area of the\nfiner particles led to more points of contact between the particles and the\nasphalt binder to which chemical reactions could be enhanced. This led to\nmore beneficial calcium soap formation at the asphalt binder and aggregate\ninterface, which is basically how finer hydrated lime increased adhesion and\nreduced Moisture Susceptibility (Little and Epps, 2006). A finer lime is,\ntherefore, a more reactive lime.\n Improved Workability and Lubrication. The small, spherical, smooth\nparticles of hydrated lime worked as a physical lubricant when mixed with\nthe angular and rough texture of the Granite Stone Dust (GSD). These\nparticles filled up the spaces between the large, angular particles of GSD\nand aggregate. As a result, the friction between the particles decreased.\nConsequently, the interlocking of particles, which made the mix of GSD stiff\nand difficult to compact, and the workability issue plaguing this study were\nsignificantly reduced.\nTherefore it can be concluded that the PSD proved that the hydrated lime\npossessed the necessary physical properties (fineness) to perform effectively either\n\nas a chemical modifier and adhesion enhancer, and/or a physical lubricant to take\nadvantage of the workability provided by the stiff GSD-modified asphalt.\n4.3 Granite stone dust: physical and chemical profile\nIn this study, we closely examined the granite stone dust (GSD), which is the\nprimary filler to be used by utilised for experimentation. It is essential to\nunderstand the physical and chemical properties. To establish the composition of\nthe granite stone dust, we conducted X-ray Fluorescence (XRF), and to evaluate\nthe shape and surfaces, we conducted a scanning electron microscope (SEM) test,\nwhich provided important information to explain the workability problems\nassociated with GSD-modified asphalt.\n4.3.1.

These sharp\n\nedges are the reasons why mixes with the GSD were more frictional and\nstiffer (Oesman et al. 2021), which directly relates to workability.\n Aluminosilicate framework: The presence of high amounts of Aluminium\nOxide (Al2O3), Potassium Oxide (K2O), and Na2O suggests the presence of\nfeldspar minerals common in granitic rocks. The aluminosilicate component\nis another factor adding to the inert and stable composition of the mixture\nwithin the asphalt. Unlike cement and hydrated lime, which react and can\nwork to improve cohesiveness, GSD does not take part in any pozzolanic\nreaction.\n Loss on Ignition (LOI):The low value of LOI, which is 0.38%, shows little\npresence of moisture, carbonates, and organics. It is an advantageous filler\nproperty because it translates to low volatility when mixed hot, which could\nresult in voids and compromise the asphalt integrity.\n Calcium Oxide (CaO): CaO is merely 1.86%, which is substantially less than\nthe CaO present in hydrated lime (60% total CaO content). This reflects a\ntotal inability on the part of GSD to show any chemical reactivity, which\ncould otherwise act as a binding agent between the aggregate and binder.\n4.3.2 Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)\nSEM analysis gave information on the texture and shape of the particles of GSD.\nRefer to Figure 4.1, which is the SEM photograph, to supplement the information\non the chemical workability.", "word_count": 304, "start_char": 54008, "end_char": 55913}

These are due to the\nfracturing of granite, which is a hard rock.\n Surface Texture: The particles are observed to have a rough, irregular\nstructure under the microscope, which further increases the friction\nbetween the particles, thereby increasing the strength of the mixture.\nTaking into consideration the above points, it could be said that the observations\nshow that the GSD used was locally extracted siliceous filler, which is chemically\ninert and has very angular and rough particles.\n4.3.2 Link to the workability\nThe primary particle regime-related factor behind the decreased workability\nassociated with asphalt mixtures modified by the addition of GSD is the presence\nof angular and rough particles. During the mixture and compaction phases, such\nparticles are reluctant to slide against each other and the aggregate, which is\nmore difficult and also tends to generate inconsistencies associated with\nseparation (Gudimettla et al., 2004). This is associated with decreased density and\n\nincreased susceptibility to elevated pavement defects such as ravelling and\ncracking.\n4.4 Marshall Properties of Asphalt Mixture with varying Lime content\nThe main objective of the experimental part of this research compromised\nbatching and evaluating asphalt mixtures with varied percentages of Hydrated\nLime (0%,1%,2%,3%,4%) partially replacing part of the Granite Stone Dust (GSD)\nfiller. The table below compiles the Marshall Mix design results for every blend.\nTable 5: Summary of Marshall Properties\n\n4.4.1 Analysis of Marshall Properties\n1. Marshall Flow: The sample's vertical deformation at the peak load point. It\ngauged the mix's flexibility or plastic deformation. This was a direct\nindicator of workability. A mixture with a higher flow value was less stiff\nand more pliable, making it easier to compact and apply with in the field\nwithout leading to segregation. The mix was brittle and stiff (poor\nworkability) if the flow was very low. It was too plastic and prone to rutting\nif the flow was extremely high. The ease of particle rearrangement under\nstress can be directly measured in a lab setting using the Marshall Flow\nvalue.

It was evident from our raising\nflow values with lime concentration that we are lowering internal friction\nand improving the mixture's workability.\nIn order to demonstrate that we had produced a workable but stable mix,\nwe determined the lime concentration that provided us with a flow value\nwithin the ideal specification range (2-4mm). While a very high flow value\ncan indicate a mix that was too plastic and prone to rutting, our optimal\nflow value of 3.6 mm for the 3% lime mix was a direct indicator of superior\ncompact-ability. This was not about making construction easier for workers;\nit's about building a more durable road.\nA workable mix ensures we can achieve the target density in the field.\nThere are fewer and smaller interconnecting air voids in a mix that has\nbetter compact-ability. This was because the internal resistance caused by\nthe interlocking of the GSD, was mitigated by the HL, making the mixture\neasier to mix and compact, therefore achieving a higher density. As a result,\nwater was kept out by a homogeneous layer that was almost impermeable.\nThis directly stopped the ravelling, stripping, and potholes we observed on\nthe Lweeza road because water seeps into the already weakly bonded\naggregates and binder, the main source of the stripping damage. This\nimprovement was demonstrated by our ITS test, which showed that the 3%\nlime mix maintained its strength even when wet with a 96% TSR.

We are\ndirectly ensuring the development of a more uniform, denser, impermeable\npavement structure that was intrinsically more resilient.\n2. Marshall Stability: The Peak load that the sample can bear before failing. It\ngauged the mixture's shear strength to ensure we weren't creating a weak,\nmushy mix by increasing workability. We demonstrated that the limemodified mixture was genuinely more robust and resilient to shoving and\nrutting under vehicles. When HL was added, Marshall Stability rose by up to\n3%. With a peak stability of 16.7 kN, the 3% HL mix significantly\noutperformed the control mix by (13.3 kN). But at 4% HL, the stability fell to\n12.8 kN, which was less than the performance of the control mix. Lime\nmodification significantly increased stability, with the 3% lime mix showing\nthe peak strength (16.7 kN)\nIt's a frequent misconception that a more workable blend has to be weaker.\nOur findings clearly disprove this trade-off. Not only did the 3% lime mixture\nbecome easier to deal with, but it also became stronger and more cohesive\nby nature. In addition to being brittle, weaker, and unworkable, the control\nmix (0% lime) had the lowest stability. Internal friction and particle\ninterlock created a weak, brittle form of strength that causes cracking, at\nthe points of its stiffness.\nWe replaced the brittle, frictional strength with cohesive, ductile strength\nby adding hydrated lime. Two things were done by the lime; it improved\nworkability and decreased the detrimental internal friction by physically\n\nlubricating the angular GSD particles. It strengthened the binder-aggregate\nlink chemically.\nThe end product was a mixture that was easier to compact and stronger\nunder load. Not only was the 3% lime combination easier to use, but it also\nperforms better overall. It possessed the structural strength to withstand\nrutting and deformation under traffic for many years to come, as well as the\nworkability to be compacted into a dense, impermeable layer in the field.\nFigure 10: Graph of Marshall Flow and Stability", "word_count": 383, "start_char": 59861, "end_char": 62235}

Density: This test can be used to measure density of compacted asphalt\nsample with a lot of accuracy. The sample is weighed in three conditions,\nnamely, dry, in water, and saturated (surface-dry). With these weights we\ndetermined its volume and density. Determination of density is the gold\nstandard for testing compact-ability. All samples in the laboratory are\nsubjected to the same pressure (75 Marshall Hammer blows). Since mixes\nbecome more readily workable as their density increases, a higher density\n\nachieved in one mix compared to another at the same compaction effort\nresulted in a more workable mix. The observation that our 3% lime mixture\nachieved the greatest specific gravity was sufficient testimony that it was\nthe easiest to ram. The lime mix achieved a density of 2.344 kg/m3, the\nmaximum compact-ability.\nDensity and durability are synonymous in asphalt construction. Increasing\nthe workability does not only make the work of construction workers easier,\nbut it also helped directly in achieving a construction material which was\nmore resistant to failure.\n4. Voids: The density achieved in the previous test and the theoretical\nmaximum density of the mix facilitated the calculation of the percentage of\nsmall air gaps that were enclosed between the components. The air voids\nare vital to performance. Should it have been excessively low, this would\nhave caused the asphalt to bleeding. The pavement will however become\ntoo permeable when the air voids are excessive. Moisture damage\n(stripping) can be induced by air and water intrusion through the voids and\ncause rapid binder aging. The huge air pores in the 0 % lime (control)\nmixture was a sign that it was hard to compress and was not easily\nworkable. The 3 % lime mix achieved the optimal air voids about 4 %, which\nmeant that we had the denser, optimised, and more workable mixture.\nThe aim of this was a layer with semi-impermeability and possessing\noptimum voids. It is not so porous that the binder will ooze to the surface in\nhot climates, and it should also not be too impermeable so as to exclude\nmost of the water and air, which will cause stripping and ageing.
