Section 33(3)4 stipulates that where a Warranty is not complied\nwith, the insurer is discharged from liability as from the date of the breach of the Warranty and\nwithout prejudice to any liability incurred by the insurer before the date.\nThus, this research analyses the principle of utmost good faith and Warranties; the applicability\nin Uganda, compares the provisions in Uganda with other jurisdictions, identifies the areas for\nenhancement, and proposes actionable statutory reforms that promote fairness and\ntransparency in insurance transactions.\nChapter 1 will seek to examine the duty of utmost good faith and Warranties, Chapter 2 will\ncover Uganda’s application of the principle of utmost good faith, Warranties, and examination\nof how the principles have been applied, Chapter 3 will cover the application of utmost good\nfaith and Warranties in other jurisdictions, Chapter 4 will cover proposals for reforms, a\nsummary of findings, Recommendations, and conclusion.\nBackground of the study\nThe Insurance contracts are largely based on the principle of utmost good faith that must be\nobserved by both the insured and the insurer5. Good faith means a state of mind consisting of\nhonesty in belief or purpose, faithfulness to one’s duty or obligation, and observance of\nreasonable commercial standards of fair dealing in a given trade or business6.

Section 178 provides that a contract of marine\ninsurance is based upon the utmost good faith and if this duty is not observed by either party,\nthe contract may be avoided by the other party. Thus, the principle of utmost good faith reflects\nthe openness and fair dealing required of the parties in the various stages of their relationship9.\nHistorically, the leading case on utmost good faith in insurance is Carter v Boehm10, Lord\nMansfield stated that; “Insurance is a contract upon speculation. The special facts, upon which\nthe contingent chance is to be computed, lie most commonly in the knowledge of the insured\nonly: the under-writer trusts to his representation, and proceeds upon the confidence that he\ndoes not keep back any circumstance in his knowledge, to mislead the underwriter into a belief\nthat the circumstance does not exist, and to induce him to estimate the risk as if it did not exist”\nand further held that the rationale for adopting the duty of utmost good faith is that when the\ninsured conceals material facts, the insurer agrees to insure on the false estimate of the risk.\nThus, in the 19th Century, the cases referred to the duty of utmost good faith to express the precontractual duty of disclosure and the duty not to misrepresent material facts as per Brownlie\nV Campbell11.\nInitially the law that provided for the principle of utmost good faith in the UK was the Marine\nInsurance Act 1906. Section 1712 provided that a contract of insurance is based upon the\nprinciple of utmost good faith, and, if the principle of utmost good faith is not observed, the\ncontract may be avoided by the other party. The agent’s duty of disclosure provided under\nSection 1913, the duty of the insured not to make any misrepresentations and if he or she does,\nthe insurer may avoid the contract as referred to under Section 2014, the duty on the insured to\ndisclose all material facts as referred to under Section 1815.\nIt must be noted that all the above provisions on Utmost good faith are also reflected in the\nMarine Insurance Act 2002 Laws of Uganda. Section 1716 provides that a contract of marine\ninsurance is based upon the utmost good faith and if not observed, the contract may be avoided", "word_count": 430, "start_char": 13934, "end_char": 16397}

Section 1917 stipulates that where a contract is effected for the insured by an\nagent or broker, then the agent or broker must disclose every material fact that is known to\nhimself or herself and is deemed to know every circumstance which in the ordinary course of\nbusiness ought to be known by, or to have been communicated to him or her and every material\ncircumstances which the insured is bound to disclose unless it comes to his or her knowledge\ntoo late to communicate it to the agent or broker.\nSection 1818 provides that the assured must disclose to the insurer every material circumstance\nwhich is known to the assured and if the insured fails to make that disclosure before the contract\nis concluded, the insurer may avoid the contract. And Section 2019 provides for the duty of the\ninsured not to make any misrepresentations and that if they do, the insurer may avoid the\ncontract.\nThe above different sections have been applied by courts for example in Hajji Kavuma Haroon\nV First Insurance Company Ltd20 court noted that the non-disclosure and misrepresentation\nalleged and proved by the defendant went to the root of the contract and thus the insured was\nin breach of the principle of utmost good faith thus the insurer was entitled to avoid the contract\ndue to the dishonesty of the plaintiff.\nIn Uganda, there have been incidents where the duty of utmost good faith has been considered\nto be unfair regarding its applicability in the insurance industry in Uganda, and as a result, there\nhave been proposals for reform in this area of insurance law. For example Justice Stephen\nMusota National Insurance Corporation V Sylvan Kakugu21 stated that the duty is unfair\nbecause; the insured can be unaware of their duty to disclose information, the only remedy for\nbreach of utmost good faith is avoiding the entire contract, and the insurer is not required to\nshow that the none disclosure or misrepresentation had any causal link to the claim to avoid\nthe contract and also the insured is required to provide material information that would\ninfluence the judgment of a prudent insurer, this favours insurers to escape liability for a loss\nby reference to the standard of underwriting diligence and prudence of the prudent insurer even\nthough the non-disclosed facts might not affect their willingness to write the risk22.", "word_count": 399, "start_char": 16784, "end_char": 19137}

However, Uganda\nhas not had any amendment in the Marine Insurance Act 2002 on the principle of utmost good\nfaith.\nOn the other hand, Section 33(1)25 provides that a Warranty means a promissory Warranty\nnamely a Warranty by which the insured undertakes that some particular thing shall or shall not\nbe done, or that some condition shall be fulfilled, or by which he or she affirms or negatives\nthe existence of a particular state of facts. Section 33(3)26 provides that a Warranty is a\ncondition that must be complied with, whether it is material to the risk or not, and if it is not\ncomplied with, then subject to any express provision in the policy, the insurer is discharged\nfrom liability as from the date of the breach of the Warranty and without prejudice to any\nliability incurred y the insurer before the date.\nAlso, the UK Marine Insurance Act 1906, Section 33(3) of the Marine Insurance Act 1906\nprovided that upon breach of a Warranty, the insurer was discharged from all liability as from\nthe date of the breach.

However, Justice Stephen\nMusota28 noted that the duty as provided for in our laws is unfair because; the insured can be\nunaware of their duty to disclose information, the only remedy for breach of utmost good faith\nis avoiding the entire contract, and the insurer is not required to show that the none disclosure\nor misrepresentation had any causal link to the claim to avoid the contract and also the insured\nis required to provide material information that would influence the judgement of a prudent\ninsurer, which is unfair for an ordinary insured.\nIt was also noted that one of the reasons why some people were not insured is because some of\nthe insurance companies do not pay insurance claims as they are presented, and also the breach\nof the duty of utmost good faith leads to the avoidance of the contract by the insurer.29 it was\nalso observed that some of the insurers change service providers without informing their clients\nin regards to their medical insurance and this is also a problem for the insurance industry since\nthis will discourage other people from opting for insurance that will cover their expenses in\ncase of any uncertain risk.30, thus, there are unfair aspects of the duty of utmost good faith in\nthe Ugandan Insurance laws and also challenges faced in promoting this principle both to the\ninsured and insurer in insurance contracts, if these challenges are not addressed with immediate\neffect for instance loopholes in the existing law, ignorance of the law then it may lead to some\npeople not taking insurance.\nSection 33(3) of the UK Marine Insurance Act 1906 provided that upon breach of a Warranty,\nthe insurer was discharged from all liability as from the date of the breach.

The study\nmade jurisdictional comparisons and thus made recommendations necessary for statutory\nreforms to streamline the Insurance industry in Uganda.\nThe study focussed on Kampala and Metropolitan Areas since most insurance companies and\nthe IRA are situated in Kampala.\nLITERATURE REVIEW\nA circumstance is material if it would influence the judgment of a prudent insurer in fixing the\npremium, or determining whether he or she would take the risk.32 This is a difficult situation\nfor the insured as Malcolm Clarkes33 stated that the duty of utmost good faith is tested based\non the judgment of a ‘prudent insurer’ thus the proposer is required to think in a way an insurer\nin the market does, which is unfair to the insured34 Furthermore, in National Insurance\nCorporation V Sylvan Kakugu court noted that the test of materiality assesses the insured by\nreference to the professional knowledge of the insurer which is unfair, and thus proposed the\nneed for the amendment of the Insurance Law in regards to the principle of utmost good faith\nin Uganda.\nFurther, on the point that every piece of information will be considered material if it would\ninfluence the judgment of the prudent insurer at the time of contract or renewal. Hasson R35\nproposed that an insurer’s failure to ask questions at the time of taking out the policy about\nlosses ought to be regarded as a waiver of this information, as should the insurer’s acceptance\nof blank replies to questions in the proposal form regardless of the form of the question and on\nthe other side Merkin R36 proposed that the test that ought to be used is that of a reasonable\ninsured, thus in this research, we will look at which position should Uganda adopt.\n\n32 Section 18(2) of the Marine Insurance Act 2002, Laws of Uganda\n33 Clarke, Malcolm.

In Uganda, one of the unfair aspects of the principle of Utmost\ngood faith is that the insured can still be in breach even if the error was reasonable in\ncircumstances for example if a question was unclear or required specific technical knowledge\nthat they did not have.38 Thus, a need for an amendment of the insurance laws in Uganda which\nis the main purpose of this research.\nThe Insurance Institute of Uganda39 stated that the insured knows or ought to know all about\nthe risk being proposed for insurance as the insurer relies largely on information disclosed by\nthe insured/assured thus most of the facts relating to health, habits, personal history, family\nhistory, etc., which form the basis of the Life Insurance contract, are known only to the insured.\nHowever, Hasson, R40 stated that the doctrine of Utmost good faith assumes that the insured is\nin a stronger position than the insurer because the insured has more knowledge than the insurer,\nhowever submitted that this puts the insured at a disadvantage since the insured does not know\nwhich parts of that information the insurer wishes to have. Thus proposes some reforms that\nstatute should state in the clearest possible language that any failure by an insurer to ask of an\ninsured information customarily sought by insurers in the type of policy in question should be\ndeemed a waiver of such information. Thus, this research will critically assess the principle of\ngood faith and the applicability of the reforms proposed.\nThe Law Commission41 stated that some of the reforms that should be adopted are that the\ninsured should not be under an obligation to disclose some information for example classified\ninformation could include an applicant’s race or nationality; further, the insured should be\ndeemed to be under no obligation to reveal that he has previously been refused thus proposed\nthat about the disclosure of the insured should be penalized only if he acted in bad faith that is\nif he knew, or had very good cause to believe that a particular piece of information would be\nmaterial to the insurer and that the burden of showing bad faith should again be placed on the\ninsurer.", "word_count": 442, "start_char": 28702, "end_char": 31327}

Further, the Law Commission43 pointed out that many laymen\nare not aware that a duty of disclosure exists and that it may be very difficult for those who are\naware of the duty to know what information would be regarded as material by a prudent insurer\nand since specific questions are not asked in proposal forms, it is hard for the insurer to tell and\nmay also have the effect of creating a trap for the insured under the present law since some of\nthem do not know about the disclosure and what is to be disclosed thus proposed that this is\nmischief which requires reform for the protection of the insured and that no general questions\nin addition to specific questions should be permitted, such as a question whether there were\nany other facts which might influence the judgment of a prudent insurer in accepting the risk\nand fixing the premium ought to be avoided.\nThe other unfair aspect of the duty of utmost good faith in insurance law is that the only remedy\nfor breach of good faith duties is retrospective avoidance of the entire contract.44.

In Carter v Boehm52 the court held that the rationale for adopting the duty of\nutmost good faith is that when the insured conceals material facts, the insurer agrees to insure\non the false estimate of the risk.\nThe law that governs the duty of utmost good faith in Uganda is the Marine Insurance Act\n2002.The Court in National Insurance Corporation V Sylvan Kakugu53 noted that the duty of\ngood faith provided for in the Marine Insurance Act 2002 under Sections 17,18,19 and 20\napplies to all sectors of insurance and not just marine insurance. In Uganda, the law governing\nWarranties in insurance is part VIII of the Marine Insurance Act 2002.\nUtmost good faith in the insurance industry\nSection 1754 provides that a contract of marine insurance is based upon the utmost good faith,\nand if the utmost good faith is not observed by either party, the contract may be avoided.

Section 33 of the UK Marine Insurance Act 1906 provided that upon breach of a\nWarranty, the insurer was discharged from all liability as from the date of the breach. This is\nsimilar to Uganda’s current position under Section 33(3)98 which provides that where a\nWarranty is not complied with, whether it is material to the risk or not, the insurer is discharged\nfrom liability as from the date of the breach of the Warranty and without prejudice to any\nliability incurred y the insurer before the date.\nOne of the Respondents at IRA noted that for example where a policy requires one to have a\nfire sprinkler system as a continuing warranty, and there is a loss as a result of a fire, if the\ninsured did not have the fire sprinkler system in place, then the insurance company will not be\nheld liable. In other words, the insurer is discharged from liability. Another example is the\nrequirement of an active alarm system for a specified property (as a Warranty in the policy), if\nany theft occurs and there is no alarm system or a defective alarm system, then the insurance\ncompany will not be held liable\nHowever, there was an amendment to the law relating to Warranties in the UK thus, Section\n10(1) UK Insurance Act 2015 abolishes the rule of automatic discharge and most countries\nhave changed their laws on Warranties including other countries as will be discussed in this\nchapter.\n\n98 Marine Insurance Act 2002", "word_count": 369, "start_char": 52014, "end_char": 54136}

Breach of the principle of utmost good faith entitles any of the\nparties to the insurance contract to avoid the contract as per Section 17 of the Marine Insurance\nAct 2002\nThe agent at Sanlam Insurance Company and the Respondents at the Insurance Regulatory\nAuthority noted that the law (theory) on the principle of utmost good faith stipulated under the\nMarine Insurance Act 2002 is not different from what is in practice, thus once there is a breach\nof the principle of utmost good faith, any of the parties to the insurance contract may avoid the\ncontract.\nThe provisions of the principle of utmost good faith in the Marine Insurance Act 2002 are a\nreplica of the Marine Insurance Act 1906 of the United Kingdom. However, the UK has since\nchanged its provisions on the principle of utmost good faith with the enactment of the UK\nInsurance Act 2015 which introduces the duty of fair presentation which means the duty to\ndisclose in a manner that is reasonably clear and accessible to a prudent insurer as per Section\n3(1) of the UK Insurance Act 2015.\nSection 7(4) of the UK Insurance Act 2015 provides for examples of material circumstances to\nbe disclosed by the insured regarding the principle of utmost good faith like; unusual facts that\nrelate to the risk", "word_count": 355, "start_char": 78428, "end_char": 80536}

Where the Warranties are not\ncomplied with, the insurer is automatically discharged from liability as of the date of the breach.\nThe general rule is that Warranties require strict compliance and it does not matter whether the\nbreach is connected to the risk or loss suffered. However, practice in the Ugandan Insurance\nindustry is that where the breach is not connected to the loss/risk suffered, the insurer and the\ninsured come to a round table and negotiate, but this is at the option of the insurer as noted by\nthe Insurance agent at Sanlam Insurance Company.\nThe provisions in the Marine Insurance Act 2002 are a replica of the Marine Insurance Act\n1906, however, the UK has since changed its provisions in the UK Insurance Act 2015 which\nabolishes the automatic discharge of the insurer’s liability and also provides that where the", "word_count": 469, "start_char": 80328, "end_char": 83085}

Hasson, R123\nnoted that the doctrine of utmost good faith assumes that the insured is in a stronger position\nand thus requires the insured to disclose all the information, however, noted that this is unfair\nespecially where the insurer asks general questions. The Law Commission124 also noted that\nthere is a need for reform to cure the unfairness thus proposing that general questions after\nspecific questions have been asked ought to be avoided.\nSection 18 of the Marine Insurance Act 2002 does not provide for a duty on the insurer to\ninform the insured about the duty of utmost good faith, thus this research proposes the need for\nreform of Section 18 of the Marine Insurance Act 2002 to provide for a duty on the insurer to\ninform the insured about the principle of utmost good faith.\nThe insurer is not required to show that the nondisclosure or misrepresentation had any\ncausal link to the claim.

Justice Stephen Musota in National\nInsurance Corporation V Sylvan Kakugu126noted that this is one of the unfair aspects of the\nprinciple of utmost good faith in Uganda, thus advocating for reforms.

It must be noted that some of the writers for example Hasson, R131\nnoted that the insurer should not be allowed to advantage of the ambiguous situations in the\nproposal form thus proposing the need for reforms.\nThe Marine Insurance Act 2002 is silent on who is held liable if the breach is reasonable in the\ncircumstances, however as noted by Justice Stephen Musota in National Insurance Corporation\nV Sylvan Kakugu132, the practice is that the insured is held liable if the breach was reasonable\nin the circumstances which is unfair in the circumstances thus advocating the need for reform\nThe Law relating to Warranties\nOn the other hand, Section 33(3) of the Marine Insurance Act 2002 states that;\n“A Warranty must be strictly complied with whether it is material or not and if it is not\ncomplied with, the insurer is discharged from liability as from the date of the breach of the\nWarranty, without prejudice to any liability incurred by the insurer before the breach133.”\nWarranties require strict compliance as per this provision. One of the Respondents at Sanlam\nInsurance Company noted that one of the most crucial Warranty is the continuing Warranty\nwhich requires the policyholder to refrain or do something and the insurance companies\nconsider whether one has been obliging with the Warranty also noted however that in practice,\nthe breach ought to be connected to the breach, thus where the breach is not connected to the\nloss, the insurer and the insured come to a round table and negotiate but this is still at the option\nof the insurer.\nSection 34(2) of the Marine Insurance Act 2002 states that;\n\n130 National Insurance Corporation V Sylvan Kakugu Civil Appeal No. 040 of 2015\n131 Hasson, R, ‘The doctrine of uberrima fides in insurance law – a critical evaluation’ (1969) 32 MLR 615\n132 National Insurance Corporation V Sylvan Kakugu Civil Appeal No. 040 of 2015\n133 Marine Insurance Act 2002", "word_count": 409, "start_char": 90556, "end_char": 92964}

This is similar to the amendment provided\nfor by the Insurance Contracts Amendment Act 2013 of (Australia) where the rationale is to\nensure that the insured is informed about what is to be disclosed and also the fact that Insurance\ncontracts are governed by the principle of utmost good faith.\n\n134 Marine Insurance Act 2002", "word_count": 441, "start_char": 92608, "end_char": 95204}

Thus, a need for proposals for reform of the law relating to Warranties so\nthat the insured is not automatically discharged from liability.\nFurthermore, the current Marine Insurance Act 2002 under Section 34(2) provides that the\ninsured cannot rely on the defence that the breach of the Warranty was remedied before the\nloss/ risk. This means that where there is a breach of a Warranty, it does not matter where the\nbreach has been remedied before the loss/ risk, the insurer is still discharged from liability. As\nnoted by the Law Commission before the enactment of the UK Insurance Act 2015, such a\nprovision is also unfair to the insured since some of the Warranty(breach) can be remedied,\nthus the insurer being discharged from liability is unfair to the insured.
