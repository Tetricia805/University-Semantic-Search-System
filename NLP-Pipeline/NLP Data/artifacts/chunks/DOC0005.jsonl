INTRODUCTION\n1.1 BACKGROUND\nAccording to Rosenzweig (2007), the ongoing force of globalization is profoundly reshaping\nthe landscape of business. In response, international companies are increasingly embarking\non ventures into new markets, with a particular focus on developing countries. These\nburgeoning markets hold considerable promise for growth, presenting a unique opportunity to\nexpand the customer base for the products and services these businesses offer.

(2019) and\nCuervo-Cazurra (2017). The primary objective of these studies is to dissect the factors\ncontributing to the challenges that international companies face when attempting to establish\na foothold in developing markets. These challenges encompass a range of complexities, from\nregulatory hurdles to cultural disparities. Researchers have identified a nexus of social,\neconomic, and sociocultural influences that collectively serve as determinants for\ninternational companies seeking to navigate these new markets (Ghatak, 2019; Scullion et al.,\n2018).\nIntriguingly, research conducted by McKinsey and Company underscores the potential\nbenefits of venturing into novel and developing markets. Their findings reveal that companies\ndaring to explore new horizons experience a notable increase of 2% to 5% in revenue growth\ncompared to their counterparts fixated solely on domestic markets (Tiwari et al., 2016). The\nresearch conducted by Ernst and Young (2014) delves even further, substantiating the concept\nthat entry into new markets can act as a catalyst for robust growth. Notably, an Ernst and\nYoung report disclosed that a striking 92% of surveyed companies witnessed tangible growth\nupon venturing into developing countries. Astonishingly, 50% of these companies reported\nrevenue expansion exceeding 10%, further validating the allure of these markets\n(Rosenzweig, 2007).\n\n1.2 problem statement\nInternational corporations seeking expansion into new markets encounter a myriad of\nformidable challenges that impede their seamless market entry and subsequent growth\n(Knight, 2015; Zhang, 2008). These challenges encompass a range of intricate facets,\nincluding unfamiliar cultural norms, diverse regulatory frameworks, fierce competition from\nlocal incumbents, and the imperative to tailor products or services to cater to specific market\ndemands (Zhang, 2008).\nMoreover, the intricate process of navigating complex distribution channels, establishing and\nbolstering brand awareness, cultivating trust among the local populace, and forging\n\nmeaningful relationships with indigenous stakeholders presents formidable hurdles. It is\nworth noting that these hurdles not only elevate operational intricacies and costs but also\nintroduce the looming specter of potential reputational damage and financial losses\n(Felzensztein et al., 2015).\nThe central objective of this proposed study is to clearly identify and comprehensively\nanalyze the paramount challenges that international enterprises face as they embark on their\nentry journey into the developing countries.", "word_count": 440, "start_char": 10447, "end_char": 13598}

The primary objective is to\nanalyze the distinct obstacles that these companies encounter and to investigate how their\nstrategies for market entry and establishment are influenced by various factors within the\nUgandan context. The geographical scope of this investigation will be confined to\ninternational companies operating exclusively within the borders of Uganda (Johnson, 2022).\nThrough an in-depth exploration of the challenges faced by international companies in\nUganda, this research aims to shed light on the intricacies of conducting business in\ndeveloping economies. The analysis will encompass factors such as regulatory environments,\ncultural disparities, limitations in infrastructure, and the competitive landscape.

Inclusive synonyms for international companies include\nmultinational corporations (MNCs) and international corporations. It is important to note that\na company or overseas ventures do not attain the status of international companies unless\nthey make substantial investments in foreign nations, actively manage these operations, and\nconsider them integral components of their strategic and organizational framework (Ghoshal,\n1998). Typically, the headquarters (HQ) or corporate office of a multinational enterprise\n(MNE) is located in its home country, while subsidiaries are situated in foreign host countries.\n2.2 Theoretical review\nUnderstanding the challenges encountered by international companies when entering\ndeveloping countries like Uganda requires the exploration of various theoretical perspectives.\nPrior research has drawn from theories such as Institutional Theory, Market Entry Theory,\nand Resource Dependence Theory. This theoretical review employs a focus on Market Entry\nTheory to elucidate how distinct characteristics of international companies, such as their\nstrategic approach, adaptability, and local engagement, are interconnected with their ability to\nnavigate the complexities of entering developing markets. Market Entry Theory encompasses\nmultifaceted considerations involved in international business expansion. It provides insights\ninto the decision-making processes that companies undergo while seeking entry into foreign\nmarkets. International companies often face challenges in the form of regulatory constraints,\ncultural disparities, and infrastructural limitations when entering developing countries.\nMarket Entry Theory encompasses various strategic approaches, ranging from joint ventures\nand franchising to direct investment, and each approach holds its unique set of challenges and\nopportunities (Hill, 2005).\nAccording to this perspective, international companies must evaluate the optimal mode of\nentry that aligns with their capabilities and the host country's conditions. Dunning's Eclectic\nParadigm, also known as the OLI framework, is particularly relevant here. OLI, comprising\nOwnership, Location, and Internalization advantages, provides a lens to assess whether the\nadvantages held by a company can be better exploited by entering a particular market\n(Dunning, 1980). Ownership advantages refer to the unique assets and capabilities that a\ncompany possesses, Location advantages pertain to the attractiveness of the host market, and\nInternalization advantages assess whether certain activities should be conducted within the\ncompany rather than outsourced.", "word_count": 399, "start_char": 16984, "end_char": 20021}
{"chunk_id": "DOC0005__00007", "doc_id": "DOC0005", "chunk_index": 7, "text": "wnership advantages refer to the unique assets and capabilities that a\ncompany possesses, Location advantages pertain to the attractiveness of the host market, and\nInternalization advantages assess whether certain activities should be conducted within the\ncompany rather than outsourced.\n\nAdditionally, Institutional Theory offers insights into the challenges international companies\nface while dealing with institutional environments in developing countries. Institutions, both\nformal and informal, shape the business landscape and often create hurdles for foreign firms.\nCompanies must understand and navigate local norms, regulations, and practices to establish\nlegitimacy and gain a competitive edge (DiMaggio & Powell, 1983). This theory emphasizes\nthe role of isomorphism and legitimacy in influencing corporate strategies and behaviors in\nunfamiliar institutional settings. However, challenges cannot be solely attributed to external\nfactors. Resource Dependence Theory underscores the significance of resources, both internal\nand external, in shaping a firm's behavior and outcomes (Pfeffer 1978). When entering\ndeveloping countries like Uganda, international companies may lack the necessary local\nresources, networks, and relationships required for effective market entry and operation. This\ntheory directs attention to the importance of forging alliances, partnerships, and\ncollaborations with local entities to overcome resource constraints. The challenges faced by\ninternational companies making entry into developing countries like Uganda can be\ncomprehensively understood through the lens of Market Entry Theory, bolstered by insights\nfrom Institutional Theory and Resource Dependence Theory. These theories collectively\nilluminate how the strategic choices, ownership advantages, institutional interactions, and\nresource dynamics impact a company's ability to successfully navigate the intricate landscape\nof international expansion.\n2.3 Characteristics of International Companies\nThe term \"international companies\" is often ascribed to businesses that embark on\ninternationalization during their early stages. These enterprises exhibit a distinctive trait in\ntheir pursuit and intent to expand globally, which marked the emergence of the international\ncompany phenomenon about two decades ago. According to Cavusgil (2015), international\ncompanies are essentially young small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that, despite\nresource limitations, aspire to internationalize their operations and achieve growth.\nLeadership within international companies is typically characterized by founders or\nemployees who actively champion international expansion, with an underlying\nentrepreneurial orientation permeating the entire organizational structure. Taylor and Jack\n(2013) posit that this entrepreneurial drive assumes paramount significance for firms\nexpanding into developing countries. Paradoxically, despite resource constraints that often\nchallenge the smooth operation of international companies in such contexts; these entities", "word_count": 388, "start_char": 19734, "end_char": 22783}

An innovative\nculture emerges as a crucial factor in their success within developing markets, facilitating\nearly internationalization compared to firms lacking such a culture. This culture also equips\ninternational companies to contend with rivals on an international scale. The inherent\nflexibility and reduced bureaucracy characteristic of international companies enable a\nconducive environment for fostering innovation (Knight, Cavusgil et al., 2004). Despite their\nchallenges in adapting to new markets in developing countries, these companies have\ndemonstrated the ability to effectively compete internationally. This is partially attributed to\ntheir capacity to harness knowledge-based capabilities, engage in strategic alliances and\ncollaborations, and judiciously utilize foreign resources for manufacturing and marketing\n(Knight, Cavusgil et al., 2004; Knight, 2015). In essence, international companies exhibit\ninherent entrepreneurial and innovative traits, bolstered by dynamic capabilities such as\ninnovation, learning, and networking, which collectively empower them to thrive in\ndeveloping country markets.\n2.3.1 Internationalization Process\nThe process of internationalization undertaken by international companies, particularly their\nexpansion into developing countries, is often delineated through various dimensions that\ncapture their uniqueness (Knight, 2005). Two pertinent dimensions, elucidated by Øyna, Alon\net al. (2018), hold particular relevance for describing this internationalization process and\nmarket expansion.\nSpeed of Internationalization\nThe swiftness of internationalization in the context of venturing into developing countries\nsignifies the time from inception to the commencement of the internationalization process\n(Øyna, Alon et al., 2018). This velocity of internationalization is the hallmark distinguishing\ninternational companies. Unlike organizations that gradually evolve from domestic entities to\nmultinational conglomerates, international companies commence with a proactive\ninternational strategy from their very inception (Oviatt, McDougall et al., 1994). In line with\nthis, internationalization, particularly the pursuit of new markets in developing countries, is", "word_count": 355, "start_char": 22499, "end_char": 25319}
{"chunk_id": "DOC0005__00009", "doc_id": "DOC0005", "chunk_index": 9, "text": "his velocity of internationalization is the hallmark distinguishing\ninternational companies.U\n\nnlike organizations that gradually evolve from domestic entities to\nmultinational conglomerates, international companies commence with a proactive\ninternational strategy from their very inception (Oviatt, McDougall et al., 1994).I\n\nn line with\nthis, internationalization, particularly the pursuit of new markets in developing countries, is\n\ninitiated promptly, often at or near the founding of the company. This early proactive stance\nsets them apart from their counterparts and characterizes their unique approach.\nScope of Internationalization\nThe scope of internationalization encompasses the global diversity of a company's\nengagement, reflecting the number and geographic dispersion of international markets\nentered (Øyna, Alon et al., 2018). While international companies are associated with broad\nglobal engagement due to the term \"international\" itself, a nuanced perspective reveals that\nmany begin as localized or regionally-focused entities. Despite the seemingly expansive\nlabel, these companies frequently commence operations in their home market, subsequently\nexpanding incrementally to neighboring regions. Oviatt and McDougall (1994) assert that\ntheir motivation for international expansion emanates from competitive pressures in the\ndomestic market and the allure of new opportunities in developing countries. It's worth noting\nthat international companies often derive a significant portion of their international revenue\nfrom culturally and institutionally similar neighboring markets due to shared customer\npreferences and ease of expansion (Øyna, Alon, 2018).\nInternational companies embody a unique breed of entrepreneurial and innovative entities that\nnavigate international markets with dynamic capabilities. The process of internationalization\nthey undertake involves a swift initiation, driven by their proactive orientation, and a scope\nthat starts regionally and gradually expands across culturally and institutionally similar\nmarkets. These characteristics, underpinned by a penchant for innovation and strategic\nalliances, enable them to flourish in the intricate landscapes of developing country markets.\n\n2.4 Possible challenges faced by international companies in developing\ncountries\nThe existing literature falls short in fully elucidating the potential challenges that international\ncompanies encounter when pursuing internationalization, especially as they establish\nbranches in particular nations such as Uganda (Baum, Schwens, et al., 2013). While past\nresearch, as concluded by scholars, indicates that contemporary international companies\nmight not confront the same obstacles as posited in earlier internationalization theories\n(Oviatt & McDougall, 1994; Cavusgil, 2004), there is a distinct shift in the challenges faced.\nTraditional hindrances like cultural shock, limited experience, and constrained resources", "word_count": 382, "start_char": 24885, "end_char": 27834}

By leveraging their inherent entrepreneurial spirit and innovative\ncapacities, international companies can surmount conventional barriers to expansion and\ngrowth, thereby achieving success in both developing markets and on the global stage.\nBuilding upon the foundation established by earlier literature concerning the\ninternationalization of companies, the attainment of international success involves not only\nthe internationalization of activities but also a broader presence across various countries.\nAchieving such a feat, as numerous studies illustrate, often hinges on factors such as\nnetworks, partnerships (Cavusgil, 2004), and market-specific knowledge (Evangelista, 2006;\nKarra, Phillips, et al., 2008).\nIt is worth noting that the majority of research on the internationalization of companies into\ndeveloping nations has predominantly concentrated on identifying the factors that lead to\nsuccessful expansion and internationalization. However, this study posits that international\ncompanies are still confronted with hitherto unexplored challenges. Given the altered\ncircumstances, the challenges encountered by international companies are likely to deviate\nfrom those associated with traditional internationalization models. Therefore, drawing from\nexisting literature on international market expansion, the theoretical underpinning of our\nstudy centers on the contention that the absence of 1) networks, 2) partnerships, and 3)\nmarketspecific knowledge could potentially hinder the endeavors of international companies\nexpanding into developing countries\n2.4.1 Networks\nPrevious literature and studies have frequently emphasized the significance of networks in\nshaping the success of international companies during the process of internationalization\n(Felzensztein et al., 2015). Yet, the literature falls short in providing a practical organizational\ndefinition of networks. Therefore, for the purposes of this study, we adopt the ego network\ndefinition put forth by Smith, Collins, and Clark (2005). In this context, networks refer to\n\"the number of direct contacts an international company possesses within its employees' ego\nnetworks, particularly within the new setting of developing countries\" (Smith, 2005). While\nthe organizational aspect lacks a similar definition, we extend the individual-level definition\nto the organizational realm, specifically focusing on international companies in developing\ncountries, albeit with certain modifications (Felzensztein et al., 2015). The strength of ties is", "word_count": 395, "start_char": 27461, "end_char": 30464}

Consequently, networks are\nconceived as \"the quantity of contacts an international company maintains within its\nemployees' ego networks.\" Research underscores that the greater the reliance on networks,\nespecially akin to the approach adopted by newly established global enterprises, the higher\nthe likelihood of successfully targeting and establishing a foothold in multiple foreign\nmarkets. Moreover, studies reveal that networks serve as a means for international companies\nto overcome inherent limitations such as their relatively small scale, foreign status, and\nnewcomer status in global markets—especially in the context of entering developing nations\nlike Uganda. Hence, our investigation commences with the hypothesis that the absence of\nrobust networks could pose a challenge to the triumph of international companies venturing\ninto developing countries.\n\n2.4.2 Partnerships\nThe concept of partnerships entails collaborative agreements between two or more entities—\nsuch as suppliers, distributors, customers, countries, or other stakeholders—with the shared\ngoal of achieving mutual objectives. The establishment of partnerships with significant\nforeign customers or suppliers can facilitate the expansion of international companies into\ndeveloping countries and novel international markets. Such partnerships offer opportunities\nfor risk and cost sharing (Freeman, 2006). This aligns with the assertion of Cavusgil (2004)\nthat the high uncertainties associated with entering developing countries and novel foreign\nmarkets can be mitigated through the utilization of the competencies of local distributors—a\npivotal factor in the attainment of international success for companies. Further studies argue\nthat forming partnerships or alliances with local counterparts not only enhances marketspecific knowledge but also embeds companies within the new local milieu.

According to Karra, Phillips, and Tracey (2008), possessing\nintricate knowledge about the target market is pivotal for the performance and international\nsuccess of international companies. A distinctive characteristic of international companies is\ntheir rapid acquisition of international experience, a process that traditional companies might\ntake years to achieve (Knight, 2004). This is primarily attributed to the agility and capacity of\ninternational companies to rapidly expand their presence across diverse countries, a feat that\ntraditional counterparts might struggle to replicate. Other studies, similar to the\naforementioned, underscore that even if the leadership of an international company lacks\nprior familiarity with the local market, strategies are employed to ensure that the team\npossesses the requisite knowledge to navigate the novel business landscape in the developing\ncountry—this could involve ensuring that board members possess enhanced insight into the\nsocio-cultural and political context (Schwens et al., 2013). However, given that international\ncompanies frequently operate with limited human resources (Cavusgil et al., 2015), the\nacquisition of comprehensive knowledge about multiple international markets might be\nconstrained. Thus, our investigation posits that the lack of market-specific knowledge might\npresent a challenge to international companies.\nThis study underscores that while previous research has primarily focused on the factors that\nfacilitate successful internationalization, international companies may encounter uncharted\nchallenges in their expansion into developing countries. The absence of strong networks,\neffective partnerships, and comprehensive market-specific knowledge might hinder the\nprogress and success of international companies in this context.

PRESENTATION AND ANALYSIS OF FINDINGS\n4.1 Background of firms\nThis study derives its empirical insights from two prominent companies, KFC and MTN,\noperating within Uganda's dynamic market (Kigozi, 2014). These companies span different\nsectors, with KFC representing the food service industry and MTN being a\ntelecommunications giant (Kasule et al., 2020). Their presence in Uganda underscores their\ncommitment to contributing to the local economy and providing valuable products and\nservices to consumers across the country (Okello, 2021).", "word_count": 347, "start_char": 36727, "end_char": 39155}

As\npart of Yum! Brands, Inc., one of the world's largest restaurant companies, KFC's entry\nmarked a significant shift in Uganda's fast-food industry (Kasule et al., 2020). With an\ninvestment of approximately $5 million, KFC rapidly established a substantial footprint in the\ncountry, operating multiple outlets. This investment translated into employment opportunities\nfor over 250 Ugandans, spanning roles from kitchen staff to management positions (Kigozi,\n2014). KFC's commitment to the Ugandan market is further underlined by its annual revenue,\nwhich stood at approximately UGX 20 billion in 2022. Its contribution to Uganda's food\nservices sector is undeniable, reflecting not only its financial impact but also its influence on\nlocal dining preferences (Lubega et al., 2019).\n\nMTN (Mobile Telecommunications Network) is a prominent telecommunications company\nheadquartered in Johannesburg, South Africa, MTN initiated its operations in Uganda in\n1998. Operating under the larger MTN Group, which spans numerous African and Middle\nEastern countries, MTN ranks among the continent's largest mobile network operators\n(Kasule et al., 2020) MTN Uganda offers a wide spectrum of telecommunications services,\nencompassing mobile voice and data services, internet connectivity, and mobile financial\nservices via its Mobile Money platform. The company has played a transformative role in\nUganda's communication landscape, facilitating access to information and financial services\nfor millions of Ugandans (Kigozi, 2014).\nTo fortify its position in Uganda, MTN has invested over $500 million in developing a robust\nand dependable mobile network infrastructure. This investment extends to employment, as\nthe company provides opportunities for over 1,500 Ugandans across various capacities.\nFurthermore, MTN's network of agents and dealers contributes to job creation and economic\nempowerment in Uganda (Lubega et al., 2019). In 2022, MTN Uganda reported a substantial\nsubscriber base exceeding 15 million customers and an annual revenue of approximately\nUGX 2 trillion, reaffirming its pivotal role in Uganda's telecommunications sector. Beyond its\ncommercial endeavors, MTN Uganda is also engaged in community development initiatives,\nspanning education, healthcare, and environmental sustainability, thereby solidifying its status\nas a significant contributor to Uganda's socio-economic development (Kigozi, 2014).", "word_count": 397, "start_char": 38820, "end_char": 41655}

Uganda's rich multicultural tapestry poses intricate challenges necessitating a\nnuanced approach for market entry (Kasule et al., 2020).\nThe presence of diverse ethnic groups and languages in Uganda mandates a comprehensive\nunderstanding of local customs, greetings, and traditions. International companies, such as\nMTN, must navigate this complexity while respecting linguistic diversity and addressing\nlanguage barriers. Moreover, alignment with traditional economic practices and community\nengagement emerge as essential strategies to gain acceptance and thrive in this culturally\nvibrant yet challenging market (Okello, 2021).\nConsumer preferences in Uganda exhibit significant regional variations, adding a layer of\ncomplexity for international companies. To navigate this landscape, localized market research\n\nbecomes\nindispensable,\nenabling\ncompanies\nlike\nMTN\nto\ntailor\ntheir\nmobile\ntelecommunications services to cater to the specific demands of different Ugandan\npopulations (Lubega et al., 2019).\nMoreover, distinct gender roles and ethical considerations in Uganda demand that\ninternational companies exercise mindfulness and respect local norms and values. Building\ntrust and nurturing enduring relationships with local partners and stakeholders become\nparamount in achieving success within this diverse cultural context (Kasule et al., 2020).", "word_count": 251, "start_char": 41378, "end_char": 43322}

These included securing permits and licenses essential for operating fast-food\nrestaurants. A comprehensive understanding of Ugandan laws and compliance requirements,\nencompassing aspects like taxation and trade regulations, was imperative for KFC to ensure a\nseamless market entry process (Kasule et al., 2020).\nAdditionally, government policies, such as trade restrictions and taxation, significantly\ninfluenced KFC's business operations and profitability in Uganda. Maintaining transparency\nin dealings with Ugandan regulators and officials emerged as a crucial strategy to avoid legal\ncomplications and foster a favorable regulatory environment (Lubega et al., 2019). While For\nMTN, entering the Ugandan market entailed grappling with various regulatory and legal\nchallenges (Okello, 2021). These included bureaucratic red tape leading to delays in securing\napprovals and licenses for its telecommunications operations. Furthermore, MTN had to\nnavigate the issue of corruption, with demands for bribes or unofficial fees to expedite\nprocesses (Kasule et al., 2020).\nWeak contract enforcement, particularly concerning intellectual property rights and\ncontractual obligations, posed challenges for MTN. Moreover, political instability in Uganda,\nparticularly during election periods, had the potential to impact MTN's operations,\nnecessitating adaptability in response to changing circumstances and effective risk\nmanagement (Lubega et al., 2019).\n\n4.4 Findings on Competition Dynamics and Market Entry Barriers Faced by\nInternational Companies like TechGlobal in developing countries\nThis section presents findings related to competition dynamics and market entry barriers\nencountered by international companies like KFC when venturing into developing countries\n(Kasule et al., 2020). Competition dynamics and market entry barriers in Uganda prove to be\nmultifaceted and complex, as exemplified by KFC's experiences (Okello, 2021). The presence\nof robust local competition, deeply entrenched in the market, poses a formidable challenge.\nHigh entry costs, including taxes and import duties, further elevate the barriers to entry\n(Lubega et al., 2019).\nRegulatory protectionism measures favoring domestic industries impact the competitive\nlandscape, adding an additional layer of complexity. International companies like KFC must\nemploy a well-crafted blend of localization, community engagement, and astute marketing to\nestablish a competitive edge and secure a foothold in the market.", "word_count": 448, "start_char": 42974, "end_char": 46293}

One of the primary economic market risks for international companies like MTN in\ndeveloping countries like Uganda is the exposure to currency and exchange rate fluctuations\n(Okello, 2021). These markets often exhibit higher volatility in their currencies, which can\nimpact the profitability of the business (Lubega et al., 2019). Fluctuations in exchange rates\ncan lead to increased costs for infrastructure investment, network expansion, and technology\nupgrades, potentially affecting profit margins. Moreover, the depreciation of the local\ncurrency can influence the purchasing power of consumers, potentially affecting their ability\nto afford telecommunications services from a foreign provider like MTN.\nTo mitigate this risk, companies needed to employ effective currency risk management\nstrategies, such as hedging, to protect their bottom line and maintain price stability for\nconsumers.\n\n5. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n5.1 CONCLUSION\n\nThis comprehensive study has provided valuable insights into the intricate landscape of\nchallenges faced by international companies such as KFC and MTN when venturing into\nUganda's emerging market. Through a meticulous analysis of various sources, including\nmarket analyses, governmental reports, and enlightening case studies, the study has unveiled\nthe complexities these companies encounter. The strategic approaches they employ to\novercome these formidable obstacles have also been highlighted.\nA compelling illustration within this complex landscape is KFC's and MTN's journey. As a\nfast-food restaurant chain and a telecommunications giant, they faced unique challenges\nwhen entering Uganda, including fierce competition from local food vendors and telecom\nproviders, regulatory complexities, and the need for substantial infrastructure investment.\nKFC and MTN exemplify the importance of local alliances, tailored strategies, capacity\nenhancement, and corporate social responsibility in establishing a foothold in Uganda. Their\nsuccessful partnerships with local businesses, adaptation to local needs, investment in local\nworkforce development, and engagement in meaningful CSR initiatives showcase the\nsignificance of adaptive strategies that contribute not only to market entry but also to\nUganda's economic growth and social development.\n\nThe findings from this in-depth study shed light on the multifaceted challenges faced by\ninternational companies in Uganda's promising market.
