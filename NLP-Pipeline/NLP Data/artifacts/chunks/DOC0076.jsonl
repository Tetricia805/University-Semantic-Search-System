Suppose you have a table listing\nthe population of some country in 1970, 1980, 1990 and 2000, and that you want to estimate\nthe population in 1994. Linear interpolation gives you an easy way to do this.\nThe basic operation of linear interpolation between two values is so commonly used in computer\ngraphics that it is sometimes called a lerp in the jargon of computer graphics. The term can\nbe used as a verb or noun for the operation. e.g. ”Bresenham’s algorithm lerps incrementally\nbetween the two endpoints of the line.”\nLerp operations are built into the hardware of all modern computer graphics processors. They\nare often used as building blocks for more complex operations: for example, a bilinear interpolation can be accomplished in three lerps. Because this operation is cheap, it’s also a good way\nto implement accurate lookup tables with quick lookup for smooth functions without having\ntoo many table entries.\n5.1.2\nHistory\nLinear interpolation has been used since antiquity for filling the gaps in tables, often with\nastronomical data. It is believed that it was used in the Seleucid Empire (last three centuries\nBC) and by the Greek astronomer and mathematician Hipparchus (second century BC). A\ndescription of linear interpolation can be found in the Almagest (second century AD) of Ptolemy.\n5.1.3\nExtensions\nIn demanding situations, linear interpolation is often not accurate enough (since not all points\ncan be approximated to be on a straight line). In that case, it can be replaced by polynomial\ninterpolation or spline interpolation.\nLinear interpolation can also be extended to bilinear interpolation for interpolating functions\nof two variables. Bilinear interpolation is often used as a crude anti-aliasing filter. Similarly,\ntrilinear interpolation is used to interpolate functions of three variables. Other extensions of\nlinear interpolation can be applied to other kinds of mesh such as triangular and tetrahedral\nmeshes.\nPage 124 of 196", "word_count": 461, "start_char": 2630, "end_char": 5309}

How do we estimate\nthe value of the function at any point x∗; how do we compute f(x∗). In general this is done\nby developing a smooth curve though the points (x1, f(x1)), (x2, f(x2)), ...(xN, f(xN)).\nLagrange interpolation is a way to pass a polynomial of degree N −1 through N points.\nLagrange polynomials are the interpolating polynomials that equal zero in all given points,\nsave one. Say, given points x1, x2, . . . , xN, Lagrange’s polynomial number k is the product\nPk(x) = (x −x1)\n(xk −x1) · (x −x2)\n(xk −x2) · · · (x −xk−1)\n(xk −xk−1) · (x −xk+1)\n(xk −xk+1) · · · (x −xN)\n(xk −xN)\nsuch that Pk(xk) = 1 and Pk(xj) = 0, for j different from k. In terms of Lagrange’s polynomials\nthe polynomial interpolation through the points (x1, y1), (x2, y2), . . . , (xN, yN) could be defined\nsimply as\nP(x) = y1P1(x) + y2P2(x) + ... + yNPN(x)\nDefinition 5.2.1\nPolynomial interpolation is a method of constructing a function and estimating values at non-tabular points between x0 and xn.\n5.2.0.1\nAlternatively\nLet f(x) be a continuous function on [a, b], such that\nf(xk) = f(xk),\nk = 0, 1, ..., n,\nwith xk ∈[a, b]. We call the set of points {xk} tabular points (or interpolating points), while\nthe set of values {f(xk)} are called the tabular values of f(x). We seek for a polynomial of\ndegree n, such that\nPn(xk) = f(xk), for k = 0, 1, 2, . . . n.\n(5.3)\nSuch a polynomial is called Lagrange’s interpolation polynomial.\nHowever, the process of\ncalculating f(x), x ∈[a, b], x ̸= xk ∀k from 0 to n, is called interpolation.\nWe now proceed to derive a formula for Pn(x). However, there is need to introduce some key\ndefinitions.\nDefinition 5.2.2\nLet {Dk : k = 0, 1, ..., n} be any set of numbers. We define the products;\nn\nY\nk=0\nDk = D0.D1...Dn\nand\nn\nY\nj=0\nj̸=k\nDk = D0.D1...Dj−1.Dj+1...Dn\n.\nThis definition is important in the following defining equation for Lagrange’s interpolating\npolynomial.\nPage 125 of 196", "word_count": 441, "start_char": 4897, "end_char": 7318}
