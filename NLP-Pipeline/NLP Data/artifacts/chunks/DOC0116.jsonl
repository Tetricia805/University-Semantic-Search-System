The implementation phase is a crucial step in the development process as it brings\nthe conceptual design of the app to life and allows for practical assessment and evaluation.\n\n5.2Print Screen\nThe following illustrations show how the user interacts with the bus ticketing application.\nThis page is the first page of the application once opened. It shows the home page, the make\nbooking page, check tickets page, register and log in page. If the user has an account will then\nlog in, if not will have to register to access other features of the application.\n\nThis page shows the customer register page if they don’t have an account they can create one\nfrom here and then after that proceed to the log in page to get access into the system\n\nThis page shows the Customer log in panel once they have an account they can log in, it also\nshows the register button in case they don’t have an account they can register and also this page\nshows the admin log in button for the admin to log into the application\n\nAfter logging in the client can now be able to access the application and then therefore make\ntheir bookings respectively. They can select the date, origin, destination and they can see various\navailable routes that are available and they can then search for tickets.\nAfter selecting the date, origin and destination they can then proceed and select seats basing on\nwhat they want and also the clients can be able to see what bus they will use, the arrival time and\nthe price\n\nThis shows the route, destination terminal, date and time selected, the seats of the passenger, the\nprice and then after the client proceeds to another page\n\nAfter that the clients ticket booking code will be displayed and can either download the Q-R\ncode or then check payment for the ticket.\n\nThis page the client can make payments for their tickets using their bank account number and\nthey select a bank and also attach a transaction photo as proof of payment.\n\nAfter inserting payment details this is the confirmation page that shows the bank and account\nnumber to make the client to be sure of their payment.", "word_count": 425, "start_char": 35540, "end_char": 38012}

If their ticket\nhas been accepted a green box will show accepting them to print the ticket online but if it has\nbeen declined then they are advised to boo another ticket.\n\nAfter the payments and the ticket being approved by the administration then the client can print\nthe ticket and proceed to the bus station.\n\n5.3 System testing\nFunctionality Testing:\n• Verify that users can search for available bus routes and schedules.\n• Test the booking process, including seat selection, fare calculation, and payment integration.\n• Validate the cancellation and refund process.\n• Ensure that user authentication, registration, and login functionalities work as expected.\nCompatibility Testing:\n• Test the app on different devices (e.g., smartphones, tablets) and operating systems\n(e.g., Android, iOS) to ensure compatibility.\n• Check the app's responsiveness and compatibility with various screen sizes and resolutions.\nPerformance Testing:\n• Assess the app's performance under normal and peak load conditions.\n• Test response times for search queries, seat selection, and booking confirmation.\n• Evaluate how the app handles simultaneous bookings and high traffic situations.\n\n5.4 Validation\n1. User Registration:\no Verify that all required fields (e.g., name, email, password) are filled in.\no Validate the email format (e.g., check for proper email syntax).\no Check that the password meets the specified criteria (e.g., minimum length, presence of special characters).\n\n2. Bus Selection:\no Ensure that the selected origin and destination are different.\no Validate that the selected departure and return dates are in the future.\no Check that the number of passengers selected is within the allowed range.\no Verify that the selected bus route is available.\n\n3. Seat Selection:\no Validate that the selected seats are not already booked by other users.\no Ensure that the selected seats are within the available seating layout for the chosen bus.\no Check that the selected seats are adjacent (if required) for passengers traveling together.", "word_count": 404, "start_char": 37695, "end_char": 40230}

Error Handling:\no Display appropriate error messages for any invalid or missing inputs.\no Validate that the user has entered a valid email address for communication purposes.\no Ensure that the user receives error messages if there are any connectivity issues or\nserver errors.\n\n5.5 limitations\n• Limited Coverage: Not all bus operators and routes may be fully covered by bus ticketing\napplications. Users' selections may be constrained by certain applications' restricted\nrelationships or agreements with particular bus operators. If consumers are seeking for\nless traveled routes or certain bus companies, this might be a drawback.\n• Bus ticketing applications mainly rely on internet access to deliver real-time information\nand ticket purchasing services, which might cause connectivity and network issues. Users\ncould have trouble opening the app or completing their bookings in places with spotty\nnetwork coverage or during network outages.\n• Payment Options and Security: Although many bus ticket booking applications include a\nvariety of payment methods, some customers may have restrictions if their chosen\npayment method isn't accepted. Users may also be concerned about the security of their\nfinancial information and the app's capacity to fend against data breaches and illegal\naccess.\n• Absence of Customer assistance: Some apps for purchasing bus tickets may have few or\nineffective customer assistance options. Users may encounter difficulties asking for help\nor resolving problems with their reservations, which can cause irritation and\ndisappointment.\n\nChapter 6\n6.0 Introduction\nIn this chapter, we will provide recommendations, draw conclusions, and present a summary for\nthe bus ticket booking app.", "word_count": 397, "start_char": 39955, "end_char": 42509}
