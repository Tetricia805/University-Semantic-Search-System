The\nstudy aims at assessing the use of magnesium chloride as a dust suppressant on unpaved\nroads in Uganda with the focus on Bbaale-Galilaya road in Kayunga district due to high\ndust levels on this road which reduces visibility resulting into accidents. So the material\naims at the reducing on particulate matter to correspond with the air quality standards\nof Environment Protection Agency (EPA) and World Health Organization (WHO).The\nstudy identifies key and specific objectives such as Assessing the use of magnesium\nchloride as a dust suppressant as the main objective and determining the concentration\nof particulate matter present in dust, assessing the properties of magnesium chloride\nand the optimum amount required to suppress the dust levels along Bbaale-Galilaya\nroad. On Bbaale-Galilaya road, the particulate matter was above the environmental\nprotection agency (EPA) and the World Health Organization (WHO) standards which\nincluded 84.485/m3, 115.835/m3,138.5/m3, 128.5/m3 and 111.165/m3 at various\ndistances of 50m, 100m, 150, 200m and 250m which were 50m apart or away from each\nother. After magnesium chloride application, the optimum percentage attained or\nobtained was 15% of the magnesium chloride solution which achieved the environmental\nprotection agency compliance with a particulate matter of 28.5/m3 which is below 35\nstandard for environmental protection agency therefore balancing environmental\nsafety and indicating a 80% reduction in particulate matter present in dust along Bbaale-\nGalilaya road in Kayunga district.\n\nii\n\nDECLARATION\nI hereby declare to the best of my knowledge that the content in here are mine and\nhave not been shared to any university or any learning institution\nMUKABYA REAGAN\nSIGNATURE: ........................................\n\niii\n\nAPPROVAL\nThis final year project has been studied, analyzed and submitted by MUKABYA REAGAN,\nS21B32/011 with approval to the department of engineering and environment at Uganda\nChristian university for Examination\nSIGNATURE: ...............................

This dust is made up of various substances such as pollen, dead\nskin cells, viruses, bacteria, fungal spores etc. and the different forms of dust include\ninorganic dust which is derived from mineral such as silica, asbestos and heavy metals,\norganic dust which is obtained from biological sources for example pollen fungal spores,\ncombustion derived dust, aerosol dust and many others. (Madapusi et al., 2020). This\ndust however has various effects on humans such as respiratory problems like asthma,\nallergies, ski and eye irritation etc. and environmental impacts which affects climate,\nair quality and water resources (Shang et al., 2020).\nDifferent mitigation measures have been put in place globally by the World Health\nOrganization (WHO), to reduce dust emissions, such as setting guidelines for air quality\n(WHO, 2020). However, in African countries, for example Uganda, dust has been\nregulated through organizations such as the National Environment Management\nAuthority (NEMA) and Uganda National Roads Authority (UNRA), which regulate dust\nemissions and maintain roads (NEMA, 2019). UNRA reduces dust accumulation by\napplying bitumen and other substances to roads and implementing various dust control\nmeasures, such as the application of water, which binds dust particles and prevents\ntheir release into the atmosphere (UNRA, 2021).", "word_count": 447, "start_char": 8440, "end_char": 12737}

PROBLEM STATEMENT.\nDust is a prevalent tragedy on many roads in Uganda today more especially on the\nunpaved or gravel roads, this dust is composed of different particles sizes therefore it\nis lost as a fine material referred to as particulate matter i.e. PM10 and PM2.5 (Barnes,\n2021).Dust levels are normally high during the dry seasons due to heavy trucks and other\nvehicles which disintegrate the soil particles down on the ground and they become\nairborne resulting into high dust levels which later gives rise to air pollution.\nBbaale-Galilaya road which has a stretch of approximately 85kilometres in Kayunga\ndistrict experiences a challenge of high dust levels which reduces on the visibility of\nthe pedestrians, cyclists and other road users resulting into accidents (Raihan, 2021).\nThe number of accidents on this road is however increasing due to lack of enough vision\nby mostly the cyclists and pedestrians as they sometimes fail to see the high speeding\nvehicles and trucks resulting into collisions or head ons and this are mainly due to the\nhigh concentration of dust particles along this road (Juuko, 2023).\nDifferent measures have been put in place along this road to mitigate this tragedy such\nas the application of water to suppress the high dust levels but however this has not\nbeen all that effective as the dust rises few hours after its application.\nThis study therefore aims at the use of a salt based chemical known as MAGNESIUM\nCHLORIDE due to the different properties it has for effective dust suppression such as\nhygroscopic and deliquescent properties which enables it to absorb moisture from the\nair that it use during binding action and stabilization of the soil particles thereby\nholding them on the ground ( Murata et al., 2023).", "word_count": 329, "start_char": 12488, "end_char": 14504}

Main Objective\nTo assess the use of magnesium chloride as a dust suppressant along Bbaale-Galilaya\nroad\n1.3.2. Specific Objectives\n1.

What are the different properties of magnesium chloride?\n3. What is the optimum amount of magnesium chloride needed to suppress dust?\n1.5. JUSTIFICATION\nMagnesium chloride is an inorganic salt compound composed of one magnesium and two\nchloride ions i.e. MgCl2. (Zhitao, 2024). When it’s applied or added to the soil, it\nattracts and retains moisture from the air since it’s a hygroscopic material and this\nforms a liquid solution which helps it to bind with the fine particles thereby reducing\non the dust particles on the road hence suppressing more dust particles per gallon\ncompared to water (Kakinaga et al., 2023).\n\nMagnesium chloride has a high affinity for water molecules due to their ionic and polar\nnature therefore it is composed of both positive and negative ions i.e. magnesium and\nchloride ions respectively which are highly polar which implies that they attract polar\nwater molecules and attraction occurs through “ion-dipole” interactions where Positive\nand negative ends of water molecules are drawn to opposite charges on the ions (Shukla\net al.,2020).\nMagnesium chloride mode of application on this road will be through spraying since it\nwill be applied in a liquid form or solutions and sprayed on the road surface using\nspecialized equipment such as trucks mounted with spray nozzles(Bingyi et al.,2022)\nand the following are the different reactions of magnesium chloride with water and\ntemperature.\n1.5.1. Reaction with Water\nMagnesium chloride solution is soluble in water therefore it reacts with water\nmolecules giving rise to hydrolysis reaction which is as follows\nMgCl2 (aq)+2H2O(l) Mg(OH)2 (s) + 2HCL(aq)\nAnd also forms a hexahydrate compound as part of its structure known as Magnesium\nchloride hexahydrate\nMgCl2+6H2O→MgCl2⋅6H2O\n1.5.2. Reaction at high temperatures\nWhen magnesium chloride is exposed to high temperatures, it solidifies but due to its\nhygroscopic property it will absorb more moisture from the atmosphere which takes it", "word_count": 379, "start_char": 14504, "end_char": 16977}

The quantity of magnesium chloride to be applied however varies\ndepending on several factors such as traffic volume, road width, road surface type\ntherefore on Bbaale-Galilaya road since it’s a medium traffic road the quantity of\nmagnesium chloride per kilometer applied will range between 2500 to 4000 liters or\n660 to 1056 gallons for effective dust suppression and this will help in the binding action\nof the soil particles down on the ground thereby preventing their rise into air which in\nthe end improves the visibility for road thereby minimizing on the accidents caused due\nto high dust levels and at the same time mitigating air pollution (Yong et al., 2022).\n1.6.

This is because water absorption increases the dust\nparticle weight which makes them less likely to be suspended in air ( Madapusi\net al., 2020)\n✓ Lowers dust cloud formation. This is because water wets dust particles which\nprevents them from becoming airborne (Puppala et al.,2019)\nDuring this dust suppression, water application rates vary depending on the light,\nmedium and heavy dust control therefore its applied through various methods which\ninclude spraying , misting and use of irrigation systems(Yulong, 2020) and after being\napplied, dust is suppressed through agglomeration where the water causes dust\nparticles to clump together thereby increasing their size and weight which prevents\nthem from being re-suspended into the atmosphere (Sanjay, 2021).\nDust however accumulates again few hours of approximately 1 to 3hours after its\napplication since water is effective for short term dust suppression (Wang et al, 2019)as\nit suppresses dust to a percentage of 50-70% making it less effective compared to\nMagnesium chloride which as a long term dust suppression period as it suppresses dust\non a long run to a period of approximately 1 to 7 days after its application which 80 to\n95% effectiveness and also suppresses more dust per gallon compared to water.", "word_count": 311, "start_char": 21083, "end_char": 22984}

Size and Penetration\nPM10\nPM10 is composed of larger particles up to 10 μm in diameter and penetrates the\nupper respiratory tract, nose, throat, and bronchi but is often trapped by natural\ndefenses like nasal hair or mucus. PM10 cause irritation of the eyes, nose etc. (WHO,\n2021).\nPM2.5\nPM2.5 consists of smaller particles of 2.5 μm or less in diameter and penetrates\ndeeper into the lungs and can reach the alveoli, the tiny air sacs responsible for gas\nexchange in the lungs (EPA, 2020). PM2.5 can enter the bloodstream which affects the\ncardiovascular system and other organs (WHO, 2021).\nTherefore, in conclusion basing on size and penetration, PM2.5 is more dangerous\nbecause its smaller size allows it to penetrate deeper into the body.\n2.6. CHEMICAL COMPOSITION AND TOXICITY\nPM10\nThis consists of coarse particles from natural sources such as soil, dust, and pollen and\ncarries toxic substances that are less concentrated compared to PM2.5.\nPM2.5\nThis Contains finer particles often originating from combustion processes, including\nvehicle emissions, industrial processes, and burning fossil fuels.\nPM2.5 carries more toxic compounds such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs),\n\nheavy metals, and sulfates which have a higher potential for causing harm (Chen et\nal., 2020).Therefore PM2.5 poses greater health risks due to its higher toxicity\ncompared to PM2.5\n\n2.7. HEALTH EFFECTS\nPM10. PM10 irritates the eyes, nose, throat, and upper respiratory tract and\nwith long exposure, it causes respiratory diseases such as asthma and\nbronchitis. (NIOSH, 2020)\nPM2.5\nPM2.5 is associated with more serious health effects which includes increased risk of\nheart attacks and strokes, worsening of chronic diseases like asthma therefore Longterm exposure has been linked to reduced lung function and cancer. (WHO, 2021;\nSamet & Spengler, 2018).\nIn conclusion PM2.5 has more serious and systemic health effects than PM10.\n2.8.

MAGNESIUM CHLORIDE AS A DUST SUPPRESSANT\nThis is an inorganic salt chemical compound which is composed of magnesium ions and\nchloride ions with 23.3% and atomic mass of 24.305g/mol and 76.7% with atomic mass\nof 35.453g/mol respectively. It is used as a dust suppressant because of its effectiveness\nand environmental benefits which makes it desirable during dust suppression.\n2.9.1. Properties of magnesium chloride.\nPhysical Properties\nMagnesium chloride is highly hygroscopic, meaning it absorbs moisture from the\natmosphere, which is critical for its effectiveness in binding fine dust particles (Chase,\n2021). It exists as a crystalline solid, typically colorless, and forms hydrates like\n\nmagnesium chloride hexahydrate (MgCl2·6H2O) under humid conditions. These hydrates\nenhance its ability to retain moisture, crucial for stabilizing dust on roads (NIST, 2023).\nThe compound has a melting point of 714°C and is highly soluble in water hence easily\napplied in liquid solutions (USGS, 2023).\nChemical Properties\nWhen dissolved in water, magnesium chloride dissociates into magnesium (Mg2+) and\nchloride (Cl−) ions. It is these ions that, through ion-dipole interactions with dust and\nwater molecules, build a binding matrix that resists the release of dust into the air\n(Chase, 1998). Under certain conditions, this chemical also reacts with water, leading\nto hydrolysis and the formation of magnesium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid, further\nindicating the reactivity and possible impacts on specific environments (NIST, 2023).\nThermal Properties\nMagnesium chloride has very good thermal stability, with a hygroscopic capacity\nunaffected by increasing temperature; it works efficiently in a wide range of climate\nconditions. The values for heat and enthalpy have been documented in scientific\nliterature to date and supplement its ability in dust suppression and industry\napplications (NIST, 2023).\n2.9.2.

This is because it reduces dust emissions\nby 80 to 95% (Kumar et al.,2020)\n✓ Long lasting. Magnesium chloride remains effective for several months after its\napplication (Madapus et al., 2020)\n✓ Environmental friendly. It is a biodegradable and non-toxic chemical therefore\nhas no harm on the environment (EPA, 2020)\n✓ Soil stabilization.

MODE OF ACTION OF MAGNESIUM CHLORIDE DURING DUST SUPPRESSION\nMagnesium chloride mainly achieves it dust suppression effectiveness through the\nfollowing ways\nHygroscopic property\nWhen magnesium chloride is applied, it absorbs moisture from the atmosphere which it\nuses to reduce on the mobility of the dust particles (Kumar et al, 2020)\nSurface tension reduction. It then reduces on the surface tension of the absorbed\nmoisture or water molecules which enhances its ability to bind dust particles that are\nmore likely to become airborne (Chen et al, 2020)\nParticle aggregation\nIt achieves this through making dust particles heavier due to the attracted moisture\nwhich reduces on the rise of dust particles into the atmosphere. (Samet & Spengler,\n2018).\nWhat makes magnesium chloride a good dust suppressant method?\n\nMagnesium chloride is hygroscopic in nature therefore this implies that it can absorb\nwater molecules from the atmosphere that improves its binding action.(Chen et al.,\n2016). It’s composed of the magnesium and chloride ions which have strong electro\nstatic forces that its uses to pull or attract water molecules from the atmosphere. After\nwater molecules are absorbed these form a brine solution that acts a sticky coating that\nhelp to trap dust particles down onto the ground which prevents it from becoming\nairborne resulting into the deliquescent property therefore magnesium chloride is a\n\ngood dust suppressant because of its hygroscopic and deliquescent property(Kumar et\nal.,2020).\n2.9.4. COMPARISON OF MAGNESIUM CHLORIDE WITH WATER DURING DUST\nSUPPRESSION\nLong-lasting\nMagnesium chloride forms a brine solution when applied to the surface which creates a\nsticky layer on the ground thereby binding soil particles together therefore this brine\neffect is long lasting and resists evaporation and wear compared to water which tends\nto evaporate quickly and loses its effectiveness (Hammond et al.,2013)\nReduced dust resuspension\nWhen magnesium chloride is applied, it reduces dust resuspension because it form a\nthin sticky film on the surface that binds dust particles together unlike water which\ntemporarily suppresses dust as it does not have the same binding effect as magnesium\nchloride therefore results into more dust rise into the atmosphere once water\nEvaporates (Nash et al.,2010).\n\nHygroscopic nature\nMagnesium chloride is highly hygroscopic which enables it to attract and absorb\nmoisture from the air. This ability helps to keep the surface moist or damp which\nreduces the likelihood of dust particles being lifted by wind while water on the other", "word_count": 397, "start_char": 29860, "end_char": 32449}

IMPACT OF WEATHER CONDITIONS ON MAGNESIUM CHLORIDE AFTER\nAPPLICATION\nWIND\nMagnesium chloride absorbs and retains moisture due to its hygroscopic nature\ntherefore this makes the surface moist or damp and reduces on the effect of being\ncarried away by wind (Pasternald et al., 2006)\nRAIN\nModerate rain dissolves magnesium chloride and spreads it more evenly across the road\nthereby improving its ability to retain moisture and suppression of dust (Smith et al.,\n2018)\nTEMPERATURE\nIn warm temperature with moderate or high humidity, magnesium chloride attracts\nmoisture which keeps the road surface damp thus reducing dust and this is due to its\nhygroscopic property however at very high temperature i.e. temperatures above 40°C,\nrapid evaporation occurs which reduces on the moisture being absorbed by Magnesium\nchloride since the humidity in the atmosphere is low\n\nLEACHING OF CHEMICALS\nLeaching\nThis refers to the process by which soluble substances for example chemicals, minerals,\nnutrients or other contaminants are dissolved and carried away by water moving\nthrough the soil or other materials. Leaching occurs when rain water or ground water\npercolates through the soil dissolving chemicals and carrying them downwards (Brady\net al.,2016) leaching can however be addressed through use of acceptable\nconcentrations of magnesium chloride corresponding to the environmental protection\nagency EPA as this reduces on the leaching effect of the chemical after its application.\nTIME SERIES ANALYSIS TEST IN DUST SUPPRESSION.\nTime series analysis is a standard statistical methodology applied to research into\ntrends, patterns, and relationships in data gathered over time. When proposed to dust\nsuppression studies on unpaved roads, this encompasses everything regarding the\neffectiveness of the intervention through the analysis of particulate matter\nconcentrations before, during, and after the implementation of dust suppression\nmeasures.\n2.9.6. APPLICATION OF TIME-SERIES ANALYSIS TO DUST SUPPRESSION\nMonitoring of Particulate Matter Concentrations.\nThe time series data of the PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations from air quality\nmonitoring devices provide records for a time continuum that is irrefutably required\nfor the determination of dust concentration variability due to some natural causes\nsuch as wind speed, humidity, and other human activities; the quantification of the", "word_count": 414, "start_char": 32182, "end_char": 34971}

The major approaches include:\n1. Pre- and post-intervention comparison.\n✓ Detection of a trend or anomaly by fitting models like ARIMA, or Seasonal\nDecomposition of Time Series (STL).\n✓ Delineation of time lags between interventions and associated reductions in PM\nconcentrations.\n2.

High viscosity implies greater resistance to flow and low viscosity indicates\nthat the fluid flows easily without much resistance (white, 2016). The instrument used\nto measure viscosity or carry out viscosity tests is a digital viscometer as a certain\nconcentration of a solution or a fluid is poured into the digital viscometer which gives\na reading in Milli-pascal per second (Munson et al.,2018).\nViscosity involves the fluid’s resistance to flow therefore it further describes how thick\nor sticky a fluid is. Viscosity can be high or low hence a highly viscous fluid flows slowly\nfor example honey and a low viscos fluid flows with ease for example water and this\ndepends on the internal fiction between molecules in the fluid as they move past each\nother (Munson et al., 2013).Viscosity is influenced by factors such as temperature where\nheated fluids become less viscous and more viscous when cooled (cengal et al., 2014)\nX-FLUORESCENCE METHOD\nThis is a non-destructive analytical technique used to determine the elemental\ncomposition of materials for example magnesium chloride therefore this indicates the\nvarious compounds present in the magnesium chloride solution for example magnesium\noxide, chlorine ions, manganese (ii) oxide which are vital during dust suppression as\nthey increase the effectiveness of magnesium chloride during dust suppression through\nimproving on the binding action of magnesium chloride solution after being\napplied(Beckhoff et al.,2006).", "word_count": 312, "start_char": 36026, "end_char": 38101}
