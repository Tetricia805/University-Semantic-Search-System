It is a key component of insuring a company’s financial\nstability and solvency. In business anything done financially affect eventually, cash is the crucial\nfor ever business, every company has to have cash on hand or at least access to cash in order to\nbe able to pay for the goods and services it uses and consequently, to stay in the business as on\nsimple it can be said that the company has to viable of managing its day to day operation. Cash\nmovement in a business is two-way traffic, it keeps on moving in and out of business. The inflow\nor outflow of cash never coincides, the cash management is one of the effective tools to maintain\nand manage the cash which is the king of business. Cash management can be effectively done\nusing various cash management techniques which are in practice. Working of various cash\nmanagement techniques like cash flow synchronization, speeding up collection, controlling\npayments, cash flow forecasting etc. important aspect which is unique to cash management is\ntime dimension associated with the movement of cash the primary aim of cash management is to\nensure that there should be enough cash availability when the needs arises, not too much but\nnever too little.\nThe importance of SMEs has attracted a lot of international attention in recent past due to their\nsignificant contributions to the economies of both the developed and developing countries\n(Asiedu, 2006).", "word_count": 302, "start_char": 11931, "end_char": 13743}

In the European Union, almost 85% of net new jobs from 2002-2010 were created by\nSMEs (E U, 2012 European Commission, 2011; Abouzeedan, 2011; and Muhammad et al,\n2010).\nIn the United States, the effect of globalization on SMEs has received a lot of attention in\ninternational circles in the past few years. In 2004, SMEs in the U.S. employed about 25 million\npeople and their gross product was about 20 percent of the gross domestic product of private\nindustries in the U.S. (Kozlow, 2006; BEA, 2006).\nIn Asia, SMEs are very important for employment creation and are sources of economic growth\nand foreign currencies. In Indonesia, SMEs are valued for their potential to create employment,\nto generate foreign currencies through export, and their potential to grow into larger enterprises\n(Tumbunan, 2012). In India SMEs constitute over 90% of total enterprise in most of the\neconomy, generating the highest rate of employment growth and account for a major share of\nindustrial production and exports (Kumar, and Sardar, 2011).\nIn Africa SMEs are efficient and prolific job creators, the seeds of big businesses, and the fuel\nof national economic engines. From an economic perspective, however, SMEs are not just\nsuppliers, but also consumers (Abor and Quartey, 2010). SMEs make up approximately 50% of\nthe gross domestic product; have a higher production output than large companies, greater\ncapacity to innovate, a more direct impact on cultural and social issues, and a greater role to\nplay in the future growth of an economy (Belinda, 2011).\nUganda’s SMEs are considered the engine for income generation, wealth creation, poverty\nreduction through job-creation and innovation. Uganda SMEs are vital drivers of growth,\ninnovation and a source of government revenues that target poverty reduction (COMSEC,\n2011). SMEs account for over 70 percent of the country’s dominant economic force, employing\nmore man 2.5 million people, constitute 70 to 90 percent of the private sectors and contributes\nover 70% to total GDP (Kakista and Baguma, 2011; Ssempijja, 2011). The Baseline Survey\nreports on SMEs, by Uganda Investment Authority, UIA, (2011) revealed that there were over\n24,505 SMEs in Uganda, employing over 90% of the private sector work force and contributing\nsubstantially to the provision of basic goods and services. In 2011, Uganda revenue authority\ncollected up to 32% of the total revenue to the government from SMEs (Mugabe, 2012).", "word_count": 439, "start_char": 13541, "end_char": 16286}

He argued that inability to generate cash from its operations\nmay force a business to borrow more money or to dispose of its capital investments to meet its\nobligations and this may lead to involuntary bankruptcy if this situation persists over a period of\ntime.\nAccording to Percat, (2012), around 90% of SMEs failures are due to inadequate management\nof their cash flow. SMEs are especially vulnerable to cash flow problems since they operate\nwith inadequate cash reserves or none at all (Peng and Jiahai, 2005).\nCash flow management which is considered as the nucleus of a business entity for short and\nlong-term survival has remained an ongoing challenge to SMEs (Bay City Financial Solutions,\n2012; and Munusamy, 2010).\n1.2 Problem statement\nThe strength of an organization would be determined on how managers handle the daily cash\nflows. Cash flow management needs proper skills in financial management and training with\nadequate experience in resource mobilization. Much as emphases have been put on cash flow\nand financial management training and development of managers, its impact is still very low\nand managers are failing to manage cash flows in the re organization. Most upcoming SMEs\nhave faced a lot of challenges related to cash flow management thus leading to the death of\ntheir SMEs. It’s upon this background where the researcher is investigating how cash flows\nmanagement in an organization affects the financial performance of SMEs and possibly\npropose a better solutions to this challenges.\nThe process of managing cash has become a major challenge for most of the companies, because\nof its significant impact on the results of a company. The success of any business venture is\npredicted on how the management has planned and controlled its cash flow (Akinsulire, 2003).\nEffective cash management is the fundamental standing point to ensure that the firm’s finances", "word_count": 395, "start_char": 16169, "end_char": 18602}

Managing cash is a real challenge to financial managers in Uganda; most\ncompanies obtain cash from inappropriate sources which creates problems in cash management\ntherefore bringing mismatch in investments decisions. The goals of the cash management\nfunction brings out the basic responsibility of the cash manager which broadly speaking takes up\nplanning, monitoring and controlling of cash flows and the cash position of a company, while\nmaintaining its liquidity (Coyle, 2010). Accordingly, (Festus, 2011) observed that poor\nmanagement practices constraints business operations and some customers who are not satisfied\nwith the services ran away signifying poor performance and hence retards the business growth.\nThe problem arises in trying to encourage managers to spend money wisely as opposed to\ninvesting in projects with a lower required rate of return or wasting the said funds in\norganizational inefficiencies (Wang, 2010).When a company is holding cash or cash equivalents\nthat are insufficient, interruptions of normal flow of most business operations occurs. A large\nnumber of business entities were experiencing negative cash flows in their operations which\ncaused difficulties in meeting company liabilities such as payment of suppliers, staff wages and\nsalaries and meeting deadlines for tax payments Kaketo, Timbirimu, Kiizah & Olutayo, (2017).\nHowever inadequate cash management has led to slow rate in making orders, delivery of services\ntimely due to delayed payment of suppliers. These inadequate or improper cash management\nprocedures were some of the major challenges.\n1.3 General objective\nThe intention of the investigation is to examine the role of cash flow management on the\nfinancial performance of small and medium Enterprises.\n1.4 Specific objectives\nTo assess the importance of cash flow management for the overall performance and success of\nsmall and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).\nTo examine the relationship between effective cash flow management practices and the\nfinancial stability of SMEs.\nTo identify the key factors influencing cash flow management in SMEs and their impact on\nbusiness performance.", "word_count": 357, "start_char": 18376, "end_char": 20772}

In\naddition, the researcher will discuss empirical studies done by previous researchers.\n2.1 Theoretical Framework\nCash management theory\nThe cash management theory developed by James Mao and Charlie Sarndral (1978) focuses on\nliquidity. By covering cash losses or using its surplus, cash management entails controlling cash\ninflows, cash outflows, and balances at certain times (Kipruto, 2013). Aziz and Dar (2006) claim\nthat it is challenging to anticipate cash flow since there are periods when it exceeds inflows and\nother times when it does not, and there is thus a key interest in short-term management of the\ncompany. Unbalanced income and cost may be the cause of poor cash management (Pandey,\n2005). According to Kibuchi (2018), reduced financial burden is a result of effective cash\nmanagement. Consistent cash flow imbalances that lead to corporate failure might be the cause\nof financial crises in organizations (Aziz & Dar, 2006). The theory give reason for retaining cash\nbalance from operations to be used for investing, thus it addresses the cash flow management\nfrom operating activities variable.\nAgency Cost Theory\nJensen and Meckling founded the named theory in 1976. The model provides the association\nbetween the principals who are mainly the shareholders and agents who are mainly the company\nexecutives and managers (Sayari & Mugan, 2013). Agency cost theory holds that shareholders\nexpect the agents to act and make decisions in the principal’s best interest. However, this is not\nalways the case as the managers of organizations can be self-interested (Sharma, 2011). The\nmodel looks into the conflict affecting the shareholders and their managers - agents (Khanji &\nSiam, 2015). This model was useful to the current study as the responsibility of running the\nnamed Kenya companies is bestowed on managers who are expected to make decisions that", "word_count": 350, "start_char": 22245, "end_char": 24495}
{"chunk_id": "DOC0008__00009", "doc_id": "DOC0008", "chunk_index": 9, "text": "he\nmodel looks into the conflict affecting the shareholders and their managers - agents (Khanji &\nSiam, 2015).T\n\nhis model was useful to the current study as the responsibility of running the\nnamed Kenya companies is bestowed on managers who are expected to make decisions that\n\nfavor the shareholders with ensuring a stable cash flow position and sound financial performance\nbeing a good indication of the managers’ execution of this responsibility.\nThe Modigliani and Miller Theory\nThis theory was a continuation of Modigliani and Miller work in 1961 after a paper titled:\nDividend Policy, Growth, and the Valuation of Shares were published by the two in the Journal\nof Business (Mirosky & Debrah, 2014). They provided a new concept when it came to the use of\ndividends as an important measure of an organization’s value. Based on various assumptions\ntheir argument was that investors should not make investment decisions based on whether a\ncompany gives divided or not (Smith & Barclay, 2015). According to this model in the investors\nview dividends and capital gains are the same. A company’s value is thus pegged on the earnings\nthat it gets that are determined by how lucrative the industry is and the investment decision the\nfirm makes (Stiglitz, 2010). If the investors can access the organization’s investment policy then\nthey can successfully opt to invest in the firm or not based on this information (Brusov, Filatova,\nOrehova, Brusov & Brusova, 2011). This model was relevant to the current study given that the\ninvestment policy of a firm has significant implications on its cash inflows and outflows as well\nas on the earning power of the firm. As such, when evaluating the cash flow position of a firm,\nactivities in its investment section cannot be ignored.\nPecking Order Theory\nPecking order theory is also referred to as the information asymmetry theory. Donaldson is the\ndeveloper of the theory in 1961 and later it was modified by Stewart Myers and Nicolas Majluf\nin 1984 (Al-Najjar, 2013). The theory states companies will always prefer to finance their\noperations by use of internal financing rather than from equity and will only go for equity\nfinancing if they are out of options. Thus, a firm will first use its internal finances and once these\nare depleted the firm will opt for debt financing and equity financing as the last resort (Frank &\nGoyal, 2013). Based on this theory, firms prefer to finance their investments, first internally with\nretained earnings, then with debt and finally with the issue of new equity (Harford et al., 2012).\nThe choice to use internal funds to fund investments is based on the assumption that they have\nno transaction costs while the use of debt is preferred to stock given that it signals positive\ninformation regarding the firm’s ability to repay both the borrowed funds and accruing interest\n(Smith & Barclay, 2015). This model will be significant to this study since managers are", "word_count": 490, "start_char": 24218, "end_char": 27163}
{"chunk_id": "DOC0008__00010", "doc_id": "DOC0008", "chunk_index": 10, "text": "his model will be significant to this study since managers are\n\nexpected to make wise decisions that distinguish between the conservative and aggressive\nfinancing strategies to optimize a firm’s performance (Omag, 2016). This theory was relevant to\nthe current study given that internal financing (though ploughed back earnings) and external\nfinancing (through issue of shares or debt instruments) form the major sources of corporates’\nfinancing and where a firm’s internal funds are depleted, use of debt instruments and issue of\nequity provide the mechanisms through which the firm can raise much needed cash inflows for\nits continued operation.\nMiller-Orr Model of Cash Management\nThe Miller-Orr model of cash management is one of the prominent cash management models\ndeveloped by M.H Miller and Daniel Orr in 1966. This stochastic cash management model helps\nthe present day business enterprises to manage their cash while taking into consideration the\nfluctuations in daily cash flow. This model deals with cash inflows/outflows that change on a\ndaily basis (Drake & Fabozzi, 2010). The model specifies two control limits, the upper control\nlimit (beyond which the cash balance should not be carried) and the lower control limit (to which\nthe firm should maintain cash resources at least to the extent of the lower limit), and a target cash\nbalance (which is the return point for the firm’s cash balances or the desired level of the cash\nbalances) (Nagano et al., 2015). This theory was relevant to the current study given its focus on\ncash flow management\nCash flow management in SMEs\nCash flow management is the nucleus of a business entity for short and long-term survival\n(Munusamy, 2010); concerned with both the short term and long- term financial objectives\n(Evans, 2012); and determined by examining the cash flow statement (Statt and Truman, 2003).\nAccording to Aminu, (2012) cash flow management brings together actions concerned with cash\npayment, collection management and liquidity management, which involves acquisition and\ndisposal of treasury assets and their subsequent monitoring, a strategy for investing surpluses of\ncash for maximum profitability and financing deficits at minimum costs.\nAccording to Percat, (2012) around 90% of SMEs failures in Saudi Arabia are due to inadequate\nmanagement cash flow). Muller (2008) noted that in order for SMEs to manage their cash flow,\nthey must understand cash flow and be able to project how and when cash will be received and\nspent, take steps to optimize revenue and expenditure timing and amounts.

Most of the studies carried out\nbefore focused on the relationship between investing, financing and operating activities in terms\nof organizational performance. However, it is quite evident that cash flow in a way or other\naffects an entities’ profitability though there is not enough evidence to support. According to\n(Miles, 2010) cash flow management activities have to be a result of investment, financing,\noperating, equity investment, cash collection, plant investment and or debt repayments. This\nstudy will focus on small and medium sized enterprises by looking at the cash flow management\nfrom investing, operating as well as financing activities.\nEfficiency in performances of small and medium sized enterprises and their weaknesses are\nsometimes a result of failure and lagging of their respective cash flows management\nidentifications. Cash flow management is mainly born out the process of cash accumulation,\ngeneral business transaction and other events. Cash flow remains the principle of the financial\nperformance of any organization and the circular manifestation as the aim of law that has to be\ndecided by the shareholders. This implies that cash flow management will always be the core of\nfinancial performance (Mong’o, 2010).\nThere are various ways of determining measure of financial performance of small and medium\nsized enterprises. Athanase (2015) indicated that the measure of financial performance has been\nmade by applying possible indicators in most businesses by evaluating returns on asset and\nreturns on equity as the appetite of shareholders. The entity’s financial performance can also be\nmeasured by applying financial ratios depending on the actual environment and the targeted aim\nbeing the most common measures in relation to accounting. These measures include net profit,\nreturn on asset, return on equity, current ratio, liquid ratio and credit ratios (Dukes, Davis and\nDyckman, 1998; Gullet and Hicks, 1981 and Nwanyanwu, 2013a).

Therefore, this study will take this dimension to\nresearch and evaluate the association and interdependence of variables.\nThe assumption of this research is grounded stability of monies coming in to any organization\nand that it is an indicator to the opportunity for financial presence and profitability. The\nperformance of an entity can also be determined by the use of return on equity (ROE) and return\non assets (ROA). Cash flow and profits of an organization are much related. A sound cash flow\nstanding is reflected in the cash levels of an organization. When an entry continues in trend of\nmaking profits, then it is assumed that has stable cash flow hence has enough cash for investment\ndecisions. It is evident that profit, in turn is always a reflection of the image in its cash flow\nsoundness or bottom line of cash flow statement (Panigrahi, 2013).\nCash management and financial performance\nNdirangu (2017) conducted a study on the effect of cash management and performance of\ncompanies. Company size was found to have a negative and insignificant effect on financial\nperformance. Focusing on manufacturing companies in Nigeria, (Abioro, 2013) established that a\nmere availability of cash (liquidity) without proper management does not necessarily translate\ninto favorable financial performance. A related study conducted in manufacturing firms in\nSrilanka found an insignificant relationship between cash ratio and financial performance and\ncash turnover ratio and financial performance (Janaki, 2016).(Yousef, 2016) also found that 67%\nof SMEs in Jordan had no knowledge about cash control procedures. The above studies generally\nsuggest that cash management may not contribute to financial performance. However, this seems\nto be true in relation to the level of growth of the company. The situation is likely to change as\nbusinesses grow. For example, cash holding practices and use of technology in cash management\nhave a relevant effect on financial performance of SMEs in Nyeri, Kenya (Kinyanjui, Kiragu, &\nKamau, 2017). In Mogadishu, cash management was found to have a high effect on financial\nperformance of private secondary schools (Mohamed & Omar, 2016). Similarly, (Murkor,\nMuturi, & Oluoch, 2018) found that operating cash flow management had significant and\npositive effect on return on assets and insignificant and positive effect on return on equity. The\nfocus of this study were the mutual funds in Kenya.", "word_count": 437, "start_char": 31862, "end_char": 34654}

It would minimize the positive items and\nmaximize the negative items affecting the cash cycle, leading to a minimum number of days in\na cash cycle. Menon, (2011) added that cash flow management helps SMEs in spotting\npotential cash flow gaps, serves as a reference tool for seeking funds from bankers, and\nenhances confidence of the bankers on the SMEs effectiveness. Amuzu (2010) agreed that cash\nflow is an important measurement used by investors for evaluating a company because it\nfocuses on actual operation and eliminates one- time expenses and non-cash charges and gives a\nclear picture of what the company is truly doing. Correia C et al, (2007) also observed that cash\nflow is an area looked upon with great interest by financial and economic analysts as a credible\nindicator on the strength, or riskiness, of an enterprise as it gives an enterprise the possibility of\neither cutting or stripping off some operations, or ceasing altogether. Lange (2010) asserts that\nSME can still have an image of profitability and still be in danger of running into bankruptcy\nbecause many people think of the profits that the business will generate rather than planning on\nmanaging cash flows. Lange further explained that many profitable SMEs face serious\noperational challenges as their liquid assets and cash are all tied to assets, thus lacking the\nneeded cash to settle financial obligations.\nMinnery (2006) maintains that an efficient cash flow management system plays a key role and\nhelps to demonstrate that the SME is profitable. Minnery explained that an enterprise will need\nto generate a profit over a long-term period but if it does not generate sufficient cash reserves\nfor its daily operations and for the generation of a profit for the owners, then such enterprise is a\nfailure. Minnery observed further that while the overriding logic in the creation and\nestablishment of any business concern is the generation of a profit for the business it is still the\namount of cash that is recognized as the crucial resource in the short, medium, and long-term\nlife of any business.", "word_count": 424, "start_char": 34398, "end_char": 36996}

Scholars have extensively researched\nand highlighted the relationship between cash flow management and the financial well-being of\nSMEs. Here are some perspectives from different scholars:\nLazaridis and Tryfonidis (2006): Lazaridis and Tryfonidis emphasize the importance of cash\nflow forecasting, monitoring, and control in SMEs. They argue that accurate cash flow\nprojections help SMEs anticipate and address potential cash shortages, enabling them to make\ninformed decisions and ensure financial stability.\nTaffler and Tisshaw (2011)Taffler and Tisshaw suggest that SMEs should adopt efficient\nworking capital management practices to maintain a healthy cash flow. They emphasize the\nneed for SMEs to carefully manage their receivables, payables, and inventory to optimize cash\nflow and enhance financial stability.\nDeloof (2003): Deloof investigates the impact of working capital management on the financial\nperformance of SMEs. His research reveals that effective management of cash conversion cycle\ncomponents, such as accounts receivable, accounts payable, and inventory, positively influences\nthe liquidity and financial stability of SMEs.\nChapra and Sufian (2012): Chapra and Sufian examine the role of financial management\npractices in SMEs' financial stability. They argue that SMEs should adopt prudent financial\nmanagement techniques, including cash flow management, to enhance their resilience to\nfinancial shocks and ensure long-term stability.\nVintilă and Gherghina (2015): Vintilă and Gherghina analyze the determinants of SMEs'\nfinancial stability and find that effective cash flow management is a critical factor. They suggest\nthat SMEs should actively monitor their cash inflows and outflows, maintain sufficient liquidity\nreserves, and seek external financing options when necessary to ensure financial stability.\nBerger and Udell (2006): Berger and Udell examine the relationship between small business\nfinancing and financial stability.

The goals were to determine the impact of retained profits on\nprofitability, the impact of liabilities on profitability of the company, and the impact of dividend\npolicy on profitability. To examine the relationship between these two factors, the study\nemployed correlations analysis. The research looked at 19 publicly traded firms in the United\nStates and three different performance metrics, including market performance (based on changes\nin stock market value), profitability (return on investment), and cash flow performance\n(dividend-per-share). Companies with lesser total assets, greater liabilities, lower equity, an\nunbiased auditor's judgment, and lower retained earnings, according to the study's findings,\nperform better in terms of cash flow (as determined by cash dividend). It is advised that\nbusinesses have effective operating cash flow management; as a result, regression analysis was\nemployed in this study. As a result, there were conceptual and contextual gaps, which the current\nstudy aims to solve by taking into account cash from operations, net cash-flow from workingcapital adjustments, and noncash elements in the Kenyan manufacturing industry. Additionally,\npanel regression analysis was used in the study.\n\nNwanyanwu (2015) looked at how operating cash-flow activities affect an organizational\nperformance in the Nigeria's tourism sector. The goals were to study how operational cash flows\naffected an organization's performance, to ascertain how processing loans affected that\nperformance, and to discover how equity investments affected that performance. There were 45\nhotels and print media companies in the sample. Inferential statistics utilizing correlations\nanalysis were employed in the investigation. The investigation came to the conclusion that taxes\nand cash payments to suppliers had an impact on cash flow statement performance. In this\nresearch, operating cash flow activities were examined using manufacturing enterprises.\nConsequently, there were conceptual and subjective gaps that the current study attempted to\n\nclose by include operating cash flow, net cash-flow from adjustments to operating capital, and\nnoncash elements in Kenya's industrial sector.", "word_count": 401, "start_char": 41307, "end_char": 44172}

The objectives were to ascertain the impact\nof investing cash flow on success, the impact of current assets on profitability, and the impact of\ncurrent liabilities on profitability for the company. 23 businesses made up the sample size.\nDescriptive statistics were utilized in the investigation. Because they directly affect both liquidity\nand profitability, the findings have significant implications for businesses. Current assets and\ncurrent liabilities of the company are included in the cash flow from investments. The study\nfound that profitability is impacted by net investment cash flows.

A sample of 8\nbusinesses listed on the London Stock Exchange was utilized in the study. The data utilized for\nanalysis came from the released financial statements of the 8 corporations. The association\nbetween financing cash flows and company performance was determined using component\nanalysis. According to the study, there is a substantial relationship amongst corporate success of\nLondon-listed corporations and investing cash flows.

The purpose of the study was to establish the impact of\ncash flow management on the financial performance of small and medium sized enterprises.\nSpecifically this chapter addresses itself to resolving the research objectives which include; to\nassess the importance of cash flow management for the overall performance and success of\nsmall and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), to examine the relationship between effective\ncash flow management practices and the financial stability of SMEs, to identify the key\nfactors influencing cash flow management in SMEs and their impact on business performance.\n4.2 KEY FINDINGS\nThe study was set to find out the impact of cash flow management on the financial\nperformance of small and medium sized enterprises.\nThe gender composition in this study indicates that 65.7% were female while only 34.3% were\nmale. The high composition of women in the study stems from the nature of businesses\ninvestigated i.e. merchandize and service businesses. In line with age, 33.3% belonged to 31 – 40\nyears of age and were the majority, followed 31.4% who belonged to 21 – 29 years of age,\nfollowed by 25.5% who had 50 and above years while 9.8% belonged to 41 – 50 years and were\nthe least. This actually, implies that the businesses investigated were run mostly by women.\nAccording to marital status, 68.6% were married and were the majority while 29.4% were single.\nThe statistics suggest that majority of the businesses investigated were run by women, who had\nfamilial roles in addition to their businesses. About 33.3% had secondary education and were the\nmajority, followed by 32.4% who had tertiary education followed by 22.5% who had primary\neducation while only 11.8% had university degrees.

This is further proved by the (regression sum of squares =.387) which is smaller\nthan the (residual sum of squares = 11.219). This further emphasizes the fact that cash flow\nmanagement is not significant in accounting for the level of variation in financial management.\nThe suggested model is: Financial performance = 4.417 – 0.183(cash flow management) + ε,\nwhere ε is the possible error estimate in the model. The model reflects a decrease in financial\nperformance associated to cash flow management because most of the measures of cash flow\nmanagement used were focusing on competence in cash flow management.\nThe study was about cash flow management and financial performance among selected small and\nmedium enterprises. The study found a weak relationship between cash flow management and\nfinancial performance. The findings disagree with Robert & Hamacher, (2015) who investigated\nthe effect of cash flow management on financial performance of mutual funds and noted that\ncash flows positively affected financial performance. Similarly, the findings disagree with\nTurcas, (2011) who noted that solvency, flexibility and financial performance of a firm are set on\nthe firm’s ability to generate cash flows from operating, investing and financial activities. In the\nsame view, Waswa, Mukras & Oima, (2018) observed that careful consideration and planning of\nfunding liquidity management is one of the ways to measure financial performance and therefore\nfirms should increase their operating cash flow to positively influence their performance. Study\nfindings revealed that business owners find it easy managing cash receivable from customers,\nholding inventories, generating sufficient cash for meeting immediate obligations and have learnt\nto maintain liquidity positions. The statistics support Kroes & Subramantam, (2012) who noted\nthat a firm cash flow management policy, which manages working capital in form of cash\nreceivables from customers, inventory holding and cash to suppliers is widely linked to improved\nfinancial performance. Business owners revealed that they are unable to forecast receipts and\npayments, have not learnt matching timing of payment against cash available, makes it difficult\nto maintain large cash reserves and sustainable cash flow. The results disagree with Njeru, Njeru,\nMember &Tirimba, (2015) who pointed out that cash flow management would focus on building\nsustainable cash flow and forecasting receipts and payments so as to manage day-to-day\noperations of the business.

The study was based on SMES in Jordan.\nBusiness owners revealed doing their best to avoid exposure to financial risks, improving cash\nflow, maintaining stable financial positions to avoid running into bankruptcy.

Cash flow management was measured\nby the three variables which included investing activities, operating activities and financing\nactivities and the financial performance of SMEs. The study employed the secondary data which\nwas obtained from the financial statements of the companies. Data analysis involved descriptive\ndata analysis and the regression analysis.\nThe descriptive analysis was aimed at establishing the impact of the cash flow management on\nfinancial performance of SMES.\nThe study also employed regression analysis. From the regression analysis results, the\nregression model accounted for 20.5% of the variance in performance. This is evident from the\nadjusted R2 value of 0.206 and the F-Statistic was 5.43 and this was significant at 5%\nsignificance level this implies that the model employed was fit. From the findings of the study,\nthe effects of cash flow management were found to be insignificant at 5% level of significance.\nHowever the effect on financial performance was found to be statistically significant at 5% level\nof significance.\n5.3 Conclusion\nThe study aimed at establishing the effect of cash flow management on the financial\nperformance of companies listed of Small and medium sized enterprises. From the study\nfindings, the cash flow management had a positive but insignificant effect on the financial\nperformance. This implies that cash flow management has no any influence on the financial\nperformance. From the findings of the study it was also established that the size of the company\nhad a negative and insignificant effect on the financial performance. It implies that the size of\nthe company has no any influence on the financial performance.", "word_count": 384, "start_char": 70635, "end_char": 73169}

This will\nincrease the cash management cycle which will in turn improve the financial performance of the\ncompanies in small and medium sized enterprises.\n5.5 Areas for Further Research\nThis study employed only the secondary data in the analysis. Another study should be\nundertaken to incorporate both secondary data and primary data since primary data is able to\nbring out some aspects which are not dealt by the secondary data. It could be the change in\nfinancial performance is not brought about by cash management alone.\nIn this study, all the segments of Small Scale Businesses were represented since two companies\nwere taken from each segment. A similar study should be conducted considering each segment\nas a separate entity.\n\nREFFERENCES\n\n[1.] Abioro, M. (2013).
