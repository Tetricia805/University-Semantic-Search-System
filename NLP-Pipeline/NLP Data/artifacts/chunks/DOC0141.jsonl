For instance, during the 1955 India-\nPakistan test series, an estimated 20,000 Indians were given permission to attend the\nthird test in Lahore creating what one newspaper described as the biggest mass\nmigration across the frontier since partition2.\nSports is defined to mean all forms of physical activity which through casual or\norganized participation, aims at expressing or improving physical fitness and mental\nwellbeing, forming social relationships or obtaining results in competition at all levels3.\nThis is traditionally and generally most accepted definition especially when deciding\nwhether a particular activity claiming to be sport usually for funding purposes4.\nThe purpose of the proposal is to outline a comprehensive examination on the\ninfluence of the legal framework on sports performance in Uganda, with the growing\ninterest and investment in sports across the nation, it’s important to access the role of\nthe legal structures in shaping the landscape of sports and its overall performance.\n1.2 Background\nUganda boosts of a rich sporting tradition, consistently producing talented athletes\nacross different sporting fields ranging from athletics, basketball, netball, cricket,\nboxing to football and many more sports beyond the above-mentioned sports and this\nhas contributed significantly to its cultural, social and economic fabric.

Furthermore Houlihan also puts emphasis on the\ncommercialization of sport and provides that a clear legal framework around\nintellectual property, broadcasting rights and athlete endorsement and sponsorships\nand this therefore can foster the development and promotion of sport sector. The\nauthor is on the view that the legal frame work and different policies should be able to\nensure standardized training and ensure proper coach qualifications but however the\nto attain these standardized training and proper coaching qualifications there is need\nto purchase the equipment and these equipment are too expensive and cannot be\npurchased by countries in the third world class.\nSeveral nations have demonstrated the positive impact of a well-designed legal\nframework and through this some sports activities have expanded in the different\ncountries. According to Horne and Wann12, Germany’s success in football is partly\nattributed to its robust youth development system supported by a clear legal structure\nin country of Germany. And furthermore Malcolm13 shows that Australia’s anti-doping\nlegislation is considered a model for fair competition, contributing to the country’s\nstrong showing in various sports.

There are various forms of sport in the world and these\ninclude; rugby, football, tennis, boat rowing, basketball, hockey, cricket, swimming,\nboxing and table tennis and these sports can be understood by the way they are\nplayed or the activity involved in them14 and through these forms of different sport,\ndifferent laws have been setup so as to ensure the development of the sport and fair\ncompetition in the sport.\nAccording to Andrew,15 the history of sports law can be followed back from the\nbeginning or origin of sport in the world and furthermore stated that the law in sport\nwas majorly used in the organized sport competitions and he provided that these\norganized competitions can be traced back at the ancient Egyptians as early as 1829\nB.C and also the athlete competitions that took place in Ireland. He further stated that\nthe interaction of the sport and law was majorly involved where there was violation of\nthe rules of the game and stated that the Olympic Games were majorly setup to\npromote peace between Greek city states and strict rules to govern the games were\npassed and they were enforced by judges.\n\n14 https://www.legal500.com/developments/thought-leadership/sports-law-evolution-anintroduction-by-ll-vol-1/.\n15 Andrew T.

Furthermore, some of these\nevents served as a way of eliminating some criminals or unwanted people in the\nsociety, he further goes ahead and states that some conservative Romans regulated\nsport since many romans believed that the Greek athletics were a corrupting influence\non Roman youth, he further provides an example the law required the Roman athletes\nto wear clothing’s during competition unlike the practice of nudity among Greek\nathletes16.\nTraditionally, problems arising from a sporting event were solved by way of the\ncustomary practices of society. Sports Law fundamentally was not recognized in its\npresence in society and is generally managed by nonprofit bodies. Sports and law\nwere often considered different realms. Many believed that it is a mere amalgamation\nof various areas of civil law such as Contract law, Labour Law, Tax Law, Anti-doping\nLaw, and Intellectual Property Law. Sports Law was nothing more than the general\nlaw applied to the sportsperson or body17.\nOver the years, the growth in the sports industry has been exponential but\nwithout a strong legal framework. Sports and the law work hand in hand so to ensure\nthe proper development of sport. Since sports deals with many aspects there different\nissues of law that come into considerations and these include, contract law as this\nmajorly deals with contracts, intellectual property law this brings out the aspect of\nimage rights and therefore sports persons able to handle their rights in sports and\ndiscourages exploitations, human rights is also one that the sportsmen can engage\nwith as this helps to protect their human rights and discourage any violation of their\nhuman rights18.\n2.3 Conclusion.\nIn conclusion, the chapter majorly discusses the history of the legal framework of sport\naround the world, and we have been able to find out that sport has been in existence\n\n16 Ibid.\n17 https://www.legal500.com/developments/thought-leadership/sports-law-evolution-anintroduction-by-ll-vol-1/.\n18 https://www.legal500.com/development/thought-leadership/sport-law-legalframework-by-II-vol-\n2/\n\nfor a long period of time and that furthermore even in the ancient times there still\nexcited laws that govern the way sports we played and this ensured the growth of sport\nin the ancient times.\nThe next chapter which is chapter three majorly refers to the legal of the study in the\nresearch and enable us look at the study in a legal way to see if the legal frame has\nan impact on the development of sport in the country.", "word_count": 448, "start_char": 24775, "end_char": 27598}

According to James\nand Li Wei19 they state that the enactment of China’s sports law provides an\nopportunity to gain fresh perspective developments not only in China itself but the\nglobal arena. Therefore through this we see that sports law is able to promote proper\ndevelopments of the sports sector and being able to create competition on the\ninternational stage and challenge for the different awards in the sporting competitions.\nIn order to ensure the development of sport, this chapter is going to give an overview\nof the legal frame work of sports in Uganda and how the legal frame work has been\nable to promote sport in the country.\n3.2 Legal framework of sports\n3.2.1 The 1995 Constitution of the Republic of Uganda\nIn Uganda the supreme law of the land is the 1995 constitution of the Republic of\nUganda as amended and it’s binding on all people and authority on the land.\nTherefore, the constitution is the law that governs the land and all the laws formed\nmust conform to it as provided for under Article 220. The 1995 constitution provides\nfor sport under Objective XVII and provides for recreation and sport and furthermore,\nstates that the state shall promote recreation and sports for the citizens in Uganda.\nFurthermore, the constitution under Article 8A (1)21 provides that Uganda shall\nbe governed based on principles of national interest and common good enshrined in\nthe national objectives and directive principles and under article 8A (2) provides that\n\n19 James A.R.

Therefore, Article 8A (2) gives the parliament powers to make laws so as\nto put into force the different objectives that are provided for in the 1995 constitution\nas amended. Furthermore the 1995 constitution of Uganda as amended has different\nprovisions with in the constitution that can be used to regulate the sport sector in the\ncountry and these include different articles as provided for below;\nArticle 2122 provides for equality and freedom from discrimination, and\nfurthermore states that all persons are equal before and under the law in all spheres\nof political, economic, social and cultural life in every other respect and shall enjoy\nequal protection of the law, Article 21(2) provides that a person shall not be\ndiscriminated against on the ground of sex, race, color, ethnic origin, tribe, creed or\nreligion, social or economic standing, political opinion or disability. The constitution\nunder Article 21(3) goes further ahead to define discriminate to mean to give different\ntreatment to different persons attributable only or mainly to their respective\ndescriptions by sex, race, color, ethnic origin, tribe, birth, creed or religion, social\neconomic standing, political opinion or disability. Since the constitution is the supreme\nlaw in the country this article under the constitution falls under the sports sector and\ntherefore it discourages discrimination in sport and every person is free to engage in\nsport and no one is to discriminate people basing on sex, race, color, ethnic origin,\ntribe, birth or any other aspect which may lay grounds for discrimination.\nIn the case of Christopher Martin Madrama Izama v Attorney General23 the\ncourt stated that for any of the above elements to amount to discrimination, it must\nhave been done outside the law and with negative intentions. Therefore the court\nstates that for one claim discrimination it must have been done under the elements\nstated in under article 21(2) of the constitution and it shouldn’t be in line with law and\nit must have negative intentions towards the victim who has been discriminated.\nArticle 21 of the 1995 constitution as amended majorly prohibits discrimination\non basis of race, sex, color, ethnic origin, tribe, birth, creed or religion therefore even", "word_count": 434, "start_char": 29326, "end_char": 32045}

The primary objective was to\nexamine on the impact of the sports legal framework on the performance of sports in\nUganda.\n4.2 Summary of findings\nThe study reveals that the sports sector is one of the most growing sectors globally\nand its one that’s increasing and improving the livelihood of different people in the\ncommunity, through this the sports sector requires laws that are to be able to regulate\nand govern sport in the country and other places of the world.\nThe study revealed that the legal framework in Uganda still has very many\nloopholes in regards to the promotion of sport in the country as the legal framework\nhas left out many different fields that are able to promote sport in the country, the legal\nframework doesn’t address the E-sport as its one the ventures that’s completely\ngrowing in the sport world.\nThe study revealed that the legal framework ousts the jurisdiction of court in\nsports disputes and this therefore violates the rule of law as no one is able to check\nsport institutions in case of disputes and furthermore this also defeats justice and\nfurther more violating article 126 of the 1995 constitution of Uganda as amended.\nThe study shows that doping is one of the regulated sectors in the sports\nfraternity and this is majorly due to the high rates of the violation of the anti-doping\nrules that are provided for in the code. Through this the a body has been setup to\nregulate doping worldwide and its referred to as WADA, also at regional level there is\nestablishment of an organisation that has been established so as to regulate doping\nat regional level and this referred to as RADO and furthermore at National level one\nhas been established to regulate doping at country level and these are referred to as\nNADOs.", "word_count": 371, "start_char": 62944, "end_char": 65144}
