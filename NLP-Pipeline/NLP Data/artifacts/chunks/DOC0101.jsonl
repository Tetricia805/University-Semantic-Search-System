The\nresearch was guided by three objectives namely, to establish the effect of control environment on\nservice delivery, to assess the effect of risk assessment on service delivery and to examine the\neffect of control activities on service delivery. The research adopted a descriptive cross-sectional\nstudy design with a quantitative method to carry out the investigation. The findings of the study\nshowed that most of respondent agree that the control environment has an effect on service\ndelivery in the hotel industry. In the same they generally agree that also risk assessment has a\ntremendous effect on service delivery, and it was also ascertained that most respondents agree\nthat control activities also have huge effect on service delivery in the hotel industry. The findings\nfurther confirmed that there was a moderately strong relationship between the factors of Internal\nControl systems and the level of service delivered in the hotel industry.\nIn conclusion, it can be asserted that Internal control system comprising of the control\nenvironment and control procedures need to be adopted by all directors and management of\nhotels so as to achieve its objectives by ensuring practical, orderly and efficient conduct of the\norganization.\nIt was recommended that the hotel owners needed to adopt the highest level of asset monitoring\nsoftware to help it curb fraud coming as a result of misappropriated hotel assets and finances,\nthat hotel supervisors be given adequately high payment and a strict code of conduct so that they\ndo continuous monitoring and evaluation aimed at keeping a very high standard of operation at\nthe hotel, that security systems and all necessary apparatus needed to be upgraded, through\nadopting things like online surveillance cameras, drones, and screening of all bags and likely\nareas of bleaching internal control procedures. Similarly it was also recommended that best\ncustomers be awarded tokens of appreciation on a yearly basis like trips abroad, television sets,\nphones so that customer’s level of satisfaction is increased.\nThe areas of further study included; the need to research on the effect of credit accessibility on\ncapitalization of Small and Medium Enterprises, to examine the relationship between\nmaintaining an effective supply chain on the profitability of a company, and also to research on\nthe role of an effective organizational structure on the performance of an organization.\n\n1 | P a g e\n\nCHAPTER ONE", "word_count": 420, "start_char": 12883, "end_char": 15535}

In the broader concept, this entirely involves the entire\nprocess of controlling risks in an organization.\nThe study was guided by Stewardship Theory and Agency Theory. It actually plays a very\ncritical role in understanding the entire dynamics that govern institutional behavior at all times. It\nemphasizes primarily in the analysis of the co-existence reasons of the non-economic but trust\nbased relationships in organizations which could arise from the principal agent interest (Corbetta\n& Salvato, 2004). The stewardship approach encompasses the belief and the commitment to\nsome set of ideals that are displayed both by the principal and the agent (Albanese, Dacin &\nHarris, 1997). In as much as the stewardship attitude among the actors of the organization\ncompensates for the inadequacies realized in the Agency theory, it is faced with its own\nchallenges when it is actually applied to some business context organizations. Ramachandran\n(2007) argues that in a family of controlled business, both the Agency and the Stewardship\ntheory interplays a familial context. These theories determine the correct combination between\nthe agency and stewardship theories from different perspectives of institutional growth.\nOrganizations should respond to the system which is controlled so as to provide the rationale for\nthe possible conflict that can develop between the principal (shareholders) and the agent\n(management). Taita-Taveta National Treasury board of directors as stewards of the company\nmust ensure the long-term viability of the company by making the organization realize it\nobjectives (Coombs & Gilley, 2005) and harmonizing the interests of the organization with those\nof the interest groups.\n\n2 | P a g e", "word_count": 349, "start_char": 15535, "end_char": 17858}

In their view, the reasons to have internal controls\nis to promote operational effectiveness and efficiency, provide reliable financial and\nadministrative information, safeguard assets and records, encourage adherence to prescribed\npolicies and compliance with regulatory agencies.\nGlobally, Internal control is a key component of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) of\n1977 and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which required upgrades in inward control in United\nStates open companies Meaghan and Nick, (2012).\nIn Africa, (Adeoye M and Adeoy, 2014) “Internal control system is a topical issue following\nglobal fraudulent financial reporting and accounting scandals in both developed and developing\ncountries”. For any organization to maximize its finances and safeguard its assets, it must be able\nto manage its business processes which are one reason why ICs are very crucial. The subject of\ninternal controls is not new but then there have been series of fraudulent practices both in the\npast and in recent times.\n\n1.2 Statement of the Problem\nThe hospitality industry has a long colorful history beginning with inns, and lodges, and growing\ninto the hospitality industry as stated by Michael and Richard (2016). An incredible change in\nthe industry of tourism in the world brought many changes in the field of hotel business. This\nmeans, the expansion and development of travel has contributed a lot for the development of\nhotel industry. On the contrary, businesses in Source of the Nile Hotel Uganda couldn’t achieve\ntheir objective due to the fact their internal control systems are weak. These internal control\nproblem are more obvious in particular business sectors, such as the hotels business from the\nhospitality industry, which is one of the most growing sectors worldwide as mentioned by Politis\net al. Further, globalization of economy, technological advancements, complexity of business,\nbusinesses failures and allegations of fraudulent financial reporting have recently sharpened the\never-increasing attention to internal controls Karagiorgos et al.

It’s therefore upon this background that the research\nintends to investigate the effect of the internal control systems on service delivery.\n\n1.3 General Objective\nThe main objective of the study was to examine the effect of Internal Control System on Service\ndelivery in hotel industry focusing on Source of the Nile Hotel Jinja.\n\n1.4 Specific Objectives\nThe following are the specific objectives of the study;\na) To establish the effect of Control Environment on Service Delivery in the study Context.\nb) To assess the effect of Risk Assessment on Service Delivery in the study Context.\nc) To examine the effect of Control activities on Service Delivery in the study context.\n\n1.5 Research questions\na) What is the effect of control Environment on Service Delivery in the Study Context?\nb) What is the effect of Risk Assessment on Service Delivery in the Study Context?\nc) What is the effect of Control activities on Service Delivery in the study context?\n\n1.6 Scope of the study\n1.6.1 Area scope:\nThe study was carried out at Source of the Nile Hotel Jinja branch, the location has been\nconsidered because the area was convenient to the researcher when it comes to data collection.\n1.6.2 Content Scope:\nThe study covered the types of ICS together with ICS dimensions /constructs with their\ninfluences or functionality on service delivery in private organizations.\n\n4 | P a g e\n\n1.6.3 Time Scope:\nThe study used a cross sectional study.

It is conceptualized that service delivery depends on Internal\nControl Systems as means to improve. Service delivery has indicators of availability of quality\nservices, effectiveness, efficiency and achieved goals. The Internal Control System has\ndimensions of control Environment, Risk assessment and Control Activities. It is therefore\nhypothesized that a well-functioning internal control environment, positively contributes to\nenhanced service delivery by the Extraneous Variable Level of revenue, Staff turnover,\nAvailability of infrastructure and assessment. Control activities and Risk Assessment. Similarly,\nthe framework suggests that efforts to conduct risk assessment positively contribute to enhanced\nservice delivery by the organization. Moreover, it is conceptualized that a well-functioning\ninternal control monitoring system positively contributes to enhanced service delivery by the\nhotel. On the converse, weak internal control environment, risk assessment, and monitoring\nconstrain service delivery in the organization. Thus, any efforts to enhance service delivery should\nfocus on strengthening the internal control environment, risk assessment and monitoring.\n\nInternal Control systems:\n- Control Environment\n- Risk Assessment\n- Control Activities", "word_count": 448, "start_char": 22191, "end_char": 25237}

The first section presents the definition of key terms. The\nempirical themes are based on the study objectives of control environment, risk assessment,\nmonitoring and service delivery.\n\n2.1 Definition of key terms\nThis subsection defines the key concepts of internal control systems, its components, service\ndelivery and its associated indicators and how they are used in the study.\n\n2.1.1 Internal control\nInternal control may be defined as the whole system of controls, financial and otherwise,\nestablished by the management in order to carry on the business of the company in an orderly\nmanner, safeguard its assets and secure as far as possible the accuracy and reliability of its\nrecords. It has been observed that the concept of internal control goes beyond financial and\naccountancy matters and the custody of company assets to include controls designed to improve\noperational efficiency and ensure adherence to company policies. The board of directors should\nhave the responsibility for approving strategies and policies and ensuring that senior\nmanagement is monitoring the effectiveness of the Internal Control System (Basley, 2016).\n\nAmudo and Inanga, (2009) define Internal control system as comprising of the control\nenvironment and control procedures adopted by directors and management of an organization in\nachieving its objectives by ensuring practical, orderly and efficient conduct of an organization.\nThis may include adherence to policies, safeguarding assets, prevention and detection of fraud\naccuracy and competences of accounting records and timely preparation of financial reports.\nAccording to Cieslewicz, (2006) Internal Control is defined as all the policies and procedures\nadopted by the directors and management of an entity to assist in achieving their objective of\nensuring, as far as practicable, the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including\n\n7 | P a g e", "word_count": 394, "start_char": 24876, "end_char": 27518}
{"chunk_id": "DOC0101__00009", "doc_id": "DOC0101", "chunk_index": 9, "text": "ccording to Cieslewicz, (2006) Internal Control is defined as all the policies and procedures\nadopted by the directors and management of an entity to assist in achieving their objective of\nensuring, as far as practicable, the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including\n\n7 | P a g e\n\nadherence to internal policies, the safeguarding of assets, the prevention and detection of frauds.\nAccording to Swamy (2014), internal controls in accounting system serves the function of\nensuring that all transactions carried out are suctioned and authorized by management. This is\nimportant because all activities of the organization are performed in line with the laid down\npolicies. All transactions should be accounted for in the relevant books of accounts regularly,\nachieved. The concept of reasonable assurance recognizes that no structure is perfect and that the\ncost of the entity’s internal control should not exceed the benefits to be derived.\n\n2.1.2 Service delivery\nService Delivery According to Parasuraman et al (2015), service quality is an attitude or\njudgment concerning the excellence of a service rendered to a customer. In order for an\norganization to be competitive, it must strive to attain a level of quality in services it delivers that\nexceed the expectations of customers. The quality of service is a critical factor that determines\nthe success or failure of service organizations. As Moody (2005) states, Quality is the total\ncharacteristics of an entity that bear on its ability to satisfy stated and implied needs.\n\nQuality service implies the degree of excellence which infers to nil defect of a service or product.\nQuality of service is also customer’s perception or judgment of the inconsistency between the\nservice provided and service expected (Caruana, 2002). Players in the hospitality and other\nservice industries are striving to discovery ways enhance their delivery of service that are\nsuperior and capable of meeting customer requirements hence customer satisfaction. Apparently,\nsatisfying the needs of customers is a top priority of every hotel business organization that\nrecognizes customers as their greatest resource and reason for their survival. Within the\nhospitality industry, businesses are investing incredible effort and time to assess and enhance the\nquality of services they render to customers. This is because they understand the importances of\nquality in ensuring customers are satisfied.\n\nDelivery of quality services in a consistent manner is a sure way of the organization gaining a\ncompetitive edge. The organization requires an informed understanding of the needs and\nexpectations of its customers and the types of what the customer’s perception of quality.\nFurtherance to this, the organization should be fully aware of all factors that influence the desired\n\n8 | P a g e", "word_count": 441, "start_char": 27223, "end_char": 30057}

It is also important for the\norganization to understand that customers compare the perceived quality of services with\nexpected quality of the same service. Therefore, service organizations must make deliberate\nefforts to acquire the necessary knowledge about customer perceptions and the influence of\nfactors such as service encounter, service evidence, appearance and image of the service\norganization and more importantly the customer’s perception of the price of the service.\n\n9 | P a g e", "word_count": 143, "start_char": 29784, "end_char": 30713}

Control environment is the\nfoundation for all the other components of internal control. It comprises of factors like; integrity\nand ethical values of personnel tasked with creating, administering, and monitoring the controls,\ncommitment and competence of persons performing assigned duties, board of directors or audit\ncommittees, management philosophy and operating style, and organizational structure.\nMany factors go into control environment but this component is highly influenced by the\neffectiveness of the board of directors, the management, and the audit division of the\norganization. Internal auditors are essential to effective control environment since the\neffectiveness of these factors largely depends on their interaction with the internal and external\nauditor. Control environment sets the tone of an organization, influencing the control\nconsciousness of its people (Aldridge and Colbert, 1994). It reflects the attitude and policies of\nmanagement in regard to the importance of internal controls in revenue generation. In addition,\ncontrol environment is influenced by the history and the culture of organization and has an\ninsidious influence on the way organization activities are structured. It thus sets a positive and\nsupportive attitude toward internal control and conscientious management.\nA review of extant literature shows that a number of studies have been carried out on control\nenvironment Umar et al. (2018), investigated the effect of internal control systems on the\nperformance of commercial banks in Nigeria, a survey design was employed and 382\nrespondents selected using stratified random sampling.

A case study design was adopted, a study\npopulation consisted of 138 respondents and questionnaire, interview guide and documents\nreview methods were used to collect data, analysis was done using descriptive statistics of mean\nand standard deviation, correlation and regression analysis.\n\nThe study found a moderate positive significant relationship between internal control\nenvironment and hospitality service delivery. It sets the ambience of the enterprise through\nimpinging on the control awareness of its individuals (Whittington and Pany, 2001), and it is the\nbasis for every other internal control aspect. It embroils aspects like; truthfulness and moral\nstandards of people charged with crafting, overseeing, as well as evaluating the controls,\nassurance and proficiency of people undertaking delegated tasks, administration viewpoint and\nfunctional approach, as well as organizational structure. Several aspects discuss control\nenvironment however this aspect is greatly impinged on by the Board of Directors’ efficiency,\nthe administration, and the enterprise’s audit unit. Internal auditors are key to the success of\ncontrol environment as the efficacy of these elements is greatly subject to their relationship with\nthe internal as well as external auditor. Control environment establishes the ambience of an\nenterprise, impelling the control awareness of its entities (Aldridge and Colbert, 1994). Also, it is\ninfluenced by the enterprise’s principles and history and takes a devious bearing on the manner\nthat an enterprise’s undertakings are organized.\n\nIn explaining the tenets of control environment in an organization, Kamau (2014) shows that\ncontrol environment includes a financial and accounting system, managerial commitment to\nsystem operations, monitoring and implementation of internal control systems, and clear\nchannels of communication between supervisees and supervisors. Similarly, Josiah (2013) adds\nthat organizations with effective control environments report superior supervision of workers,\nefficient operations, complete transaction reduced risks, proper coordination of departments, and\nproper delegation. However, the benefits of internal controls as portrayed by Kamau and Josiah\nlack a contextual perspective of public health facilities.\n\n11 | P a g e", "word_count": 400, "start_char": 33232, "end_char": 36060}

It refers to the identification and analysis of relevant risks\nassociated with achieving the objectives of the organization (Karagiorgos et al., 2009). They add\nthat risk assessment is the process of identifying and analyzing management relevant risks to the\npreparation of financial statements that would be presented fairly in conformity with general\naccepted accounting principle. In organizations, management must determine the level of risk\ncarefully to be accepted, and try to maintain such risk within determined levels. It is therefore the\nmanagement’s responsibility to design internal controls to ensure efficiency and effectiveness,\nreliability of financial reporting as well as compliance with laws and regulations. This is ensured\nby periodic performance review and evaluation of the adequacy and effectiveness of the controls\ndesigned by the internal auditor department.\n\nInvestigation was carried out on the effect of internal control systems on the performance of\ncommercial banks in Nigeria Umar, D. et al (2018). A survey method was employed and the\nstudy used stratified random sampling, in which a total of 382 were chosen. They collected data\nusing questionnaire method and data was analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social\nSciences (SPSS) version 23. The findings of the study revealed a positive and significant\nrelationship between risk assessment and bank performance.\n\nMwazo et al (2017) conducted a study on the role of internal control system on service delivery\nin the National Treasury of Taita- Taveta County in Kenya. The study adopted a descriptive\nresearch design. The population of the study comprised 255 respondents, out of which a\nsample of 144 respondents was selected using stratified random sampling.\nThey collected data using the questionnaire method and analysis was performed using SPSS 21.\nThe results of the multiple regression analysis revealed a positive relationship between risk\nmanagement system and service delivery. Much as the results of this study are beneficial to the\ncurrent research, the researcher will employ a case study design where both quantitative and\nqualitative approaches will be applied.\n\n12 | P a g e", "word_count": 416, "start_char": 35670, "end_char": 38438}

(2018), a case study design was adopted, and a\npopulation sample of 138 respondents were used, a questionnaire, interview guide and\ndocuments review methods were adopted for data collection. Data was analyzed using\ndescriptive statistics of mean and standard deviation, correlation and regression analysis. The\nstudy revealed a high positive significant relationship between risk assessment and education\n\nAs stated by Menon and Williams (2010) this internal control element underlines the role of\nadministration prudently recognizing and examining aspects that could prevent it from goals\nattainment. Risk assessment is the recognition and investigation of their related risks to\nattainment of the goals, forming a ground for the manner in which risks ought to be controlled.\nAs economic, market, monitoring and operational situations will keep on changing, ways are\nnecessary to recognize and tackle the distinctive risks linked with transformation (Crerar, 2007).\nIt is similarly organized procedure for incorporating specialized decision regarding likely hostile\nsituations and happenings, and evaluating the possibility of likely financial and non-financial\ndamages attributed to their happening (Morris, 2011). The second internal control guideline\nfocuses on risk evaluation. Internal control ought to offer for the risk evaluation the organization\nencounters from internal as well as external origins. After risks have been recognized, they must\nbe inspected for their likely weight.\n\nWhile there is little research on risk assessment on service delivery in private institutions\n(Rehman, Ramzan, Hwang, & Kim, 2021), attempt to relate the two concepts. The authors used\nrisk assessment to mediate the relation between corporate governance and service delivery. The\nresults indicate that risk assessment partially predicts performance in goal oriented firms.\nMormul (2021) investigated risk assessment control in Poland and found low understanding of\nrisk management among employees. The study identified the need for training employees on\nmanagement control systems. This study focused on control systems in local government and\nignored performance. Besides, the findings in Poland may not be transferable to Kabale. From a\npublic sector context, (Eleftheriadis & Vyttas, 2018) examined measurement of risk and\nperformance of public organizations.

The effect was mostly influenced by economic risk. This study\nwas based on public sector in Greece. From Kenya, (Ahmed & Ng’angas, 2019) show that risk\nassessment is a significant predictor of performance of County governments. The predictive\ninfluence is mostly observed in risk identification.\n\n14 | P a g e\n\n2.4 The effect of Control Activities on Service Delivery\nControl activities refer to policies, procedures, and mechanisms put in place to ensure directives\nof the management are properly carried out (Aikins, 2011; Rezaee et al., 2001). Appropriate and\naccurate documentation of policies and procedural guidelines helps to determine how the control\nactivities are to be executed. It also provides adequate information for auditors’ examination of\nthe overall adequacy of control design over financial management practices (Aikins, 2011).\nThese control activities ensure that all necessary actions should be taken with the aim to address\nrisks so that organizational objectives are achieves. According to Rezaee et al. (2001), internal\ncontrol activities occur throughout the organization. They include a range of activities like;\napprovals, authorizations, verifications, reconciliations, reviews of operating performance,\nsecurity of asset and segregation of duties. Most of them are made possible through the help of\nthe internal audit function.\nFurthermore, an investigation by Umar, D. et al (2018) portrayed the effect of internal control\nsystems on the performance of commercial banks in Nigeria. A survey design was employed 382\nrespondents were selected using stratified random sampling. Questionnaire method was\nadministered for data collection. Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 23\nwas used for data analysis. The findings of the study revealed that control activities have a\npositive and significant relationship.\n\nKayondo, B. (2018) examined a study of Internal Control System and Service Delivery in the\nHealth Service Sector of Uganda a Case of Masaka District Local Government. The study\nadopted a case study design and had a study population of 202 and a sample size of 133 which\nwas derived from the Krejcie and Morgan sampling table (1970). Stratified random and\npurposive sampling methods were used by the researcher in data collection.

The study revealed a high positive significant relationship\nbetween risk assessment and education service delivery.\n\nControl activities are another component of internal controls Whittington and Pany (2016), they\nfound out that control activities are policies and procedures that help ensure that management\ndirectives are carried out. Controls activities in an organization basically comprise of\nperformance reviews which involves comparing actual performance with budgets, forecasts, and\nprior period performances. Information processing: (necessary to check accuracy, completeness\nand authorization of transactions). Physical controls: (necessary to provide security over both\nrecords and other assets) and segregation of duties: (where no one person should handle all\naspects of a transaction from the beginning to the end).\n\nIn private sector organizations, approvals and authorizations help in detecting potential areas of\nfraud and prevent them accordingly since many officers are involved in the transaction process\nfrom initiation to completion (Dickens, 2016). By so doing, the organization streamlines\ntransactions and enforces accountability (BCBS, 2010). One of the control activities is\nsegregating duties. According to Russell (2009), segregation of duties requires that one person in\nthe organization is in charge of transactions, making sure that the transaction is complete. In\nlarge organizations, duties are spread across individuals and departments to reduce the level of\nfunds misappropriations (Etuk, 2011). In another usage, segregation of duties reduces role\nambiguity in the sense that different roles are assigned to different individuals and offices during\nthe transaction process Kamau (2014). The entire essence of segregation of duties is to monitor\nthe accounting process and check for any chances of occurrence of error. In the long run, the\norganization is capable of avoiding error at whatsoever cost, which makes all employees get\ninvolved in reducing errors and mistakes.\n\n16 | P a g e", "word_count": 407, "start_char": 43222, "end_char": 46039}

The literature also points out significant challenges in implementing internal\ncontrol, a problem which limits the effectiveness of internal controls in achieving their\nobjectives. In conclusion, it can be observed that the review of existing literature reveals an\nincreasing interest in examining the internal control environment and this portrays a positive\nrelationship to service delivery.\n\n17 | P a g e\n\nCHAPTER THREE\n\nRESEARCH METHODOLOGY\n\n3.1 Introduction\nThis chapter explores the approaches the study used to gain information on the research and they\nincluded, the research design, area of the study, study population, sample size and sampling\ntechniques, data collection procedures, data collection methods, data collection instruments,\nquality control, data management and processing, data analysis, ethical consideration and\nlimitations of the study.\n\n3.2 Research Design\nThis study adopted a descriptive cross-sectional study design with a quantitative method to carry\nout an investigation on the relationship between internal controls and service delivery in Source\nof the Nile Hotel Jinja. According to Saunders et al (2014) cross-sectional study design is carried\nout once and therefore represents a snap shot of one point in time.\n\n3.3 Study population\nThe researcher obtained information from the case study. The researcher then involved all these\ncategories in the study because she assumed as if they had all the study information. The total\nnumber of the study population was (90) people at the Hotel.\nThe study population therefore included that respondents from different departments at the\nCompany including; head of departments, Supervisors, Housekeeping, Security guards, Catering\nand service department that have been selected during the study process in the study area.\n\n3.4 Sample size\nA sample size of 74 respondents was selected from the study area using statistical tables of\nYamen’s formula (1967).

The study used purposive sampling technique since it was to enable the researcher\nto select a sample with experience and knowledge about the study variables and this method was\nused to select all the study respondents.\n\n3.6 Data sources\n\nConcerning data sources, both primary and secondary data were used as the main sources of data\nused in the study.\n\n3.6.1 Primary data\nPrimary data involved use of a questionnaire guide method. During the collection of this data,\nthe researcher had to approach the study area with the research tools as she got responses as per\nthe study respondents. Such data was used to analyze the problem that was at hand.\n\n3.6.2 Secondary data\nThe researcher collected secondary data from different sources like; text books, internet,\nnewspaper, magazines, and journals that were found at Source of the Nile Hotel. This\ninformation was reviewed by visiting places like libraries and internet cafes and this type of\ninformation was used to supplement collected data from different categories of the respondents\nduring data collection.\n\n3.7 Data collection and instruments\n3.7.1 Questionnaire\nThe questionnaire tool was close ended in nature and was self-administered where the researcher\nhad to fill the questionnaire in the study field as per respondents’ responses. The tool was used to\ncollect information from the employees and customers. The questionnaire method of data\ncollection was used because of being cheap and that the method could enable the research collect\nresponses with minimum errors and a high level of confidentiality.\n\n20 | P a g e", "word_count": 408, "start_char": 48221, "end_char": 50742}

Internal control\nsystems were measured by the internal controls used that included; preventative controls,\ndetective controls, corrective controls, control environment, risk assessment, control activities,\ninformation and communication as well as monitoring. However, during the study, performance\nwas commonly measured by the amount of revenue collection, service delivery, expenditure\nperformance, value for money among other measures that were thought of during the process of\nundertaking the study.\n\n3.9 Data analysis\nEditing of collected data was done to make the data ready and simpler for presentation. The\nfilled questionnaires were edited one by one to correct errors that were done by the study\nrespondents. Data was edited in order to check for accuracy, completeness, consistency and\nuniformity and presentation of data involved use of tables which were generated from the\nquestions that were relevant to the study variables.\nThe edited data was then analyzed quantitatively. Quantitative data was grouped and statistical\ndescriptions such as tables showing frequencies and percentages for better interpretation.\nHowever, qualitative data were analyzed in a way of identifying the responses from respondents\nthat was relevant to the research problem and such data was analyzed by explaining the facts\ncollected from the field under which the researcher was able to quote respondents’ responses.\n\n3.10 Ethical consideration\nThe researcher had to respect human dignity by not revealing the identity of the respondents in\nthe study. Under here, letters of introduction were got from the supervisor seeking for permission\nto conduct the study after being directed by the supervisor to do so. These letters were presented\nto the respondents in the study area for permission to conduct the study. Once the permission\nwas granted, the researcher was able to distribute the questionnaires to the respondents in\naddition to interviewing them and the next stage after was analyzing the data collected from the\nstudy respondents.\n\n21 | P a g e\n\n3.11 Limitations of the study\nThe study was limited by finances as it was not enough to cater for secretarial services.

This chapter presents a\ndiscussion, conclusions and recommendations of the study on Internal Control System and\nservice delivery. The first section presents a summary of the study findings in relation to the\nspecific objectives. This is followed by a discussion, conclusion and recommendations of the\nstudy in relation to the objectives of the study. Limitations of the study, contributions of the\nstudy and recommendations for further studies are also presented in this chapter.\n\n5.2 Discussion of findings\n5.2.1 The effect of control Environment on service delivery\nAccording to research findings on the effect of control environment on service delivery, majority\nof the respondents agreed that control environment promotes adherence to laws, regulations and\ninternal policies. However, the results also implied that service delivery at the Source of the Nile\nhotel vis-à-vis the effect of control environment was highly impacted by the control environment\nthat involves separation of duties leading to low chances of engaging in fraudulent behaviors by\nemployees because it had the overall highest response score. These findings are supported by\nAldridge and Colbert, 1994 who asserted that, several aspects discuss control environment acting\nin line with the Board of Directors’ efficiency, the administration, and the enterprise’s audit unit.\nIn this case, internal auditors are key to the success of control environment as the efficacy of\nthese elements is greatly subject to their relationship with the internal as well as external auditor.\nTherefore, the control environment is able to establish the ambience of an enterprise, impelling\nthe control awareness of its entities which is also influenced by the enterprise’s principles,\nhistory and takes a devious bearing on the manner that an enterprise’s undertakings are\norganized.\n\n34 | P a g e", "word_count": 341, "start_char": 69641, "end_char": 71869}

However, the effect of risk assessment on service delivery had a significant\nimpact, for it was evidenced that through effective risk assessment, the Source of the Nile Hotel\ncould understand the potential impact of the risks and prioritize its resources to appropriately\nmanage them. According to Karagiorgos et al., (2009), risk assessment is the process of\nidentifying and analyzing management relevant risks to the preparation of financial statements\nthat would be presented fairly in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. In\norganizations, management must determine the level of risk carefully to be accepted, and try to\nmaintain such risk within manageable levels. It is therefore the management’s responsibility to\ndesign internal controls to ensure efficiency and effectiveness, reliability of financial reporting as\nwell as compliance with laws and regulations. This is ensured by periodic performance review\nand evaluation of the adequacy and effectiveness of the controls designed by the internal\nauditor’s department.\n\n5.2.3 The effect of Control Activities on service delivery\nResearch findings on the effect of control activities on service delivery showed that majority\nstrongly agree that control activities provide reliable and timely information to support decision\nmaking processes. However, it can be concluded that the effect of control activities on service\ndelivery is much felt by emphasizing that internal control systems are put in place in order to\nimprove on service delivery and with the fact that control activities has a significant impact on\nservice delivery at the Hotel. These findings are supported by Whittington and Pany (2016), who\nnoted that control activities are policies and procedures that help ensure that management\ndirectives are carried out. They found out, that controls activities in an organization basically\ncomprise of performance reviews aimed at comparing actual performance with budgets, forecasts\nand prior period performance. They also identified that control activities involve information\nprocessing which is necessary to check accuracy, completeness and authorization during the\ntransaction process. In the same way they argue that physical controls are also necessary to\nprovide security over both records and other organizational assets and segregation of duties\nwhere no one person should handle all aspects of a transaction from the beginning to the end.", "word_count": 447, "start_char": 71566, "end_char": 74570}

The correlation\ncoefficient was found to be moderately positive. Therefore, it can be confirmed that there is a\nstrong relationship between the types of internal control systems and the level of service delivery\nat the Source of the Nile Hotel.\n\n5.4 Recommendations\nThe hotel should adopt the highest level of asset monitoring software to help it curb fraud\ncoming as a result of misappropriated hotel assets.\n\nHotel supervisors should be given high payment and a strict code of conduct so that they do\ncontinuous monitoring and evaluation aimed at keeping a very high standard of operation.\n\nSecurity systems and all necessary apparatus should also be upgraded, through adopting things\nlike online surveillance cameras, drones, and screening of all bags and likely areas of bleaching\ninternal control procedures.\n\nBest customers should be awarded with tokens of appreciation on a yearly basis like trips abroad,\ntelevision sets, phones so that customer’s level of satisfaction are increased.\n\nThe management of the Source of the Nile Hotel should also carry out regular refresher courses\nto upgrade or update its staff of all its internal control systems in order to keep the system well\norganized and able to quickly respond to any queries of its customers.\n\n5.5 Areas of further research\na) The effect of credit accessibility on capitalization of Small and Medium Enterprises.\nb) The relationship between maintaining an effective supply chain on the profitability of a\ncompany.\nc) The role of an effective organizational structure on the performance of an organization.\n\n36 | P a g e", "word_count": 329, "start_char": 74313, "end_char": 76368}
