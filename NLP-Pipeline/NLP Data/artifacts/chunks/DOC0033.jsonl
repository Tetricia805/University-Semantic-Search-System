This study investigates the role of X in\nenhancing communication among university students, with a specific focus on the\ntheoretical underpinnings of gratification theory. By employing a mixed-methods\napproach, this research explores how X influences students' communication\npatterns, satisfaction, and overall academic experience.\nGratification theory, which posits that individuals engage in communication to\nfulfill their social and psychological needs, serves as the theoretical framework for\nthis study. The research design involves a survey of 200 university students,\ncomplemented by in-depth interviews with 20 participants. The findings suggest\nthat X significantly enhances communication among university students by\nincreasing their sense of community, reducing feelings of loneliness, and promoting\na sense of belonging.\nThe results of this study have important implications for university administrators,\neducators, and policymakers seeking to create an environment that fosters\neffective communication and collaboration among students. The findings highlight\nthe potential of X as a tool for promoting student engagement, improving\nacademic outcomes, and enhancing the overall university experience. This\nresearch contributes to the existing body of literature on communication and\ntechnology, providing insights into the role of X in facilitating meaningful\ninteractions among university students.\n\nvi\n\nTABLE OF CONTENT.\nAPPROVAL ........................................................................................ ii\nDEDICATION ...................................................................................... iii\nACKNOWLEGEMENT ............................................................................ iv\nABSTRACT ......................................................................................... v\nCHAPTER ONE ................................................................................... 1\nINTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY ........................................ 1\nIntroduction .................................................................................................................................... 1\nBACKGROUND OF THE STUDY .................................................................................................... 1\n1.3 problem statement. .............................................................................................................. 4\n1.4 General objective .................................................................................................................. 5\n1.5 specific objectives of the study. ....................................................................................... 5\n1.6 research questions. ............................................................................................................... 5\n1.7 JUSTIFICATION OF THE STUDY. .......................................................................................... 6\n1.8 significance of the study. .................................................................................................... 6\n1.9 scope of the study. ................................................................................................................ 7\n1.10 Geography .............................................................................................................................. 7\n1.11 Time scope. ........................................................................................................................... 7\n1.12 Limitation of the study. ..................................................................................................... 8\n1.13 summary of the chapter. ................................................................................................... 8\n\nvii", "word_count": 364, "start_char": 2119, "end_char": 6370}

The UGT focuses on why individuals actively seek out\nspecific media to satisfy various needs such as information, personal relationships\nand social integration.\nThe UGT was first coined by Elihu Katz in 1956 as an extension of earlier media\neffects theories. Unlike traditional perspectives that viewed audiences as passive\nconsumers of media content, the UGT positions individuals as active agents who\nselect media based on their specific needs and desires (Katz, Blumler & Gurevitch,\n1974). The theory has its roots in earlier research on media effects conducted in\nthe 1940s and 1950s particularly studies examining why people consume certain\ntypes of media.\nThe origin of the UGT is tied to the transitions from behaviorist approaches to\nmore cognitive and user-centric perspectives on media consumption. Early\nresearch in this field was driven by an interest in understanding the reasons why\nindividuals chose particular types of media (radio, television) and how used these\nmedia to fulfill their needs for entertainment, social interactions or formation\n(McQuail, 1987). Katz along with Jay G, Blumler and Michael Gurevitch developed\nthe UGT as a way of explaining these processes focusing on the gratifications\npeople seek from media rather than effects media have on them.\nIn the context of this research study, UGT is relevant in understanding how UCU\nstudents use X to meet their communication needs. The theory also provides a\nframework for analyzing the motivation behind student’s choices of communication\ntools and how these tools gratify their needs for academic collaboration, social", "word_count": 332, "start_char": 25354, "end_char": 27505}

For instance, students might use a platform\nlike WhatsApp or Facebook groups to satisfy their need for instant communication\nand social connectivity. Others might turn to more specialized academic platforms\nlike Google Classroom or Microsoft Teams to fulfill their need for structured,\nproductive collaboration on academic projects. This aligns with the core tenets of\nUGT where users are seen as goal-directed in their use media actively choosing\nplatforms that best meet their communication needs (Whiting & Williams, 2013).\nMoreover, UGT helps to explain the diversity in communication preferences among\nstudents at UCU. Different students may gravitate towards different tools based on\ntheir specific gratifications whether it be staying informed, maintaining\nrelationships or managing academic workloads. This understanding is crucial for\nanalyzing how x enhances communication and how it can be optimized to address\nthe various needs of students within the university setting.\n2.3 Empirical literature review\n2.3.1 To explore the use of twitter for communication and engagement amongst\nstudents within Africa and beyond.\nThe integration of social media platforms like x has gained traction in higher\neducation as a tool for enhancing communication and engagement.

This aligns with previous literature review that\nsuggests x is an effective platform for facilitating immediate and concise\ncommunication in educational setting (Junco, Elavsky & Heiberger, 2013).\nThe uses and gratification theory provides a lens to understand this behavior, as\nstudents actively choose x to satisfy specific needs. The theory posits that\nindividuals use media to fulfill particular desires such as the need for social\ninteraction, information seeking and personal identify development (Katz, Blumler\n& Gurevitch, 1973). In the context of communication, students are gratified by x’s\nability to provide fast and direct communication with peers, lecturers and industry\nprofessional.\n\n5.2 to identify the benefits, challenges and opportunities of using x of using x\nas both communication tool and information outlets that supports their studies\n5.2.1 benefits\nThe benefits of using x identified in chapter four such as networking opportunities,\nreal-time information access and enhanced academic engagement are well\nsupported in the literature reviews presented in chapter two.

For example, journalism\nstudents use x to stay updated on industry news, fulfilling their cognitive needs for\ninformation. Meanwhile the ability to network with professional satisfies social\nintegrative needs, helping students build social capital (Ellison, Steinfeld & Lampe,\n2007).\n5.2.2 Challenges of using x as both communication tool and information outlets\nthat supports their studies\nHowever, students also face challenges when using x including information\noverload, time management issues and the spread of misinformation. These\nchallenges align with the previous studies that highlighted the potential negative\neffects of social media use (Lee & Suh, 2016). For example, students struggling to\nmanage their time and filter relevant content from the vast amount of information\non x echoes similar findings by Ahmed and Qazi (2011), who pointed out the risks\nof social media distractions in educational contexts.\nUGT explains that while x may fulfill the need for information and connection, it\nalso introduces problems such as cognitive overload where students become\noverwhelmed by abundance of content.
