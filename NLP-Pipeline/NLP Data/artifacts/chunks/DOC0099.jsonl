The research was focused\non the use of Polyethylene Terephthalate fibre in the reinforcement of hydrated limestabilised expansive soils to improve the properties of these soils. The research had\nspecific objectives which were achieved by following a methodology that had\nimplemented laboratory tests such as Sieve analysis, Atterberg Limits, California\nBearing Ratio, Unconfined Compressive Strength, Free Swell Index, and Proctor\nCompaction on the neat soil along with other samples with a constant 6% content of\nLime and varying percentages of fibre from 0 % to 2 %. There was a Tensile strength test\ndone on the fibre. The tests were done following a given set of standards, after which\nthe results on the neat sample found the soil to be expansive clayey soils and the fibrereinforced soil that was lime stabilised had the optimum mix ratio of 6% lime and 1.5 %\nfibre. The optimum mix ratio had a California Bearing Ratio of 54 % and an Unconfined\nCompressive Strength of 0.59 MPa. The results of the soil mixed with 1.5 % fibre and 6\n% lime all matched the standards of subgrade material according to the Ministry of\nWorks and Transport, General Specifications for Road and Bridge Works, 2005 manual.\nThis implied that hydrated lime and Polyethylene Terephthalate fibre can be\nimplemented in the improvement of properties of expansive soils to acceptable\nstandards for subgrade material. There is a need for more research into the use of other\nfibres in the reinforcement of lime-stabilised soils.\n\nii\n\nDECLARATION\nI, MANANA MARK, declare that this Research and Design Project Report is my original\nwork and has never been submitted to any institution of higher learning for an award\nof academic qualification.\nSignature:............................

These \"swell-shrink\" soils, as they're sometimes called,\ncause billions in damage annually to pavements and structures. Expansive soils undergo\nnotable volume alterations due to fluctuations in moisture levels. These changes can\nresult in either swelling or shrinkage, which is why they are also referred to as\nswell/shrink soils (Jones & Jefferson, 2012). The shrink-swell phenomenon in soils is\nattributed to their mineral composition. Clay soils containing specific mineral types like\nmontmorillonite, smectite, or vermiculite are especially susceptible to this shrink-swell\nbehaviour (Lees, 2021). The expansive soils are found particularly in the Eastern and\nNorthern parts of Uganda in districts such as Nakapiripirit and, such areas require\nsuitable subgrade material for road construction.\nLime-stabilised soil exhibits superior strength enhancement properties. However, it\nsuffers from low tensile strength and tends to develop significant cracking because the\nlime-stabilised soil becomes brittle. To address this limitation and further enhance the\nmechanical properties of the stabilised soil, there is a need to use PET fibres to\nreinforce such soil. This reinforcement aims to minimise both vertical and lateral\ndeformation within the lime-stabilised soil (Wei, et al., 2018).\n\n1.2 Problem Statement\nEngineers come across a range of problematic soils, such as expansive soils, during road\nconstruction projects that pose significant obstacles. Because highly flexible clay\nminerals like aluminium and iron, which alternately expand and contract with variable\nmoisture concentrations, are present in expansive soils, the roadways get cracked and\ncollapse (Jones & Jefferson, 2012) . Expansive soils along the chainages of 47+800 km\nof the Muyembe-Nakapiripirit road were found to have expansive soils which have issues\nof experiencing constant volumetric changes due to moisture content variations in the\nsubgrade resulting in pavement damage, and this has led to disruption of normal traffic\nflow on the road according to UNRA.\nThe issue of heaving was found to disrupt the normal movement of vehicles along the\nroad section with the expansive soils. Lime stabilisation is a technique that has been\napplied in the controlling of the swell-shrink characteristics of the expansive soil.\nHowever, the sulphate present in the expansive soils leads to the lime stabilisation\nbeing ineffective. The experimental research showed that sulphate contamination had\na substantial outcome on the soil profile, and the index properties of lime-stabilised\nsoil which led to brittle failure of soil and a reduction in strength properties (Raja &\nThyagaraj, 2021).\nThe response to the problem is to use the Polyethylene Terephthalate fibre to reinforce\nthe lime-stabilised soils to improve the strength properties of such soils.", "word_count": 433, "start_char": 14062, "end_char": 17046}

Lime has been widely used in stabilisation, despite\nbeing associated with cases of low strength properties, failing to carry the loading of\nthe structure in some cases influenced by different factors such as sulphate attack,\ncarbonation, and so on. Normally 2 to 8 % of lime may be required for coarse-grained\nsoils and 5 to 8 % of lime may be required for plastic soils. (Lone & Sachar, 2022).\nCombining PET fibre with lime affirms that lime stabilisation has a more pronounced\npositive impact on strength. Additionally, the optimal strength for clayey soil\nreinforcement occurs with a 1.5 % fibre. Typically, reinforcement with strips results in\nhigher strength, as indicated by the point load strength index, and greater flexibility\nunder applied impact loads.

(Koohmishi & Palassi, 2022).\n\nPlastic pollution is a massive problem. Every year, hundreds of millions of tons of plastic\ntrash are produced, and a huge portion ends up in our environment where it can last\nfor many years. Millions of tons also wind up in our oceans each year. If no action is\ntaken, this plastic pollution will keep growing at an alarming rate. Thus there is the\nneed to find ways to either get rid of plastic waste entirely or develop environmentally\nfriendly methods to reuse it (Urian, et al., 2023). The Polyethylene Terephthalate waste\ncan be used to get the fibre to be used in the reinforcement of the expansive soils\nstabilised with lime.\n1.6 Significance\nThe project will advance the knowledge of soil stabilisation and develop a method for\nimplementing the Polyethylene Terephthalate fibre in the reinforcement of limestabilised expansive soils. This is significant because there will be no need for merely\nexcavating and dumping such soils, resulting in cost savings as well as time saved in\nprocuring labour and machinery to remove the given expansive soils. Furthermore, the\nproject will provide the opportunity to use the good strength properties of Polyethylene\nTerephthalate fibre in improving the strength properties of lime-stabilised expansive\nsoils.", "word_count": 260, "start_char": 19267, "end_char": 20923}

These fluctuations, characterized by drying and wetting cycles, lead to\nshrinkage and swelling, causing considerable differential movements in building\nfoundations and highway pavements. Such movements, influenced by changes in water\ncontent and tension, are most severe in fine-grained soils with high plasticity. Expansive\nsoils are responsible for common types of cracks and distress observed in pavement\ninfrastructure, with longitudinal cracking indicative of volumetric changes in the\npavement subgrade. These differential movements significantly impact pavement\nperformance, reducing its service life. Engineering practitioners are currently seeking\nfeasible and implementable solutions to mitigate the effects of seasonal pavement\nsurface movements on both the functional and structural aspects of pavement\nstructures (Sarker & Wang, 2022).\nFurthermore, the shrinking and swelling are seen to be partly irreversible processes,\nand this implies that the damage to structures particularly road pavements and\nbuildings can be a continuous occurrence (King, n.d.).\n2.2 Soil Stabilisation\nSoil stabilisation is the use of biological, chemical, or mechanical methods to improve\nthe engineering properties of soil to increase its workability. Such properties include\nshear strength, permeability, compressibility, durability, and plasticity.

Soil stabilisation can be accomplished by several methods.\nAll these methods fall into two broad categories namely;\n1. Mechanical stabilisation\nUnder this category, soil stabilisation can be achieved through a physical process by\naltering the physical nature of native soil particles by either induced vibration or\ncompaction or by incorporating other physical properties.\n2. Chemical stabilisation\nSoil stabilisation depends mainly on chemical reactions between the stabiliser\n(cementitious material) and soil minerals to achieve the desired results. By adding these\nstabilisers, loose soil particles become bound together, creating a stronger and more\nstable material. Compared to natural soil, stabilised soil is less likely to absorb water\n(lower permeability), resists compression better, and is generally stronger. The specific\ntype of stabiliser used depends on which weaknesses of the natural soil need to be\naddressed. In the world of engineering, the key soil properties of concern are how much\nthe soil shrinks or swells (volume stability), its strength, how much it compresses under\npressure, and how easily water can pass through it (THE CONSTRUCTOR, n.d.).\n2.2.1 Selection of a suitable Soil chemical stabiliser\nThere are predominantly two common chemicals used as soil stabilisers, and these are\nlime and cement in particular. However, the decision on what chemical stabiliser to use\ncame from the guidance of the Ministry of Works and Transport General specifications\nfor Roads and Bridges 2010 manual (SERIES 3000) as illustrated below.\n\n% passing the 0.075\nmm sieve\nBS 1377-2\nBS 1377: Part 2\nBest suited stabiliser\nLess than 25%\nPI is less than 6\nor PI x (% passing 0.075 mm) is\nless than 60\nCement only 1)\n6 – 10\nCement preferred\nMore than 10\nCement and/or lime\nMore than 25%\nLess than 10\nCement preferred\n10 – 20\nCement and/or lime\nMore than 20\nLime preferred 2)\n\nTable 1: Guide to the selection of stabiliser.

The two parameters were utilised in unison, and this was in that the given\nPlasticity Index obtained had to correlate with the percentage passing to communicate\nthe chemical stabiliser to be used on the expansive soils.", "word_count": 414, "start_char": 22408, "end_char": 25030}

Hydrated lime can either be a white\npowder or a white putty-like material. It can be used in various applications, including\nconstruction, and chemical manufacturing. It is commonly used as a building material,\nparticularly as a mortar for bricklaying and plastering. Hydrated lime has several\nadvantages over other types of lime. It is easy to handle and store as a wet putty or dry\npowder. It is also less caustic than Quicklime, making it safer to handle. Additionally,\nit has a longer shelf life than quicklime, as it does not react with air as quickly\n(LimePlanet, 2023).

Lime with a high\ncomposition of Calcium Hydroxide is taken to be of high purity (MINTEK RESOURCES,\nn.d.).\n2.2.3 Lime in Soil Stabilisation\nLime soil stabilisation involves enhancing soil properties such as density and bearing\ncapacity by adding lime. The factors influencing this process include soil and lime types,\nlime content, compaction, and curing duration. When lime is introduced to the soil, a\npozzolanic reaction occurs, where pozzolana materials react with lime in the presence\nof water to generate cementitious compounds. The fundamental mechanism behind\nlime-soil stabilisation is the ion exchange between lime and soil. Treating clayey soil\nwith lime facilitates cation exchange, leading to increased plastic limit and reduced\nplasticity index, thereby enhancing soil stability. Lime also acts as a binding agent for\nclayey gravel when clay contains gravel within it. The addition of lime to pozzolanic\nsoil in water results in a reaction where calcium hydroxide from the lime reacts with\nsiliceous and aluminous materials in the soil, creating a mixture with cementitious\nproperties, known as the pozzolanic reaction. This reaction boosts the strength of the\nlime-soil mixture, with strength gradually increasing over time as the pozzolanic\nreaction continues for extended periods (THE CONSTRUCTOR, n.d.).\nNormally 2 to 8 % of lime may be required for coarse-grained soils and 5 to 8 % of lime\nmay be required for plastic soils. (Lone & Sachar, 2022).However, the reaction between\nsulphate and alumina in soils and the calcium of excess lime can lead to soil swelling", "word_count": 325, "start_char": 25677, "end_char": 27756}

(Lone & Sachar, 2022).However, the reaction between\nsulphate and alumina in soils and the calcium of excess lime can lead to soil swelling\n\nthat may contribute to expansion by hydration, and this swelling can lead to the\nweakening of the soil strength of the expansive soils (Wang, et al., 2019).\n2.3 Soil reinforcement\nSoil reinforcement is a method employed to enhance the strength and rigidity of soil.\nVarious engineering methods, such as geogrid and geotextile, are utilized to bolster soil\nstrength. This involves integrating earth fill with reinforcing strips, capable of\nwithstanding significant tensile forces. Soil reinforcement represents a contemporary\napproach utilized across diverse projects to avert soil slope failures and enhance soilbearing capacity (Civil Wale, n.d.).\nFibre-reinforced soil is characterized as a soil mixture containing randomly dispersed\ndiscrete elements, namely fibres, which enhance the mechanical properties of the soil\ncomposite. This type of soil acts as a composite material, with high-tensile-strength\nfibres embedded within a soil matrix. When subjected to shear stresses, the soil\nactivates tensile resistance within the fibres, thereby augmenting the overall strength\nof the soil (Hejazi, et al., 2012).\nSoil reinforcement stands out as a dependable and practical approach for enhancing\nthe properties of fine-grained soil. Various technologies such as metallic strips, bars,\ngeogrids, geotextiles, and fibres are widely recognized for this purpose. Utilizing\nmetallic strips, geogrids, or geotextiles reinforces soil by enhancing its tensile strength\nin a specific direction.

Fibres are simply blended into the soil, similar to other agents\nlike lime or cement. This approach mimics the activity of plant roots, maintaining\nstrength isotropy and minimizing the formation of weak planes in the reinforcement\ndirection. Moreover, these fibre additives solely modify the physical properties of the\nsoil without any adverse environmental impact. Compared to untreated soils, those\nreinforced with fibres demonstrate enhanced ductility and no decrease in post-peak\nstrength. Synthetic fibres, owing to their consistent material properties and\nrepeatability, are deemed suitable for reinforcement purposes (Zafar, et al., 2023).\n2.3.1 Fibre-reinforced soil\nFibres rooted in the soil can vary in form, texture, stiffness, content, length or aspect\nratio, orientation and so on among which content, length and orientation of fibres are\nthe most practical concerns in geotechnical applications. Fibre-reinforced soil can be\ngrouped into two categories according to their method of application: Oriented\nDistributed Fibre-reinforced Soil and Randomly Distributed Fibre-reinforced Soil.\n\nFigure 1:Classification and illustration of Fibre reinforcement mechanism of\nsoil.Source ( Gowthaman, et al., 2018).", "word_count": 224, "start_char": 29116, "end_char": 30735}

Its operational principle mirrors the geosynthetic methods, wherein\nmaterials such as geo-grids, geo-mats, and geo-textiles are utilized to reinforce weaker\nsoil layers. By introducing fibres, ODFS boosts the frictional strength along the\nreinforced planes, while the un-reinforced sections depend solely on their inherent\nstrength. This approach may result in the formation of potential failure planes in\nweaker, unreinforced zones. Alternatively, RDFS is a widely accepted method for\nenhancing soil quality, where fibres with desired characteristics and quantities are\nrandomly mixed and compacted in situ. The adoption of RDFS has gained traction\nrecently due to its simplicity: short discrete fibres can be easily blended with soil, akin\nto adding cement, lime, or other additives. This approach offers a uniform increase in\nthe strength of the soil composite without introducing continuous weak planes. The\nRDFS technique capitalizes on the natural behaviour of plant roots, which reinforce soil\nby adding friction and interlocking. Initially, when the soil particles undergo stress, they\ncompact and cause fibre deformation. Subsequently, as soil particles rotate and directly\nimpact the fibres, they generate direct forces during the fibre-soil interlocking phase.\nAt the same time, soil particles in contact with the fibres induce frictional forces in\naddition to interlocking forces. Eventually, these interlocking and frictional forces work\ntogether to activate tensile stress on the fibre material. Additionally, the random\narrangement of fibres promotes adhesive bonding between the fibres and soil,\nenhancing composite strength. The interaction of the flexible fibres acts as a structural\nmesh, effectively binding the soil together and improving its structural integrity. The\n\nRDFS mechanism was found to be the more applicable method when doing fibre\nreinforcement within soils ( Gowthaman, et al., 2018).", "word_count": 339, "start_char": 30429, "end_char": 32835}

They encompass a range\nof products like geotextiles, geogrids, geocells, geomembranes, erosion control mats,\nand geo-composites. Geotextiles, the most prevalent among these, trace their earliest\nknown application back to sand-filled nylon bags used in the Dutch Delta Works in 1956.\nOver the past six decades, geotextiles have become integral to geotechnical\nengineering, serving purposes such as filtration, drainage, reinforcement, and erosion\nprotection ( Wu, et al., 2020).\n\nGeosynthetics, specifically geotextiles crafted from synthetic polymers like PP and PET,\nare produced abundantly due to cost-effectiveness and the ease of obtaining fibres\nthrough melt-spinning technology. Their impressive mechanical strength, durability,\nand hydrophobicity make them ideal for various geotechnical engineering tasks, such\nas enhancing the load-bearing capacity of soil for construction site preparation such as\nroad works (Tanasă, et al., 2022).\nIn recent years, the utilization of randomly dispersed fibres in clayey soil for soil\nimprovement applications has gained considerable attention in geotechnical\nengineering research. Incorporating these fibres into the soil has been observed to\nenhance shear strength, soil soil-bearing capacity, diminish settlements, and restrict\nlateral deformations. Both natural and synthetic fibres offer significant advantages,\nincluding cost-effectiveness and the potential for synthetic fibre production through\nplastic waste recycling. Recycling polyethene terephthalate (PET) presents two main\napproaches: mechanical and chemical methods. Mechanical recycling involves\ntechniques such as PET shredding using specialized machinery, which alters the physical\nform of PET without changing its chemical composition. (Kalkan, et al., 2020).\nFurthermore, the fibres enhance shear strength by establishing an interlocking matrix\nbetween the fibres and the soil. Fibres play a role in restraining soil movement under\nexternal stresses. Moreover, the formation of a gel within the stabilised soil matrix binds\nsoil particles together, augmenting the strength of lime-stabilised soil with fibre\nreinforcements as compared to untreated soil (Tamassoki, et al., 2022).", "word_count": 426, "start_char": 32424, "end_char": 35512}

There were two trial pits dug to an\naverage depth of 0.5m along one pathway which was offset from the road stretch. The\ndigging was done using a pickaxe and spades, and the dug soil samples were placed in\neight tightly closed sacks with each sack carrying fifty kilograms of soil. Some soil\nsamples were packed in two airtight bags each with a capacity of one kilogram. The\npacked soil samples were then all loaded onto a vehicle to be transported to the\nlaboratory where the soil tests were to be conducted. The soil was air-dried for two\ndays.\nb) Hydrated Lime\nThe hydrated lime was purchased from a hardware store in Mukono District in Uganda.\n\nc) Polyethylene Terephthalate Fibre\nThe PET material makes a variety of plastic bottles used by beverage companies for\ndrinks like water and soda in particular. Hence the first step was to acquire an amount\nof around five kilograms of PET plastic waste bottles. The bottles were then washed\nwith water and soap to remove any dirt. The clean plastic waste bottles were taken for\ncutting using a pair of scissors to remove the top part of the bottle and the lower part\nto allow for the acquisition of a sheet of plastic to be cut. The plastic sheets were then\nselectively chopped to a given size of 2mm in diameter and length of 20 mm.

The chapter further dealt with the breakdown of\nthe results and graphical representation of the data of the tests on the soil along with\nthe PET fibre. There was further interpretation and analysis of the test conducted on\nthe material in particular the Polyethylene Terephthalate fibre along with the tests\ndone on the soil stabilised with the hydrated lime and varying percentages of the\nPolyethylene Terephthalate fibre.\n4.1 Physical Properties of the Neat Soil Sample\nThe aspect of the physical properties of the neat soil sample dealt with the first specific\nobjective of the project. The physical properties of the soil were obtained through the\nvarious tests associated with specific objective one, and the various tests done to get\nsuch physical properties of the neat soil sample were as mentioned below\n4.1.1 Particle Size Distribution\nParticle Size Distribution involved the use of Sieve analysis with reference to BS 1377\nPart 2:1990. Sieve analysis was done to determine the grading of a given soil sample.\nThe result was a particle size distribution curve which represents the grading of the soil\nsample. It was done for coarse soils as the particles can be differentiated by passing\nthrough different sieve sizes. This gave the relative portions of various particle sizes\nthat are contained in the soil sample which are gravel, silt, sand, or clay, and which\n\none was predominant and hence capable of controlling the engineering properties of\nthe soil.\n\nFigure 4: Particle Size Distribution graph of the neat soil sample\nThe Particle size distribution graph indicated that the percentage passing through the\n0.075 mm sieve was 81 % which was greater than 50 %, which implied that the given\nsoils were poorly graded along with the fact that most of the soil particles were lying\nwithin the fine grain range. The indication of poorly graded soils likely to be clayey\nimplied that there was a need for stabilisation.\n4.1.2 Atterberg Limits\nThe Atterberg limits were needed to classify soils for engineering purposes.

The average value for the liquid limit for neat sample-1 was 75.6 %.\nThe maximum value for the LL for neat sample-2 was 80.5 % at a depth of 0.5m and the\nminimum value was 70.7 % at 0.5m. The average value for the Liquid Limit for neat\nsample-2 was 76.0 %. The average value for the LL for all samples was taken as 75.8 %.\n4.1.2.2 Plastic Limit\nThe average value for the Plastic Limit of neat sample 1 was 37.5 % at depths of 0.5m.\nThe average value for the Plastic Limit for neat sample-2 was taken as 37.6 %.

The\naverage was 38.2 %. The PI of 38.2 % was found to be high and this implied that the\ngiven soil could easily have discrepancies in volume when the soil moisture content is\nvaried.\n4.1.2.4 Linear Shrinkage\nThe linear shrinkage limit for neat sample-1 was 20% for neat sample-2 was 20% at a\ndepth of 0.5m. The average value for all the samples was 20%. Linear Shrinkage is the\nphenomenon that refers to the transition of soil from a partial to a full solid state,\nduring which no additional volume change takes place. It's important to highlight that\nsoil shrinkage during this process leads to the formation of cracks within the soil mass.\nThese cracks not only increase the soil's permeability to water but also pose potential\nrisks of damage to geotechnical structures ( Pratama, et al., 2021).\n\nLiquid Limit (%)\nPlastic Limit (%)\nNeat Sample 1\n75.6\n37.5\n38.1\nNeat Sample 2\n76.0\n37.6\n38.4\n75.8\n37.6\n38.2\n\nTable 3:Summary of the Atterberg Limits results of the neat soil sample\nApplying the use of the Plasticity chart based on the Unified Soil Classification System\nfound the soils to be classified as inorganic clays of high plasticity, CH.

Elongation is believed to be connected to the tensile strength\nof a fibre (Aishwarya & Rachel, 2023). The degree to which the tensile strength of the\n\nfibre is utilised was thought to depend on the extent of fibre elongation during shearing,\nhence the substantial elongation value of 63.6 % led to a high tensile strength value of\n224.6 MPa. Additionally, it was essential to have assumed a particular distribution of\ntensile stress along the fibre length. The elongation and tensile strength were noted to\nvary depending on the cross-sectional area of the fibre (Shukla, 2017). With a tensile\nstrength of 224.6 MPa, the PET fibre was able to resist the minimal tensile stresses\ndispersed within the fibre-reinforcement structure without jeopardising the integrity\nof the PET fibre (PolyGlobal, 2018).\nElongation has been noted to have had a strong correlation with the strength of\nindividual fibres. Additionally, the influence of artificial weak-link effects introduced\nduring testing also affected the breaking elongation (Bunsell, 2018). The distributed\ntension caused by fibres depended on both the content and the ultimate tensile\nstrength of each fibre when the major mode of failure was fibre breakage (Palmeira,\net al., 2008). The elongation of the PET fibre was found to be 63.6 %.

This was due to the\nincreased amount of solid PET fibres which bound the soil particles (Tamassoki, et al.,\n2022). The cohesion effect of the 6 % hydrated lime on the soil led to the formation of\nbigger particles (Firoozi, et al., 2017). The result was a decrease in the percentage of\nfines with the addition of the fibres and lime making the soil a better distribution of\nthe various soil particles.\n0.01\n0.1\nPercentage passing (%)\nSieve size (mm)\n6% lime only\n6% lime and\n0.5% PET\n6% lime and 1%\nPET\n6% lime and\n1.5% PET\n6% lime and 2%\nPET\n\n4.3.2 MDD and OMC\n4.3.2.1 MDD\n\nFigure 10: MDD against Composition\nThe pozzolanic reactions between the 6% lime and the expansive soils resulted in the\nreduction of MDD and the increase in OMC of the mixtures investigated. The decrease\nin MDD was attributed to the immediate formation of cementitious reaction products\nat particle contact points, which increased the porosity and thus reduced the MDD of\nthe mixture ( Abdi , et al., 2021). The addition of plastic fibres of 0.5 %, 1.0 % and 1.5\n% into the soil decreased the number of voids thus improving effective compaction and\n1.4\n1.42\n1.44\n1.46\n1.48\n1.5\n1.52\n1.54\n1.56\n1.58\nMDD (g/cm3)\n\ncohesion hence leading to an increase in the MDD of the plastic-soil mixture ( Kalliyath,\net al., 2016).\nHowever, with the addition of 2 % of PET fibre to the lime-stabilised, it was seen that\nthe MDD of the soil decreased. An excessive amount of fibres acted like a lubricant,\nreducing the friction between soil particles and hindering the interlocking mechanisms,\nand that compromised the soil strength. This drop in the MDD was attributed to the\nproperties of the fibre-reinforced soil due to a weaker soil structure with voids to allow\nfor greater water movement and retention (Aishwarya & Rachel, 2023).\n4.3.2.2 OMC\n\nFigure 11: Moisture Content against Composition\nMoisture Content (%)", "word_count": 416, "start_char": 52329, "end_char": 54786}

Following the addition of 6 % hydrated Lime,\nthe cation exchange and flocculation process ensued, causing an increase in grain size,\nsubsequent expansion of void ratio, and consequently, a decrease in maximum dry\ndensity accompanied by an elevation in optimum moisture content. The compaction\ncurve flattening post-lime treatment allows for achieving the prescribed density across\na broader moisture content range. Jan and Mir associated these alterations with the\nreduction in diffuse double-layer thickness due to heightened cation concentration\n(Manzoor & Yousuf, 2020).\nGenerally, the OMC values for fibre contents of 0.5 %, 1.0 %, and 1.5 % indicated that\nadding plastic waste materials to soil reduced the OMC. This occurred because the\nplastics lack absorbent properties compared to clay soil replaced by plastic fibres,\nwhich have a strong attraction to water due to their surface tension ( Hassan, et al.,\n2021).\nWhen 2 % PET fibre was added, the OMC of the soil increased, but it led to failure in\nthe reinforced samples due to cracking. The cracks initiated diagonally from the top\nand bottom of the sample, extending gradually towards the middle. This caused some\nsurface blocks of the reinforced soil to detach. Eventually, these cracks merged to form\na predominant shear plane at failure. As the fibre content increased, the failure pattern\nshifted from ductile to brittle in the reinforced soil. The cracks meant that paths were\ncreated which allowed for the movement of water within the soil matrix hence\nincreasing the moisture content within this soil (Lawer, et al., 2021).\n\n4.3.3 Atterberg Limits\n4.3.3.1 Plasticity Index\n\nFigure 12: Plasticity Index against Composition\nThe inclusion of 6 % hydrated lime caused drying primarily through chemical alterations\nin the soil, reducing its water retention capacity and enhancing stability.

The given trend for the PI illustrated a reduction of the soil reinforced\nwith fibre contents ranging from 0.5 % to 2 %.

When water and lime\nare added to clayey soil, lime breaks down into Ca2+ and OH- ions. The Ca2+ ions then\nreplace monovalent ions such as Na+ and Li+ that are adsorbed to the surface of clay\nminerals. This binding of Ca2+ ions to the clay mineral surface led to a reduction in\nrepulsive forces and a decrease in the thickness of the diffuse water layer. As a result,\nsoil particles drew closer together, a process commonly referred to as flocculation, and\nthe process of flocculation allowed for the formation of large soil particles that are\ninterlocked and able to withstand greater loadings applied to them (Manzoor & Yousuf,\n2020).\nA noticeable stiffer response with increasing penetration was observed with the\naddition of fibre content from 0.5 to 1.5 % in intervals of 0.5 %. This improvement in\nsoil properties was due to the fibre addition. The fibre addition meant that the\nrandomly distributed discrete fibres reinforced the soft soil subgrade under heavy loads\nleading to improved strength for the soil which may suffer excessive deformation when\nleft unreinforced (Hasrajani, et al., 2015). The rise in CBR of lime-stabilised fibrereinforced soil was credited to the considerable improvement in the bearing capacity\nfacilitated by the addition of discrete fibres. With an increase in the plastic content\nwithin the soil bed, the load-bearing capacity of the footing escalated up to a certain\nthreshold, beyond which it diminished ( Iravanian & Haider, 2020).\nA decrease was noted after reinforcing the soil with 2 % PET fibre. The decrease of the\nCBR due to the further addition of plastic to the soil was because more plastic fibres\ninto the soil sample led to the segregation of the soil-plastic matrix during compaction\n\nhence causing poor bonding between the materials (Raghu, 2018). An excessive amount\nof fibres acted like a lubricant, reducing the friction between soil particles and\nhindering the interlocking mechanisms, and that led to a weaker overall soil structure.\nThis decline might have been due to the abundance of waste plastics, which could have\ncompromised the strength of the soil. Consequently, this resulted in reduced strength\nand a less robust soil structure overall ( Niyomukiza, et al., 2021).\n4.3.5 Unconfined Compressive Strength", "word_count": 443, "start_char": 57579, "end_char": 60281}
