The\nstudy sought to achieve three specific objectives: to examine the effect of adoption of e\nprocurement systems on organizational performance, to examine the effect of data security on\norganizational performance and to investigate the supplier readiness on e-procurement systems on\norganizational performance. To achieve these objectives, a mixed-methods research approach was\nadopted. Data was collected through a pre-tested close ended questionnaires and interviews with\nstaff at multiple small and medium enterprises and different departments like logistics,\nprocurement, ICT, and others.\nThe study revealed a strong positive correlation between the adoption of e-procurement systems\non organizational performance, with a significant relationship between the two. The research\nresults suggested that the consistent use of digital procurement tools like e-auctioning, e-tendering,\ndata security and effective management practices is very crucial for enhancing the performance of\nSmall and medium enterprises in Nakawa Division.\nData was collected using self-administered questionnaires. This study employed both stratified\nsampling and simple random sampling techniques to select the sample size of 100 respondents that\nwere involved in the study. The findings of this study revealed that embracement of electronic\nprocurement contributes to the organization in different ways and that E-procurement systems\ncontributes organizational performance inform of increasing Profit margins, enhancing operational\nefficiency, data security and promoting supplier relationships, The study also recommends that\nSMES should continue utilizing e-procurement systems to enhance operational efficiency, supplier\nrelationship management, and overall organizational performance especially with in its\nprocurement processes.

Traditional manual procurement methods are\nincreasingly inadequate to meet the demands of modern organizations, which require greater\nefficiency, transparency, and cost-effectiveness. As a result, many organizations have turned to\ndigital transformation initiatives, particularly in procurement.\nE-procurement, the adoption of digital technologies to support sourcing, vendor management, and\nbuying activities, offers numerous benefits such as increased regulatory compliance, supply base\nrationalization, and enhanced value chain transparency. It represents a paradigm shift from\nviewing procurement as a mere operational task to a strategic lever for achieving business\nobjectives.\nWhile some countries have made significant strides in e-procurement adoption, others, including\nUganda, lag behind due to socioeconomic disparities and technological infrastructure limitations.\nThe government of Uganda has recognized the importance of digital governance and has\nimplemented policies to promote e-procurement, but challenges such as integration complexities,\ndata security risks, and regulatory compliance issues persist, particularly for small and medium\nenterprises (SMEs).\nThis study aims to investigate the barriers and opportunities facing Ugandan public procurement\nentities (PDEs) in adopting e-procurement. By understanding these factors, policymakers,\npractitioners, and stakeholders can develop strategies to effectively leverage e-procurement for\nsustainable development and economic growth in Uganda.\n1.1 Background of the Study\nIn today's networked world economy, each business has an urgent need to economize its\nprocurement processes in such a way that it is able to deliver goods and services to its consumers\non time.

Consequently, many organizations around the world have adopted digital\ntransformation initiatives, especially in procurement. This transition, better known as eprocurement, involves the adaptation of digital technologies to support sourcing, vendor\nmanagement, and buying activities. Some of the benefits available with e-procurement include\nincreased procurement regulation adherence, supply base rationalization, and increased value\nchain transparency in procurement. It represents a paradigm shift from seeing procurement as an\noperational task to a lever of strategy in meeting business objectives.\nIn Africa, particularly East Africa, the adoption of e-procurement across countries varies\nsignificantly. While some countries have made sufficient strides in integrating digital technologies\ninto procurement processes, others, including Uganda, still remain quite behind. This has been\npartly influenced by the prevailing socioeconomic diversities and differences in levels of\ntechnological infrastructure. On this note, e-procurement remains a challenge for both the public\nand private sectors within Uganda. According to the Public Procurement and Disposal of Assets\nAct (2003), electronic means shall be employed for procurement. This was supposed to help in\nenhancing efficiency, transparency, and accountability in procurement. Despite such a legislative\nframework, manual procurement systems still dominate, especially among Small and Medium\nEnterprises. Such retrogressive practices lead to increased transaction costs and weakened service\ndelivery.\nThe Government of Uganda has adopted policies that favor digital governance through policies\nsuch as the National Electronic Government Framework of 2010. This framework has indicated\nthe adoption of technology to realize efficient service delivery and accountability in public\nprocurement.

The adoption of the e-procurement process in SMEs is afflicted with\ninefficiency, lack of transparency, and corruption. These have resulted in poor service delivery,\nmismanagement of finances, and eroded public trust in SMEs. While several attempts have been\nmade to enhance such transition, previous studies obtained inconsistent findings from Mafukata\nand Mapuva (2020), making it difficult to fully understand the adoption of e-procurement systems\non organizational performance of SMEs; hence there is a need for further studies into this area.\n1.3 Main Objective of the Study\nThe main objective of the study was to examine the effect of the adoption of e-procurement\nsystems on the organizational performance of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in\nNakawa Division.\n1.4 Objectives of the study\ni.)

It is also\nexpected that the study helped business owners and managers to plan and manage their companies,\nparticularly with regards to e-procurement. They were able to identify which e-procurement\nprocesses and technologies are to be adopted and utilized.\nThe findings of the study were useful for procurement practitioners and decision-makers both in\ngovernment and the business community, as they provide insights into why SMEs fail to adopt eprocurement processes despite their vital role in survival and operations.\nMoreover, it is hoped that the research would contribute to the knowledge of academics and\nresearchers about the procurement practices of SMEs and how these influence their performance.\nThe findings of the research are finally expected to contribute to the existing knowledge regarding\nthe issue at hand about e-procurement and its impact on SMEs.\n1.7 Scope of the Study\n1.7.1 Content Scope\nThe research focused on SMEs, specifically those engaged in wholesale and retail trade activities\nin Nakawa Division.

It begins with a definition of e-procurement, followed by a\ntheoretical review, a literature review based on the study's objectives, a research gap analysis, and\nconcludes with a summary.\n2.1 Definition of E-Procurement\nE-procurement is the use of advanced technology, the internet, and networking systems for\nprocurement. It encompasses transactions conducted through online systems or over digital\nnetworks and platforms, representing a broad range of activities facilitated by modern technologies\nand business-vendor partnerships. E-procurement involves the use of ICT throughout the buying\nphase, from requirement identification to payment and contract management. It is important to\nnote that e-procurement does not include older applications involving telephone ordering but does\ninvolve the use of the internet, intranet, and extranet applications throughout the purchasing\nprocess.\nAdditionally, e-procurement involves online purchases of goods and services for daily business\noperations, as well as the approval of the entire process with the goal of cost reduction. Proper\nimplementation of e-procurement does not merely facilitate online purchasing but also links\norganizations and their business operations with suppliers and regulates all communications\nbetween them (Saastamoinen et al., 2018).\n2.2 Theoretical Review\nThis section reviews prominent theories related to procurement systems, focusing on adoption\ntheory and its connection to e-procurement concepts.

TAM postulates that perceived usefulness (PU) and\nperceived ease of use (PEOU) are the pivotal determinants in influencing an individual's intention\nto use and actual usage behavior of a technology. This model is particularly applicable to the\nadoption of e-procurement among SMEs, as it focuses on the factors affecting organizational\nmembers' acceptance of technological innovations.\nResearch involving the use of TAM in the e-procurement domain has identified perceived\nusefulness as a predictor of attitude toward the adoption of electronic procurement systems. SME\nowners and employees are more likely to adopt the system when they perceive it to improve\nprocurement efficiency, lower costs, enable better decision-making, and facilitate closer\nrelationships with suppliers (Venkatesh & Davis, 2000).\nIn addition, perceived ease of use also plays a significant role in the adoption process. If the eprocurement systems are perceived to be user-friendly and easily integrated within the current\nprocurement practices with no extensive training or technical expertise, then their adoption is more\nlikely (Venkatesh et al., 2003).\nMore recent studies have continued to support TAM's applicability in explaining the dynamics of\nadopting e-procurement. For instance, Saastamoinen et al. (2018) adopted TAM in investigating\nthe adoption of e-procurement systems in organizational procurement processes and proved its\nefficiency in predicting the behavior of technology adoption. Similarly, Bag et al. (2020) posited\nthat perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use play an important role in adopting eprocurement technologies among SMEs.\nThe aim of this study is to explain how perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use influence\nthe adoption of e-procurement systems among SMEs in Nakawa Division, Kampala District, using\nthe TAM theoretical framework. This led to the exposure of underlying motivations and deterrents\nthat shape the drive toward adoption with related organizational performance regarding eprocurement implementation.", "word_count": 332, "start_char": 22740, "end_char": 25083}

Through integration, a long-term relationship between a corporation\nand its suppliers is developed. Collaboration or integration has been identified as one of the most\nimportant building blocks of SCM. By integrating with a supplier, a business partner may be\ninvolved in the early stages of product development or consulting.\nPartnering represents a shift from the customary pressures that larger customers apply on small\nand medium-sized businesses that have previously been dismissed as irrelevant. The partnership\nseeks to transform the adversarial, short-term customer-supplier relationships, focusing on buying,\nprocurement, lower prices, and better delivery, into long-term collaboration with low LAC, few\nsupplies, quick product life cycles, concentration on the core business, and printing with a narrow\nrange. The suppliers brought on board a product launch and introduction by a merger. This deeper\nlevel of integration is required to enhance supply chain performance.\nMost organizations face problems in on-time delivery, whereas integration with suppliers allows\ncompanies to share their order and inventory information with their vendors. It may also be\nsupported that the integration with suppliers contributed to effective communication, information\nsharing, and cooperation with suppliers, all crucial elements in reducing upstream complexity.\nIn fact, supplier integration provided increased responsiveness, flexibility, and time-saving. The\nother advantages of the same are reducing transaction costs through a reduction in manufacturing\ncost and uncertainty. It also improved the operational performance of an enterprise.\nCorrespondingly, the integration of suppliers drastically lowers opportunistic behavior in support\nof mutual visions and cooperationist objectives between the parties. On their part, suppliers can be\nbrought together and share information on orders and inventory with the companies. Another\nmeasure that can help reduce upstream complexity is the integration of suppliers, entailing good\ncommunication, information sharing, and collaboration with the suppliers themselves. This is\naccording to studies by Madzimure et al. (2020) and Zhao et al. (2015).", "word_count": 394, "start_char": 24681, "end_char": 27521}

(2020) and Zhao et al. (2015).\n\nIncreased responsiveness, flexibility, and time saved are some of the benefits of integrating\nsuppliers. It also minimizes transaction costs through reduced uncertainty and slashes production\ncosts, leading to improved operational performance. Most SMEs have continued to grapple with\nissues of on-time delivery. On the other hand, through integration with suppliers, SMEs can\npossibly offer orders and inventory information to suppliers. On the other hand, supplier\nintegration can refer to appropriate communication, information sharing, and collaboration with\nsuppliers, which may reduce the upstream complexity cited by Zhao et al. (2015).\nThe benefits of supplier integration include enhanced responsiveness, flexibility, and timesaving.\nSupplier integration also plays a role in reducing transaction costs by decreasing uncertainties and\nproduction cost-cutting, leading to improved operational performance. In supplier integration,\nshared visions and cooperative goals significantly reduce opportunistic behaviors. It has been\nsuggested that sharing risks and business information-including demand forecasts, inventory level,\nand production planning decisions-and synchronization of business processes-might enhance\npositive organizational performance due to integration within firms. While the latter researches the\nsubstantial and documented relationship between integration and SMEs' performance-as\nconfirmed by Kristal et al. (2020)-it confirms that integration can be transformed into competitive\ncapabilities, contributing to positive SCP. More importantly, this positive relationship between\nsupplier integration and SCP has been confirmed by several studies such as those of Bowersox,\nCloss, & Stank, 2019; Childerhouse & Towill, 2018; Flynn et al., 2020; Frohlich & Westbrook,\n2021; Zhao et al., 2019, in which convincing empirical evidence was found for the relation between\nthe two constructs.\n2.3.2 Data Security in E-Procurement and Organizational Performance\nAccording to Albinkali, 2021, procurement has several key roles to play. These include the\nselection of appropriate ICT tools to facilitate smooth processing in procurement. In vendor and\npartner selection, data security in e-procurement should be a consideration. From the point of view\nof a vertical, EPS supports the needs of modules coming in and those going out and also the interorganizational modules.

Fixed range does not distinguish\nEPS users from non-users because there is little difference between EPS users and non-users. The\nfactors influencing implementation are not equal regarding the explanation of the significance of\nthe acquisition of EPS by the company. According to Soares-Aguiar and Palma dos Reis (2018),\nthe most explanatory factor is experience in computer science and size of company, being the\nhighest standard due to the importance of classifying the introduction of electronic procurement\nsystems. Whereby it observes that IT infrastructure and business-to-business knowledge is very\ncrucial, another important aspect is the disposition of business partners in implementing the\nelectronic acquisition systems.\nIn conclusion, they asserted that professional organizations are more likely to adopt an electronic\npurchasing system than organizations offering production and services. Because of this, a company\nwith more developed IT infrastructures, IT experiences, and B2B knowledge is more interested in\nadopting an electronic acquisition system. In addition, the availability of business partners would\nalso provide the way for introducing electronic procurement systems. Even those competitors that\nhave been doing very well and stand to benefit from the introduction of electronic acquisition\nsystems urged other firms or their rivals to similarly develop electronic acquisition systems.\nHoong & Lin, 2017, in his contribution, highlighted the core contribution of electronic contracting\nin the processes of procurement. The trendsetting development has especially enhanced the\nsecurity and transparency of information.

It encompasses issues regarding research design, study population, techniques\nof sampling, data collection methods, and procedures for data analysis used in this study.\n3.1 Research Design\nThis study adopted a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative methods in\nan attempt to comprehensively explore and analyze the relationship between e-procurement\nadoption and SME performance. In this respect, the study used a descriptive and cross-sectional\nsurvey design to collect data at a particular point in time, thus providing a snapshot of present\nperceptions and current outcomes of e-procurement.\n3.2 Study Population\nThe study population comprised of 250 SMEs within Nakawa Division, Kampala District. These\nwere targeted so that reliable comparisons can be made between SMEs that have adopted and those\nthat have not adopted e-procurement systems. This was deemed an adequate sample size to obtain\nmeaningful variance of opinions from owners, managers, and employees involved in procurement\nand provide a fair analysis of the impact of e-procurement on organizational performance in the\ncontext of Nakawa Division. To this end, the balance of participants in both groups was sought in\na manner that ensures the findings of the study are robust and generalize to the wider SME\npopulation in the area.\n3.3 Sample size Determination\nThe sample size is 152 was determined using the krjce and Morgan table of 1970\n3.4 Sampling Technique\nThe study employed a stratified sampling technique to ensure a representative sample of SMEs in\nNakawa Division. This method divided the population into two strata based on their e-procurement\n\nadoption status. Stratification allowed for proportional representation of adopters and nonadopters, ensuring that the study captured the characteristics of both groups and enabled accurate\ncomparisons of organizational performance. Within each stratum, simple random sampling was\nused to select SMEs for participation, further reducing selection bias and enhancing\ngeneralizability.

Improved procurement efficiency, for\nexample, has a mean score of 4.42 regarding how the e-procurement system has streamlined\nprocesses to use less time and resources to complete any transaction. This efficiency is also in line\nwith what was established by Saastamoinen et al. (2018): that \"fully deploying ICT from need\nidentification to payment throughout a procurement cycle can bring about great operational\nefficiency.\" This is because through the automation of tasks, such as processing orders and invoice\nmanagement, e-procurement frees the resources of an organization to manage more strategic roles\nwithin the organization, hence improving overall performance.\nAlso, transparency, as identified from the literature, is one of the key advantages of e-procurement.\nAccordingly, there is a mean score of 4.32 for increased procurement transparency in this study.\nTransparency is critical to gaining confidence among organizations and suppliers since it provides\nequal access to information for all, thus offering limited opportunities for corruption. Albinkali\n2021 asserts that such e-procurement systems increase transparency in procurement as they\nprovide an auditable trail into all the transactions conducted, thus making tracking the procurement\nactivity easier and holding parties liable for their activities accountable. In agreement with this\nview, it was found that e-procurement improves supplier management and regulatory compliance\nsince an organization can easily monitor the various suppliers about their performances and their\nadherence to the contract terms.\nOther critical impacts that integration has made on organizational performance are cost reductions,\nrated at 3.78, showing a fair level. The score still denotes there is room for improvement, although", "word_count": 375, "start_char": 52284, "end_char": 54955}
{"chunk_id": "DOC0122__00023", "doc_id": "DOC0122", "chunk_index": 23, "text": "ther critical impacts that integration has made on organizational performance are cost reductions,\nrated at 3.78, showing a fair level.T\n\nhe score still denotes there is room for improvement, although\n\ncost savings are apparently there by considering the reduction in manual processing and\nadministrative tasks associated with the traditional method of procurement. Bag et al. (2020)\ncorroborate this view when they argue that e-procurement reduces the manual work involved in\nmaintaining physical copies and space for these, hence reducing operational costs. It also facilitates\ncompetitive bidding and allows transparent selection of suppliers to enable an organization's\nnegotiating power to get better prices and, therefore, reduce costs.\nOrganizational speed means quicker decision-making, and since procurement decisions form a key\ncomponent of these, e-procurement systems go a long way in helping make quicker procurement\ndecisions-as reflected by the high mean score of 4.38. This finding is consistent with Flynn et al.\n(2010), where it is noted that with e-procurement, responses to changes in the market and swings\nin demand are prompt. Managers, while using e-procurement, can reach out for real data and\nanalytics and arrive at decisions quickly, which enhances the responsiveness of the organization\nto external challenges and opportunities.\nOther benefits involve good communication with suppliers, as supported by a mean score of 4.31.\nThe communication channels between the buyers and the sellers on the e-procurement platforms\nare open and continuous; this helps in maintaining good relations with their suppliers. According\nto Saastamoinen et al.2018, this form of communication reduces misconceptions, improves order\naccuracy, and punctual supply of goods and services. This enhances the possibility of great\ncollaboration, and thus, the organization was in a position to adopt a supply chain that is more\nreliable in every aspect, improving overall performances.\nThe impact with the second most responses is reduced human errors, with a mean score of 3.98.\nThe automated nature of procurement, when using e-procurement systems, greatly reduces the\noccurrence of errors associated with manual writing of data or order processing. According to\nChuttur, 2009, \"such automation not only enhances accuracy but also diminishes the need to\ncorrect errors and rework, thereby saving costs and enhancing efficiency.\" Ensuring accurate\nprocurement data as facilitated through integration of e-procurement systems enhances smooth\noperations and better decision-making.\nAlso, it can be observed that improved inventory management within organizations has a mean\nscore of 4.17, hence enhancing the statement.

This is by the literature of So and Sun (2020),\nwho established that through e-procurement, efficient inventory management reduces holding\ncosts and the likelihood of stockouts, therefore enhancing customer satisfaction and improving\nfinancial performance.\nThe other broad area where the e-procurement systems have vast impacts is in supplier\nmanagement, reflected by the mean score of 4.33. Proper supplier management is crucial in\nensuring sustainability in high standards of quality and timing. Zhao et al. (2015) have documented\nthat e-procurement systems have tools for assessing and continuously improving the performance\nof suppliers to ensure that their contractual agreements are upheld. Real-time monitoring of\nsupplier performance would allow an organization to identify problems and undertake corrective\nmeasures to act against them, thus improving the relationship with its suppliers and enhancing\noverall performance in the supply chain.\nCustomer Satisfaction: With an average score of 4.07, customer satisfaction is a significant\noutcome of integrating e-procurement systems. E-procurement systems help in filling customer\norders more effectively and efficiently by enabling goods and services to be bought on time and\nwith great accuracy. Madzimure et al. (2020) indicated that enhanced procurement processes\nrelate directly to high levels of customer satisfaction; organizations can reliably meet the demands\nof their customers. This improved satisfaction also added to the good reputation of an organization\nthrough improved customer loyalty and increased repeat business.\n5.1.2 Effect of data security in e-procurement on organizational performance\nData security in e-procurement systems is what shapes organizational performance. The literature\nby Colander, 2021 projects that electronic procurement systems improve data security with the\nincreased security of online platforms through encryption of secure data. This therefore protects\ndata from unauthorized access but reduces risks related to manual operations on paper.\nInformation obtained from the research supports this view in that data security of e-procurement\nsystems, as perceived, is among the major contributing factors affecting organizational\nperformance. High mean scores from statements that address data security support that it is very\ncritical for protecting procurement data since literature imposes a necessity of secure IT\ninfrastructure.", "word_count": 385, "start_char": 57335, "end_char": 60102}

Proper data security is very important because this facilitates\ndata confidentiality and integrity and hence some element of trust to the suppliers. Similarly,\nSaastamoinen et al. (2018) also emphasize that the integration of ICT in every stage of\nprocurement secured the data. From the research, the extent of trust shows the level of confidence\nthat a stakeholder can have when dealing with secure e-procurement systems. This affirms the\nliterature that robust data security features boost the credibility of an organization.\nThe secure e-procurement systems have ensured better organizational performance by reducing\nincidences of fraud and data breach. With a mean score of 3.84, it shows that while organizations\nacknowledge the protection given by e-procurement systems in preventing breaches of data, there\nis still a way to go. This finding supports Huppert (2018), who states that good data security is\ncritical in the mitigation of risks and improvement of procurement performance. This means that\nthe literature stresses the need for comprehensive security protocols, and the findings indicate\nthat, though improvements have taken place, still further improvements are required.\nResearch has pointed out that data security concerns influence the adoption of e-procurement\nsystems. The factor has a mean score of 4.04. This is in agreement with reviewed literature that\nidentifies perceived security of organizations as one of the drivers of adoption of e-procurement\ntechnologies. According to Johnson, 2019, IT infrastructure and knowledge of B2B are among\nthe critical success factors of an e-procurement implementation. The findings confirm this by\nindicating that data security greatly informs decisions on whether to adopt an e-procurement\nsystem.\nBesides, according to the literature, e-procurement security enhances organizational performance\nas far as assurance of compliance with data protection legislation is concerned. The average\nresponse rate of 3.76 with regard to compliance with legislation on the protection of data show\nthat while the aspect is taken into consideration, there could be difficulties in fully complying\nwith what the law stipulates.

This agrees with what the literature says; strong security\nmeasures were put in place to assist an organization in gaining a top competitive positioning.\nAccording to Huppert, 2018, strategic investment in data security enriches the procurement\nprocedure and\nOrganizational performance. The findings support that organizations are aware of the strategic\nbenefit of investing in data security to enhance competitive advantage and supports the literature's\nview on the role of a secure e-procurement system in attaining superior performance.\nAlso, there is support for the notion that investment in data security increases confidence from\nsuppliers. But, there is evidence from the mean score of 2.53 to indicate that this could be a lesser\npriority in practice. While the literature insists on the role that data security plays in creating a\ntrusting and confident supplier, it therefore becomes contrasting to see just how little emphasis is\nplaced on this fact in this study. In this respect, Huppert (2018) and Kishor et al. (2019) find this\nas a suggestion that, while the benefits of secure e-procurement systems, according to the\nliterature review, are useful to create better ties with suppliers, there are still varying levels of\nimpact given specific organizational contexts or practices.\nThese results reflect the role of data security in promoting procurement efficiency, as it was found\nthat organizations with secure e-procurement systems experience quickened decision-making and\ndecreased procurement costs. This also supports the literature which shows that secure systems\npromote efficient procurement processes that have positive impacts on organizational\nperformance. It is indicated by the mean scores that organizations take secure e-procurement\nsystems to be conducive to operational efficiency. Thus, it supports the assertions made in the\nliterature regarding the benefits of integrated secure technologies in procurement.\nIt was indicated from the results that secure e-procurement systems offer a better management of\nsensitive procurement data; hence, there is assurance to confidentiality and there are no data\nbreaches.

The\nplacement of emphasis on the security of data among the findings underlines its role in ensuring\nthat procurement processes are both efficient and secure.\n5.1.3 Supplier Readiness in e-procurement on organizational performance\nSupplier readiness has been observed to be key in realizing successful implementation of an eprocurement system and has been contributing a lot to organizational performance. The results\nindicate that for supplier readiness, the mean score is 4.54 with a relatively low standard deviation\nof 0.915, which identifies it as an important determinant factor for effectiveness in the eprocurement system. It therefore means that the organizations consider readiness of suppliers to\nbe vital for the effective working of e-procurement initiatives, which hence comes along with the\nliterature that emphasizes how the ability of prepared suppliers eases the processes involved in eprocurement.\nThese findings are supported by the literature reviewed in Chapter 2, where the importance of\nreadiness has been highlighted to include a supplier's technological capabilities, operational\nstructures, and adherence to the legal framework. In this regard, Flynn et al. (2010) and Zhao et\nal. (2015) note that a supplier's effective integration and readiness enhance the firm's performance\nin terms of its operational capabilities at lower transaction costs, hence foster efficiency in the\nsupply chains. The findings mirror these assertions, as the high means for supplier readiness are\nindicative of a positive influence on organizational performance.\nIn particular, the literature identifies that supplier readiness minimizes procurement errors and\npromotes supply chain performance through enhanced communication, information sharing, and\ncollaboration (Madzimure et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2015). This agrees with findings that show\nhigh levels of supplier readiness relate to superior organizational performances, insinuating that\norganizations which invest time in preparing their suppliers for e-procurement systems experience\nfewer issues and greater efficiencies in their procurement processes.\nIt is further backed by the theoretical boundary condition of the Technology Acceptance Model\nor TAM, that states perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use influence technology adoption\nin organizations. In this regard, Davis (1989) and Venkatesh et al. (2003) assert that when\nsuppliers are indeed prepared to receive this and perceive an e-procurement system as useful and", "word_count": 418, "start_char": 64779, "end_char": 67740}

(2003) assert that when\nsuppliers are indeed prepared to receive this and perceive an e-procurement system as useful and\n\neasy to use, their integration with such a system is bound to improve organizational performance\nas a whole. It has also been revealed that better procurement outcomes are positively related to\nthe state of readiness of the suppliers.\nThe literature review, therefore, highlights that the integration of suppliers can result in massive\nreturns in terms of responsiveness, flexibility, and reduced transaction cost. In fact, Madzimure\net al. (2020) and Yu et al. (2014) contend that the better the level of readiness among suppliers,\nthe better the realization of these benefits, consequently improving performance. Thus, it follows\nlogically that proper integration of suppliers holds the key to ensuring procurement at optimized\nlevels and, importantly, yields better operational outcomes.\nIn addition, supplier readiness can reduce problems related to on-time delivery and upstream\ncomplexity faced by SMEs. Zhao et al. (2015) asserted that the relatively high mean score of\nsupplier readiness means that the respondents have recognized those challenges and are therefore\ntaking corrective measures to ensure that their suppliers are ready to engage in e-procurement.\nThe proactive approach in this regard is consistent with what the literature recommends on the\nnecessity of supplier readiness for overcoming procurement challenges.\n5.2 Conclusions\nThese findings underline the fact that supplier readiness significantly contributes to the eprocurement system success and further to organizational performance. Higher levels of readiness\nare combined with positive results in procurement outcomes, such as enhancing efficiency,\nreducing errors, and improving supply chain performance. This leads to the final conclusion,\nwhich agrees with the literature that emphasizes that prepared suppliers further ensured smoother\ne-procurement processes and higher operational outcomes. These benefits are more likely to be\nachieved by organizations which invest in training their suppliers to be ready for an e-procurement\nsystem, further stating how vital it is that suppliers be prepared to complement procurement\npractices.\nTAM helps in the development of a useful framework regarding the impact of supplier readiness\non the adoption of e-procurement. Therefore, through TAM, one identifies that perceived\nusefulness and perceived ease of use are regarded as factors that considerably influence\ntechnology adoption.

Thus, for\neffective performance, the engagements towards the system should be highly improved. This is,\nin turn, supported by the theoretical perspective that high levels of readiness on the part of\nsuppliers resulted in more effective and efficient procurement processes, thereby reinforcing a\nfocus upon supplier preparedness as a source of enhanced outcomes from e-procurement.\nHence, incorporating supplier readiness into e-procurement systems might just be the key to\norganizational success. The fact that the results are aligned with the literature reviewed suggests\nthat supplier readiness contributes to different aspects of procurement-from reduced transaction\ncosts to responsiveness and flexibility. This addresses the strategic relevance of considering\nsupplier readiness during e-procurement implementation, making sure that organizations can fully\nexploit the benefits of digital procurement systems and performance objectives.\n5.3 Recommendations\nThe findings suggest that organizations consider increasing the readiness of suppliers as an integral\npart of the implementation of e-procurement. Accordingly, training and technological support\nhelped suppliers be very helpful in their states of preparedness toward effective engagement with\nan e-procurement system. This process, if effective, and offered organizations the best opportunity\nto achieve procurement process optimization and organizational performance improvement.\nOrganizations should also try to improve communication with and the collaboration of their\nsuppliers. By building good, trusting partnerships that make sharing of information easy,\ncompanies can achieve better integration with their suppliers and reduce a number of the\ncomplexities of procurement. This may lead to smoother transactions and better alignment between\nsuppliers and procurement goals.\nThese findings suggest that an evaluation be made of the organizations for technological gaps and\nthe addressing of such gaps to ensure the readiness of suppliers. In this light, it is important to\nmake sure that suppliers are given sufficient IT infrastructure and capabilities to make integration\ninto e-procurement systems smooth and facile, so as not to cause any disruption to the procurement\nprocess.\nMoreover, every organization should review how it can enhance the effectiveness of its eprocurement systems through mechanisms for continuous feedback.

It\ncould enhance the adoption rate and overall effectiveness of such systems.\nStrategic development of complete support structures for suppliers, from very clear guidelines to\nresources on system usage, is necessary in ways that helped actualize benefits from e-procurement.\nThrough this, with ongoing support and prompt resolutions of issues, suppliers were able to\nmaintain engagement and, in turn, ensure successful implementation of the e-procurement system.\nOrganizations should continue being informed about the most recent trends and developments in\ne-procurement.
