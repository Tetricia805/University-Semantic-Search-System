It interferes with teenagers' typical\ntransition into adulthood, which frequently results in financial difficulties,\npsychological suffering, and social disapproval. Families with teenager moms may\nexperience significant instability, especially in rural areas with socioeconomic\ndifficulties like Bubaare Sub-County, Rubanda District. With an emphasis on the\ncauses, effects, and coping mechanisms of impacted families, this study sought to\nevaluate the effect of teenage pregnancy on family stability.\n1.2 Background of the Study\n1.2.1 Historical Background\nWith historical roots ingrained in gendered, cultural, and economic dynamics,\nteenage pregnancy has long been acknowledged as a socioeconomic and public\nhealth concern. The phenomenon of teenager childbirth has affected marginalized\npeople worldwide, especially in low- and middle-income nations. International\nagencies like the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the World Health\nOrganization (WHO) have reported increasing rates of teenage pregnancies\nthroughout the years, particularly in regions with poor access to economic, medical,\nand educational possibilities (UNFPA, 2021).\nFamily stability has been greatly impacted by teenage pregnancy in South America,\nwhich is influenced by poverty, cultural norms, and restricted educational\nopportunities (Del Mastro, 2023).

Increasing urbanization and\neconomic disparity during the 20th century contributed to a rise in teenager\npregnancies, particularly in underprivileged areas. These pregnancies frequently\ncaused unstable family structures by interfering with economic and educational\nprospects. Issues like poverty, gender inequity, and lax enforcement of policies\ncontinue to exist despite contemporary attempts to implement reproductive health\ninitiatives (Smith & Sinkford, 2022). Teenage pregnancy therefore keeps families\nunder stress by sustaining cycles of dependency and decreased social mobility.\nHistorically, teenage pregnancy has been more common in areas where traditional\ncustoms and gender norms, like early marriage and little female autonomy, are\ndeeply ingrained. These customs have endured down the years in Sub-Saharan\nAfrica, helping to normalize early childbearing. UNICEF (2020) asserts that cultural\nnorms frequently govern girls' early motherhood, considering it a rite of passage\nrather than a risk factor for socioeconomic instability.\nIn order to decrease teenager pregnancies by increasing access to reproductive\nhealth care and education, national governments and development partners have\nlaunched a number of campaigns and policy initiatives over time. Nevertheless, the\nissue persists despite decades of work. According to the World Health Organization\n(2020), this is caused by structural deficiencies in the provision of health services,\ngender-sensitive education, and youth empowerment initiatives, particularly in rural\nregions.", "word_count": 255, "start_char": 12551, "end_char": 14470}

In the past, extended families supported early marriage and\nchildbearing, which were widespread and socially acceptable. However, these\nsystems have deteriorated due to urbanization and modernization, which has put\nmore strain on young moms (Haq, 2024). Teenage pregnancies increased in the postcolonial era due in part to inadequate access to reproductive health services and\neducation. This has frequently resulted in poor family relationships, financial\ndifficulty, and school dropouts. Teenage pregnancy still causes family instability in\nspite of recent measures, particularly in low-income and rural areas.\nIn East African countries, Cultural customs like early marriage and restricted female\nautonomy have long been linked to teenager pregnancy (Nhampoca & Maritz, 2024).\nIn the past, it was socially acceptable and frequently encouraged by extended\nfamilies for girls to marry young and have children early. However, formal education\ngained relevance as a result of colonial influence and subsequent industrialization,\nand early pregnancies began to be perceived as a disruption to the development of\nthe individual and the family. Teenage pregnancies, which frequently occurred\noutside of marriage, increased in the late 20th century due to urban migration and\npoverty, leaving families struggling financially and leaving them with a single mother\n(Trask, 2022). The problem was made worse by inadequate health services and\nrestricted access to reproductive education.\nIn Uganda, although population control and education programs have changed over\ntime, the rate of teenage pregnancies has not been completely reduced.

Teenage pregnancy is still a significant problem\nin Bubaare Sub-county, Rubanda District, where poverty and traditional beliefs are\nstill prevalent.\n1.2.2 Theoretical Background\nThe Ecological Systems Theory (Bronfenbrenner, 1979) and the Strain Theory\n(Merton, 1938) served as the study's guiding theories.\nEcological Systems Theory\nAccording to Bronfenbrenner's Ecological Systems Theory, which was developed in\n1979, human development is impacted by many environmental system levels that\ninteract with a person's biological potential to shape experiences and behavior\n(Bronfenbrenner, 1979). The microsystem, mesosystem, exosystem, macrosystem,\nand chronosystem are the five interconnected systems described in the theory.\nThrough their connections with peers, family, the community, and societal\ninstitutions, these systems together impact a person's development (Neal & Neal,\n2019).\nHuman development takes place inside nested environmental structures, and\ninteractions between these systems continuously influence an individual's\ndevelopment, according to the Ecological Systems Theory's underlying presumptions.\nAnother presumption is that people are impacted by their immediate and extended\ncontexts rather than developing independently. Additionally, according to the idea,", "word_count": 257, "start_char": 16028, "end_char": 17932}

How a teenager woman handles her pregnancy may be influenced by\nthe presence or absence of familial support at the microsystem level. The teenager's\ncapacity to pursue further education or seek out support networks is influenced by\nthe mesosystem, which encompasses interactions between the home, school, and\ncommunity. How well families are able to manage the financial strains of a young\npregnancy depends on the exosystem, which includes factors like parental\nemployment status and local economic stability (Bronfenbrenner, 2005).\nAt the macrosystem level, family reactions and the general stability of the home are\ninfluenced by cultural and societal conventions surrounding early pregnancy, gender\nroles, and marriage. Teenage pregnancy trends and family adaptability are\ninfluenced by historical and life transitions, such as changes in socioeconomic\nconditions or policy regarding teenager reproductive health (Darling, 2020).

Merton created Merton's Strain Theory in 1938. It offers a\nframework for comprehending how social factors influence abnormal behavior.\nAccording to the notion, people are driven to pursue alternative paths, which may\ninvolve risky or criminal activities, by social pressures and a lack of access to legal\nways to succeed (Agnew, 2019). Teenage pregnancy and early sexual engagement\nare two such outcomes, especially for teenagers living in low-income environments.\nThe foundation of Merton's Strain Theory is the idea that while society sets cultural\nobjectives like stability and financial success, not everyone has equal access to legal\nways to fulfill these ambitions. Because of the stress and anomie caused by this\ndiscrepancy, some people turn to other means of achieving success (Agnew, 2019).\nAccording to Merton, there are five ways that people can adjust to stress:\nconformity, which involves following social norms and goals; innovation, which\ninvolves pursuing success through illegal means; ritualism, which involves eschewing\nsocial norms but continuing to follow customs; retreatism, which involves rejecting\nboth social norms and means; and rebellion, which involves trying to replace the\ncurrent social structures with new ones (Passas & Agnew, 2020). Strain theory is a\nuseful paradigm for examining socioeconomic difficulties and deviance because of\nthese adaptations, which also explain differences in deviant conduct and social\nreactions to inequality.\nIn the context of teenage pregnancy, according to Merton's Strain Theory, societal\nexpectations, restricted educational possibilities, and financial difficulties can cause\nstress in teenagers, especially in low-income neighborhoods (Bunting et al., 2020;\nMadkour et al., 2021). Some young females may regard early partnerships and\npregnancy as alternate ways to obtain stability, social approval, or financial support", "word_count": 331, "start_char": 19107, "end_char": 21431}

This is in line with the \"innovation\" form of adaptation, in which\npeople use non-traditional methods to accomplish social objectives. Media impacts\nmay also have an impact on how teenagers view early motherhood (Coyne et al.,\n2020).\nTeenage pregnancy disrupts family stability in Bubaare Sub-County due to restricted\nprospects and economic hardship, as explained by Merton's Strain Theory. Teenagers\nare pushed toward early parenthood by poverty and a lack of support. These effects\ncan be lessened with focused interventions in health, work, and education.\n1.2.3 Conceptual Background\nPregnancy in a young lady between the ages of 10 and 19 is referred to as teenage\npregnancy. This study views teenager pregnancy as a multifaceted occurrence\nhaving socioeconomic and psychological ramifications, in addition to being a\nreproductive health concern. The main ideas being reviewed are the interconnected\nconsequences of teenage pregnancy, such as early sexual debut, unplanned\npregnancy, school dropout, and family instability.\nIn this context, the ability of a family to preserve functional relationships, emotional\nsupport networks, and economic sustainability is referred to as family stability.\nParticularly in low-resource environments like Rubanda District, teenage pregnancy\nupsets this stability by bringing with it unanticipated caregiving responsibilities,\nfinancial strain, and social stigma. After a teenager pregnancy, families frequently\nface emotional strain, intergenerational conflict, and disintegration (Banke-Thomas\net al., 2020).", "word_count": 284, "start_char": 21014, "end_char": 23081}

Teenagers in rural areas usually don't receive\nthorough sexuality education, which leads to poor sexual behavior decisions. These\nyouths are more likely to have unprotected intercourse and become pregnant\nunintentionally if they are not given the right information and support (Habumugisha\net al., 2021).\nLast but not least, the idea of social support networks is crucial to reducing the\nharmful effects of teenage pregnancy. Schools, medical facilities, peer groups,\nplaces of worship, and non-governmental organizations are some examples of these\nsystems. Teenager moms' ability to pursue further education, obtain healthcare, or\nreintegrate into their communities is greatly impacted by the availability and\naccessibility of such services.\n1.2.4 Contextual Background\nTeenager pregnancy is still a significant developmental obstacle in Uganda.\nAccording to UBOS (2022), 25% of Ugandan girls between the ages of 15 and 19 are\neither pregnant or have previously given birth. Due to high rates of poverty, limited\naccess to reproductive health services, and enduring cultural norms that encourage\nearly marriage and childbirth, rural districts like those in Western Uganda are\ndisproportionately impacted.\nBubaare Sub-County in Rubanda District is a prime example of this nationwide\npattern.

These haven't, however,\nresulted in appreciable drops in teenager pregnancies, indicating that more serious\nstructural problems may be at work. According to Muwonge et al. (2020), these\ninclude pervasive poverty, a dearth of economic prospects for young people, and lax\nimplementation of child protection legislation.\nThere is an urgent need to investigate the wider societal and familial ramifications\nof teenage pregnancy, as it continues to put strain on family structures in Rubanda\nDistrict. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of teenage pregnancy\non family stability in Bubaare Sub-County and to provide long-term, locally relevant\nsolutions.\n1.3 Problem Statement\nTeenage pregnancy is a global public health and socio-economic concern,\nparticularly in low- and middle-income countries where teenager girls face high\nlevels of vulnerability. According to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA,\n2021), approximately 16 million girls aged 15–19 years give birth annually, with Sub-\nSaharan Africa recording the highest rates due to poverty, cultural norms, early\nmarriages, and inadequate access to reproductive health services.

In Uganda, the Uganda\nBureau of Statistics (UBOS, 2022) indicates that 25% of teenage girls have begun\nchildbearing, a figure that climbs to 27% in the Western Region, highlighting the\nheightened vulnerability of rural communities.\nIn Rubanda District, and more specifically in Bubaare Sub-County, teenage\npregnancy has become a pressing issue that threatens family stability and community\ndevelopment. The problem predominantly affects girls aged 13–19 years from\nimpoverished rural households with limited access to formal education and\nreproductive health services. Consequences include school dropout, early marriages,\neconomic dependence, psychological distress, and increased strain on extended\nfamily systems. Despite various government and NGO-led interventions such as\nreproductive health education and youth-friendly services, teenage pregnancy rates\nin rural areas like Bubaare remain persistently high. This suggests gaps in the\neffectiveness, accessibility, or cultural sensitivity of existing strategies. The\nproblem is further influenced by the roles and attitudes of parents, educators,\nreligious leaders, and healthcare providers. If unaddressed, teenage pregnancy will\ncontinue to reinforce cycles of poverty, gender inequality, and disrupted family\nsystems.

However, these causes do not\noperate in isolation; they are shaped and mediated by socioeconomic, cultural, and\npolicy factors. For instance, poverty and low educational attainment may increase\nvulnerability to early pregnancy, while cultural norms such as the acceptance of\nearly marriages or stigmatization of contraceptive use further exacerbate the issue.\nAdditionally, weak policy enforcement on reproductive health education and\ninadequate youth-friendly health services can limit preventive measures.

Teenager pregnancy has effects on families, communities, and the\nadvancement of the country in addition to the individual. This chapter reviews\nexisting literature related to teenage pregnancy and its impact on family stability in\nBubaare\nSub-County,\nRubanda\nDistrict.\nThe review\nincludes\ntheoretical\nperspectives, key conceptual discussions, empirical evidence on the causes and\neffects of teenage pregnancy on family stability, coping strategies employed by\nfamilies, research gaps, and a conclusion.\n2.2 Theoretical Review\nThe Ecological Systems Theory (Bronfenbrenner, 1979) and the Strain Theory\n(Merton, 1938) served as the study's guiding theories.\n2.2.1 Ecological Systems Theory\nAccording to Bronfenbrenner's Ecological Systems Theory, which was developed in\n1979, human development is impacted by many environmental system levels that\ninteract with a person's biological potential to shape experiences and behavior\n\n(Bronfenbrenner, 1979). The microsystem, mesosystem, exosystem, macrosystem,\nand chronosystem are the five interconnected systems described in the theory.\nThrough their connections with peers, family, the community, and societal\ninstitutions, these systems together impact a person's development (Neal & Neal,\n2019).\nThe Ecological Systems Theory is predicated on the notion that human development\ntakes place inside nested environmental structures and that interactions among\nthese systems continuously influence an individual's development. Individuals are\nassumed to be influenced by their immediate and extended environments rather\nthan developing in a vacuum. The theory also makes the assumption that\ndevelopment is dynamic, which means that changes over time like adjustments in\nfamily stability or socioeconomic standing can have a significant impact on a person's\nlife outcomes (Tudge, 2019).\nThis hypothesis explains how various environmental factors contribute to early\npregnancies and their subsequent consequences on families, which is closely related\nto the study on the influence of teenage pregnancy on family stability in Bubaare\nSub-County. How a teenager woman handles her pregnancy may be influenced by\nthe presence or absence of familial support at the microsystem level. The teenager's\ncapacity to pursue further education or seek out support networks is influenced by\nthe mesosystem, which encompasses interactions between the home, school, and\ncommunity. How well families are able to manage the financial strains of a young\npregnancy depends on the exosystem, which includes factors like parental\nemployment status and local economic stability (Bronfenbrenner, 2005).", "word_count": 434, "start_char": 34862, "end_char": 37993}

Teenage pregnancy trends and family adaptability are\ninfluenced by historical and life transitions, such as changes in socioeconomic\nconditions or policy regarding teenager reproductive health (Darling, 2020). The\nstudy may thoroughly evaluate the several elements influencing teenager pregnancy\nand how they interact to influence family stability in Bubaare Sub-County by using\nthis framework.\n2.2.2 Strain Theory\nOverview Sociologist Robert K. Merton created Merton's Strain Theory in 1938. It\noffers a framework for comprehending how social factors influence abnormal\nbehavior. According to the notion, people are driven to pursue alternative paths,\nwhich may involve risky or criminal activities, by social pressures and a lack of access\nto legal ways to succeed (Agnew, 2019). Teenage pregnancy and early sexual\nengagement are two such outcomes, especially for teenagers living in low-income\nenvironments.\nThe foundation of Merton's Strain Theory is the idea that while society sets cultural\nobjectives like stability and financial success, not everyone has equal access to legal\nways to fulfill these ambitions. Because of the stress and anomie caused by this\ndiscrepancy, some people turn to other means of achieving success (Agnew, 2019).\nAccording to Merton, there are five ways that people can adjust to stress:\nconformity, which involves following social norms and goals; innovation, which\ninvolves pursuing success through illegal means; ritualism, which involves eschewing\nsocial norms but continuing to follow customs; retreatism, which involves rejecting", "word_count": 310, "start_char": 37594, "end_char": 39754}

Strain Theory is a\nuseful framework for examining socioeconomic difficulties and deviance because of\nthese adaptations, which also explain differences in deviant conduct and social\nreactions to inequality.\nAccording to Merton's Strain Theory, cultural expectations, restricted educational\nprospects, and financial difficulty may cause stress in teenagers, especially in lowincome communities, when it comes to teen pregnancy (Bunting et al., 2020;\nMadkour et al., 2021). Some young females may regard early partnerships and\npregnancy as alternate ways to obtain stability, social approval, or financial support\nwhen traditional alternatives like school and job advancement appear unachievable\n(Harden, 2019). This is in line with the \"innovation\" form of adaptation, in which\npeople use non-traditional methods to accomplish social objectives. Media impacts\nmay also have an impact on how teenagers view early motherhood (Coyne et al.,\n2020). Teenage pregnancy disrupts family stability in Bubaare Sub-County due to\nrestricted prospects and economic hardship, as explained by Merton's Strain Theory.\nTeenagers are pushed toward early parenthood by poverty and a lack of support.\nThese consequences can be lessened by focused interventions in the fields of health,\nwork, and education.\n2.3 Empirical Review\n2.3.1 Causes of Teenage Pregnancy among Teenagers\nPoverty and financial difficulty are major contributors to teenager pregnancy.\nTeenager girls are frequently forced to participate in transactional sex, when they\ntrade sexual favors for cash, food, or essentials due to economic insecurity (UNFPA,", "word_count": 295, "start_char": 39433, "end_char": 41504}

Many teenage females in rural areas like Bubare Sub-County are compelled\nto seek financial support through early marriages or partnerships with older men due\nto a lack of work options and household poverty. Although there is ample evidence\nlinking poverty to preterm birth, little research has examined the direct impact of\nsuch economic vulnerabilities on family stability, especially in rural Ugandan\ncommunities. By investigating how teenager pregnancies brought on by poverty\naffect parental relationships, financial resources, and family responsibilities in\nBubare Sub-County, this study aims to close that gap.\nThe absence of access to thorough sexual and reproductive health education is\nanother important contributing factor. Many teenagers still don't know enough about\nSTIs, contraception, and the long-term effects of getting pregnant too young.\nUnwanted pregnancies and unprotected sex are made more likely by this ignorance\n(Guttmacher Institute, 2021). Though previous research has emphasized this\neducational disparity, few have looked at the ways in which this ignorance impacts\nthe teenager girl as well as the larger family, including the stress, increasing\ndependency, and social stigma it causes.\nTeenage pregnancy is also greatly aided by cultural and religious conventions. As a\nmeans of maintaining family honor, ancestry, and traditional beliefs, early marriage\nand childbearing are frequently encouraged in a number of African societies,\nincluding Uganda (Mugisha & Mugisa, 2021). Early sexual activity and childbearing\nare encouraged by cultural views that define a woman's worth via motherhood,\nwhich can limit girls' access to education and employment prospects.

Teenagers\nfrequently copy the actions of their friends or celebrities, particularly when those\nactions are presented as contemporary or socially acceptable (Kalule & Ochen,\n2019). Teenagers may engage in dangerous sexual conduct to fit in due to peer\npressure, and media outlets usually glorify sexual relationships without emphasizing\nthe negative effects. However, the impact of peer and media-driven pregnancies on\nhome stability whether through interrupted education, strained parent-child\nrelationships, or financial strains is not adequately examined in the literature\ncurrently in publication.\nAnother important factor is family background, especially dysfunctional family\nsettings. Teenagers from households where there is parental abuse, neglect, or\nabsence frequently don't receive the right kind of emotional support and direction\n(Ninsiima et al., 2020). These teenagers are more likely to engage in early sexual\nactivity and become pregnant if they go to other sources for affection or financial\nsupport. Although the overall literature acknowledges these dynamics, local\nresearch on the ways in which teenager pregnancies from broken households lead to\nlong-term instability within extended families particularly in rural communities like\nBubare Sub-County are lacking.\nAdditionally, one underappreciated factor contributing to teenager pregnancy is the\nlack of access to youth-friendly health services.

Teenager moms generally lack the financial means to maintain themselves\nand their children, and they are frequently still reliant on their caretakers. As a\nresult, families are left to pay for childcare, food, clothing, and medical care. This\nadditional financial strain might further impoverish households in resourceconstrained areas like Bubare Sub-County, where poverty rates are already high.\nTeenage pregnancy raises household expenses, which reduces a family's capacity to\nfund the welfare and education of other children (UNICEF, 2021). However, there is\na lack of localized research regarding how such economic strain directly impacts\nrural households in southwestern Uganda, as the majority of studies on this topic\nconcentrate on national or urban settings.\nEmotional and Psychological Distress\nAccording to a recent study, families with teenage moms frequently face more\nemotional and psychological difficulties.

The\nstigmatization that comes from the larger community makes these emotional\ndifficulties even worse. Despite these facts, not much research has looked at how\nemotional turmoil like this affects parenting styles and family cohesion in rural\nUganda. Additionally, by describing the emotional strain and psychological stress\nthat teenager pregnancy causes in families in Bubare Sub-County, the\naforementioned study highlights a gap.\nDisruption of Family Roles and Responsibilities\nTeenager pregnancies frequently result in changes to family dynamics, including\nadjustments to domestic duties and caregiving roles. Siblings may be neglected or\nforced to help with child-rearing responsibilities, while parents may end up coparenting their grandkids. Family members may experience conflict, stress, and\nresentment as a result of these unexpected role adjustments (Nabukalu, Lwanga, &\nTumwine, 2019). Research and policy responses frequently fail to systematically\ncapture such disturbances. However, there is a research gap because the study by\nNabukalu, Lwanga, and Tumwine (2019) does not demonstrate how role\nreassignments in the family unit, brought on by teenager pregnancy, affect longterm household harmony and stability in Bubare Sub-County.\nEducational Disruption and Intergenerational Poverty\nIn Uganda, one of the main reasons why females drop out of school is teenage\npregnancy.

This study will look at how early pregnancy-related school dropouts\nimpact the socioeconomic trajectory of families in Bubare Sub-County.\nLimited Social Support Systems\nThe lack or insufficiency of official and informal support networks for impacted\nfamilies is another underappreciated effect of teenage pregnancy. While some nongovernmental organizations offer interventions in metropolitan areas, these services\nare frequently absent in rural areas. Without sufficient psychosocial or financial\nsupport, families are forced to deal with the complicated realities of teenage\npregnancy (Gahongayire et al., 2022).

Some families actively encourage their teenage daughters\nto pursue higher education in spite of the obstacles. To increase their chances of\nlanding a steady job after giving birth, they might advise them to go back to school\nor seek vocational training. In order to give the young mother greater chances for\nindependence and a more stable future, these initiatives are frequently crucial\n(Nalwoga & Namuli, 2021).\nMany families look for alternate sources of income in order to deal with the financial\ndifficulties associated with teenager pregnancy. This could entail launching small\nenterprises, accepting more work, or participating in locally based revenuegenerating endeavors. These initiatives assist the family in covering the higher\nexpenses of healthcare and childcare that come with being a teenage mother\n(Atuhaire et al., 2021).\nIn order to cope with the psychological and emotional effects of teenage pregnancy,\nsome families look for professional therapy or psychosocial assistance.

The study\nused a systematic approach to gather and analyze data, ensuring reliability and\nvalidity in addressing the research objectives.\n3.1 Study Area\nThe study was carried out in the Western Region of Uganda's Bubaare Sub-County,\nwhich is part of the Rubanda District. Teenage pregnancy is a major worry in\nBubaare, a rural location where the majority of the population works in agriculture.\nThe sub-county's numerous elementary and secondary schools, medical institutions,\nand community centers served as crucial sources of data for our investigation. Given\nthat the district has a higher rate of teenage pregnancies than the national norm,\nBubaare's geographic and socioeconomic features make it a perfect place to\ninvestigate how teenager pregnancy affects family stability.\n3.2 Research Approach\nIn order to investigate the lived experiences of families impacted by teenager\npregnancy, the study used a qualitative research methodology. Understanding the\nchallenges and frequently arbitrary social phenomena surrounding teenager\npregnancy and its effects on family relations was best accomplished through a\nqualitative method. This made it possible to thoroughly examine how personal\nexperiences, viewpoints, and social elements affect family stability.", "word_count": 394, "start_char": 51878, "end_char": 54633}

In the context of Bubaare Sub-\nCounty, this approach was used because it allowed the researcher to characterize\nand analyze the traits and impacts of teenage pregnancy on family structures. A\nthorough grasp of the difficulties and coping strategies that local families deal with\nas a result of teenage pregnancy was made possible via descriptive study.\n3.4 Research Procedure\nThe research procedure begun with a review of existing literature to understand the\nfactors influencing teenage pregnancy and its implications for family stability.\nFollowing this, the researcher identified and engaged relevant stakeholders such as\nlocal leaders, health workers, teachers, and parents of teenage mothers to seek\npermission and facilitate collaboration for data collection. Primary data was then\ncollected through field visits to households, community leaders, and institutions.\nInformed consent was obtained from all participants prior to data collection.\n3.5 Target Population\nThe target population of 65 people for the study included families with teenage\nmothers in Bubaare Sub-County, along with community leaders, teachers, and health\nworkers. Specifically, the study focused on teenage mothers aged 13-19 years who\nhad at least one child, as well as their family members, including parents, guardians,\nand siblings.

This target population was\nselected because they were directly affected by teenage pregnancy and provided\nvaluable insights into its social, economic, and psychological impact on family\nstability.\n3.6 Sample size determination\nUsing Slovin's formula, the researcher calculated the proper sample size because the\ntotal population is 65 people. When working with a known population and a\npredetermined margin of error, Slovin's formula was used to determine a\nrepresentative sample size. Using a 95% confidence level and a 5% margin of error\nto account for any non-responses, the sample size was determined by estimating the\nprevalence of poverty among the semi-illiterate population in comparable\nsituations.

The primary data was collected using two key approaches: indepth interviews and focus group discussions (FGDs).\nIn-depth Interviews\nA purposively selected sample of key informants, including teachers, community\nleaders, health professionals, parents or guardians of young mothers, and teenage\nmothers themselves, participated in semi-structured in-depth interviews. The semistructured style made it possible to probe individual experiences in a flexible way\nwhile staying focused on the goals of the study. Teenage moms' personal stories,\nthe events leading up to pregnancy, and the support or lack thereof from family\nmembers were all covered in the interviews. Teenage pregnancy's emotional,\nfinancial, and social impacts on the family were questioned of parents and\nguardians. Teachers and health workers provided perspectives on the broader\nimplications for education and health, while community leaders shared insights into\ncommunity perceptions and responses. All interviews were conducted in a private\nand confidential setting to ensure participants feel safe and are able to speak freely.\nInterviews were recorded (with consent) and transcribed for thematic analysis.\n\nFocus Group Discussions (FGDs)\nFocus group discussions were held with parents, community leaders, and local\nopinion leaders to gain a broader understanding of the community’s attitudes,\ncultural beliefs, and social dynamics that influence teenage pregnancy and family\nstability. Each FGD consisted of 6–10 participants, and sessions were facilitated using\na discussion guide aligned with the study objectives. Discussions explored community\nnorms surrounding early sexual activity and marriage, stigma associated with\nteenage pregnancy, and support systems available for affected families. FGDs were\nconducted in locations that were convenient and accessible to participants, and\neach session was audio recorded (with consent) and later transcribed and analyzed\nto identify recurring themes and group-level insights.", "word_count": 370, "start_char": 58152, "end_char": 60810}

To perform one-on-one in-depth interviews\nwith parents, teachers, community leaders, health professionals, and teenager\nmoms, interview guides were created. Open-ended questions in these guidelines\ngave participants the opportunity to elaborate on their viewpoints, experiences, and\nopinions. The study sought to gather a broad variety of contextual and personal\ncharacteristics that might affect teenager pregnancy and its effects on family\nstability by employing open-ended questionnaires.\nFurthermore, guides for focus group discussions (FGDs) with parents and community\nleaders were created. The social, economic, and psychological effects of teenage\npregnancy on family relations were the main topics of these talks, which gave\nparticipants a chance to reflect and talk with one another. Last but not least, during\nfield visits, an observation checklist was utilized to record body language, nonverbal\nclues, and other contextual information that could improve comprehension of the\ncircumstance and aid in data triangulation.", "word_count": 261, "start_char": 60404, "end_char": 62315}

Document analysis was carried out using records and reports from health and\neducational institutions to examine institutional policies, available resources, and\nservices for teenage mothers, as well as the challenges these institutions face in\naddressing teenage pregnancy. Key documents to be reviewed included the Uganda\nDemographic and Health Survey (UDHS) 2022, which highlights the national\nprevalence and health implications of teenage pregnancy, and the Ministry of\nEducation and Sports Annual Performance Report (2023), which addresses its impact\non school attendance and dropout rates. Additionally, policy documents such as the\nNational Teenager Health Policy (2019) and the Revised Guidelines for the\nPrevention and Management of Teenage Pregnancy in School Settings (MoES, 2020)\nwill be analyzed to understand institutional response mechanisms. By examining\nthese sources alongside health service reports and school records, the study built a\ncomprehensive understanding of the external factors influencing teenage pregnancy\nand its effects on family stability. The integration of primary data from fieldwork\nwith secondary data from institutional sources enabled a more holistic and wellrounded analysis of the issue.\n3.10 Data Analysis\nSince this is a qualitative study, thematic analysis was used to analyse data.\nThematic analysis is a widely used method in qualitative research for identifying,\nanalyzing, and interpreting patterns of meaning (Braun & Clarke, 2006). This\napproach allowed the researcher to examine interview transcripts and field notes to\nuncover recurring themes related to the impact of teenage pregnancy on family", "word_count": 286, "start_char": 62079, "end_char": 64092}

An analysis plan was developed incorporating direct quotations and\nfrequently occurring concepts to ensure a rich interpretation of the findings.\nAccording to Noel et al. (2017), thematic analysis is valued for its clarity and ease\nof use, making it appropriate for this study. This method helped uncover\ninstitutional, social, and economic dynamics influencing how teenage pregnancy\naffects family cohesion, roles, and support systems in Bubare Sub-County.\nQuantitative data was analysed using Microsoft excel to generate frequencies and\npercentages and qualitative data was analyzed using content analysis method.\n3.11 Quality Control\nTo ensure the quality and validity of the data, several measures was implemented.\nA pilot study was conducted with a small sample from a neighboring sub-county to\ntest the data collection instruments and procedures, with feedback used to refine\nthe interview and FGD guides.

It is the degree to which a study is free from bias and\nconfounding variables, allowing researchers to confidently attribute any observed\neffects to the variables being studied. The internal reliability of the instruments was\nexamined by the researcher. Content validity data was used for the measurement\nof internal validity. By consulting with my research supervisor, the reliability of the\ninquiries being investigated was confirmed, and the researcher advised on what\nneeded to be corrected.\n3.11.1.2 External validity of the research instrument\nAccording to Khirsan and Crawford (2014), External validity is the extent to which\ngeneralization of the findings of the research to other situations, people, measures\nand setting. In this study, the external validity was used to determine whether the\nfindings of the study were generalized in other contexts.

Prior to data collection, the respondents were given\ninformation about the study and were assured of the confidentiality of their\ninformation using a participant information sheet. Additionally, the researcher\nmaintained confidentiality by using a clean dataset that was not contained any\nidentifying information. This approach helped to ensure that respondents were\nprotected and their responses remained unbiased.\nInformed consent was sought from each respondent by requesting them to sign\nconsent forms indicating their willingness to participate in the study. The\nquestionnaires were interviewer-administered, and after completion, the researcher\ncollected them on the same day and prepared them for analysis at the end of each\nworking day. Interviews were conducted with selected respondents to clarify\nsignificant issues that arised from the questionnaire responses. The researcher also\nconducted at least two Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) in every parish within\nBubaare Sub County, with each FGD composed of 10 participants.\n3.13 Limitations of the study\nThe study faced the limitation of scope and generalisability, which presented a\nsignificant methodological constraint, as it focused exclusively on Bubare Sub-\nCounty in Rubanda District. This geographic restriction hindered the applicability of\nthe findings to other parts of Uganda. Additionally, the unique cultural, economic,\nand social characteristics of Bubare may have differed from those in other\ncommunities, further limiting the extent to which the results could be generalized\nbeyond the specific study area.

Furthermore, the non-probability sampling technique used\nin this study was likely to introduce sampling bias, which limited the objectivity and\ngeneralizability of the study outcomes. To address this, the researcher ensured\ndiversity within the selected sample to reflect different backgrounds and\nexperiences, and acknowledged the sampling limitations while encouraging future\nstudies to use larger, probability-based sampling techniques for more representative\nresults.\nThe study encountered data collection challenges that affected the accuracy of the\nfindings. Respondents withheld truthful information due to the sensitive nature of\nteenage pregnancy and the associated stigma within the community, leading to\nsocial desirability bias. Additionally, reliance on self-reported data from teenage\nmothers or their families increased the risk of exaggerated or understated responses,\nwhich compromised the validity and reliability of the collected information. To\nmitigate this, the researcher assured participants of strict confidentiality and\nanonymity, conducted interviews in private and safe environments, and employed\ntrained data collectors skilled in handling sensitive topics to promote honest\ndisclosure.\nThe study adopted a cross-sectional design, which limited its ability to establish\ncausal relationships between teenage pregnancy and family stability over time.", "word_count": 285, "start_char": 68894, "end_char": 70983}
