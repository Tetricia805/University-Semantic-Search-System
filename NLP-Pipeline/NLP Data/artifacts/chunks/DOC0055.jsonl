In this course, you will be exposed to a multidisciplinary\ndomain that uses scientific methods, processes, statistics, and computational languages to draw\nknowledge and insights from unstructured data.\n\nDescription\nStudents will explore the theoretical issues, methods, tools, and problems that relate to data-rich issues\nin the humanities, social sciences, and sciences. Students will learn the core concepts of statistics and\ncomputing while working hands-on with real data. We will examine real-world examples and cases to\nplace data science techniques in the Ugandan context, develop data-analytic thinking, and illustrate\nthat proper application is as much an art as it is a science. In addition, we will work hands-on with the\nR programming language and its associated data analysis libraries/packages.\n\nAudience Description\nThis is a course intended Year 2, Semester 1, Computer Science\nDelivery Mode\n1. Group and Individual Projects\n2. Traditional Classroom-Based Teaching (online and in-person)\n3. Practical Lab Sessions\nCourse Objectives\n To develop practical data analysis skills, which can be applied to practical problems.\n To develop fundamental knowledge of concepts underlying data science projects from multiple\ndisciplines.\n To develop practical skills needed in modern analytics.\n To give a hands-on experience with real-world data analysis.\n To develop applied experience with data science languages\nExpected Learning Outcomes\nThe students should be able to;\n Incorporate data science principles to address data-dependent questions in the humanities,\nsocial sciences, and sciences.\n Apply basic exploratory analysis to identify abnormalities in data (i.e., missing values,\noutliers, redundant features, etc.)\n Anticipate and identify ways in which sampled data may be biased\n Perform the appropriate feature transformations for processing quantitative and qualitative\n\ndata\n Develop and deploy a Machine Learning model\n\nBrief Content Description\n Week 1 – Week 4: Foundation of Data Science (Experimental designs/business intelligence,\ndata classification, data descriptive statistics, data exploration using Python, data\nvisualization using Microsoft Office Excel/Tableau).\n Week 5: Assessment 1\n Week 5: Exploratory data analysis of quantitative & qualitative data types\n Week 6-Week 9: Introduction to Machine Learning, Supervised Learning &\nUnsupervised Learning\n Week 10: Assessment 2\n Week 10: Time Series Forecasting\n Week 11: Assessment 3 (Course Project)\n Week 11: ML model deployment\n Week 12: End of Semester Exam", "word_count": 445, "start_char": 0, "end_char": 3112}
