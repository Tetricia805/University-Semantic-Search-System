The study aimed\nto explore the effects of occupational health and safety on employee well-being,\ndetermine the influence of safety measures on the wellbeing of health workers, and\nevaluate the impact of personal protective equipment (PPE) on their welfare. A crosssectional research design was utilized, involving a sample of 54 participants through\nself-administered questionnaires and interview guides. Both quantitative and\nqualitative methods were employed for data analysis. Quantitative analysis included\ndescriptive statistics such as frequencies, percentages, and means, alongside\ninferential analyses which comprised correlation and regression analyses. The\ndescriptive findings indicated that while the well-being of health workers,\npsychological safety, and safety measures were rated positively, the availability of\npersonal protective equipment was deemed moderate. Furthermore, inferential\nresults showed that psychological safety and safety measures positively and\nsignificantly influenced the well-being of health workers, whereas personal protective\nequipment had a negative and insignificant impact on their well-being. Consequently,\nthe study concluded that psychological safety is a critical aspect of occupational\nsafety essential for the welfare of health workers, and that safety precautions are\nvital prerequisites for their well-being; however, inadequate personal protective\nequipment negatively affects their performance. It is therefore recommended that\nhealth institution management foster psychological safety for health workers,\nestablish clear safety protocols, and ensure the provision of adequate personal\nprotective equipment.", "word_count": 444, "start_char": 8818, "end_char": 12737}

The OED (2nd\nedition, revised 2005) defines well-being as \"the state of being comfortable, healthy,\nor happy.\" Over time, this definition is expected to be refined to better reflect the\ncontext of work and employment. The term has historical roots, first recorded in\n1613, indicating that it is not a recent creation or merely a product of the politically\ncorrect movement. The concept of well-being has existed for over three centuries,\nwith the 1922 OED definition significantly highlighting prosperity as well as health:\n\"Well-being - the state of being or doing well in life, happy, healthy, or prosperous\ncondition, welfare.\" The term is believed to have entered English from its French\nequivalent, which was influenced by the modern Latin expression, \"beneesse\" (Sain\nYoung, Workplace Well-being, Business Balls, 2019).", "word_count": 304, "start_char": 12526, "end_char": 14641}

At its core,\nwell-being is fundamentally about personal happiness—feeling good and living in a\nsafe and healthy manner. This entails ensuring that work does not undermine our\nbasic purposes and life needs, including those related to our careers. While many\naspects of work may not impact our primary life requirements directly, the\nimportance of well-being and stress is profound, affecting the mind, body, and soul\n(Sain Young, Workplace Well-being, Business Balls, 2019).\n1.4 Occupational Health and Safety\nOccupational Health and Safety (OHS) is the specialized discipline aimed at\nsafeguarding the health, safety, and welfare of individuals engaged in work. The\nprimary objective of OHS is to create a safe and healthy working environment. This\ndomain encompasses various practices, policies, and procedures designed to minimize\nrisks associated with workplace hazards, thereby enhancing employee well-being and\nproductivity (Alli, 2008).\nOHS involves identifying and mitigating physical, chemical, biological, and\npsychosocial hazards within the workplace. Physical hazards include issues related to\nmachinery, noise, and ergonomics, while chemical hazards involve exposure to\nharmful substances. Biological hazards pertain to infectious agents, and psychosocial\nhazards encompass stress, workload, and workplace violence (WHO, 2010).\nThe International Labor Organization (ILO) defines OHS as \"the science of the\nanticipation, recognition, evaluation, and control of hazards arising in or from the\nworkplace that could impair the health and well-being of workers, considering the\npotential impact on surrounding communities and the general environment\" (ILO,\n2001). This definition emphasizes the comprehensive nature of OHS, which extends\nbeyond mere compliance with safety regulations, actively promoting the health and\nwelfare of workers.\nOccupational Health and Safety is a crucial global issue affecting millions of workers\nacross diverse industries.

Moreover, there are\nover 300 million non-fatal occupational accidents occurring annually, highlighting the\nsignificant impact of workplace safety on the health and well-being of employees\n(ILO, 2019).\nIn the healthcare sector, risks are particularly heightened. Healthcare professionals\nregularly face various hazards, including exposure to infectious diseases, chemical\nagents, physical strain, and psychological stress. The World Health Organization\n(WHO) underscores the need to protect healthcare workers, asserting that their wellbeing is essential for ensuring quality patient care (WHO, 2020). There is a strong\nglobal push for the implementation of comprehensive OHS policies aimed at\naddressing these risks and ensuring a safe working environment for healthcare\npractitioners.\nIn Africa, occupational health and safety (OHS) conditions differ greatly from one\nnation to another, often mirroring broader socio-economic realities. Numerous African\nnations struggle to enforce effective OHS standards due to a lack of resources,\ninadequate infrastructure, and a deficiency of trained personnel (African Union,\n2015). The African Union has acknowledged the critical nature of OHS and urged\nmember states to enhance their OHS frameworks to safeguard workers across various\nindustries, particularly in healthcare.\nThe healthcare industry in Africa is especially at risk, facing difficulties such as a high\nprevalence of infectious diseases, reliance on outdated equipment, and a shortage of\nhealthcare professionals. This situation is exacerbated by inadequate training in OHS\nprotocols and limited access to personal protective equipment (PPE). Nevertheless,\ninitiatives have been undertaken to enhance OHS within the healthcare sector, with\nsome nations making notable advancements in policy formulation and execution (WHO\nAfrica, 2018).\nIn East Africa, nations like Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, and Uganda have been striving\nto refine their OHS frameworks. The East African Community (EAC) has played a vital\nrole in fostering regional collaboration and standardizing OHS practices (EAC, 2017).", "word_count": 347, "start_char": 16387, "end_char": 18898}

Healthcare\nworkers in East Africa frequently operate under difficult circumstances, facing high\npatient numbers, inadequate facilities, and insufficient PPE supplies. The COVID-19\npandemic has further exposed vulnerabilities within the healthcare system,\nhighlighting the urgent need for comprehensive OHS policies to protect healthcare\nprofessionals (UNDP, 2020).\nIn Uganda, the Ministry of Gender, Labor, and Social Development oversees OHS\ninitiatives. The country has made considerable legislative progress to enhance OHS\nstandards, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 2006, which\nestablishes a thorough framework for OHS in Uganda (Uganda Ministry of Gender,\nLabor, and Social Development, 2006). Nonetheless, practical enforcement of these\nstandards remains challenging, particularly in the healthcare sector.\nGulu Regional Referral Hospital in Northern Uganda serves a broad and diverse\ncommunity. The hospital encounters specific challenges due to its geographical\nlocation and the socio-economic conditions of the area. Healthcare workers at Gulu\nHospital face significant risks, including exposure to infectious diseases and physical\nhazards. While the hospital has made strides in addressing these issues through\ntraining and the provision of PPE, resource constraints continue to pose a major\nchallenge (Gulu Hospital Report, 2021).\nGlobally, concerns regarding the quality of health service delivery due to the\ninefficacy of health workers have been longstanding. Poor well-being among\nhealthcare providers often leads to inaccessibility and substandard care, resulting in\npoorer health outcomes, as individuals may avoid services due to negative\nexperiences (Dieleman & Harnmeijer, 2006). Consequently, various stakeholders,\nincluding researchers, policymakers, and implementers, have focused on factors\ninfluencing the well-being of healthcare workers.

According to Ahmad, Sattar, and Nawaz (2016), there is a noticeable research\ngap concerning occupational health and safety for health workers in developing\nnations, which this study aims to address. Concerns about occupational health and\nsafety have been present since structured work environments began. For instance,\nHippocrates (460-377 BC) wrote about the detrimental effects of unhealthy\nworkplaces on slaves, while Caesar (100-40 BC) appointed an officer to oversee the\nsafety of his legions (Namara, Mbera & Mbabazi, 2016).\nThe development of Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) frameworks gained\nmomentum in the 1990s, leading to the creation of an assessment tool at the\nUniversity of Michigan designed to evaluate various OHS aspects. This tool is known as\nthe Universal Assessment Instrument (UAI) due to its capacity to assess diverse\nsystems (Redinger, Levine, Blotzer, & Majewski, 2002). Redinger et al. (2002) state\nthat the UAI was developed to assist OHS professionals and their organizations in\nevaluating OHS effectiveness, measuring OHS management systems (OHSMS)\neffectiveness, and identifying unique OHS-related variables and metrics specific to\norganizations. Key elements in OHS highlighted by the instruments include\nmanagement commitment and resources, regulatory compliance and adherence,\naccountability, authority, and employee engagement. The International Labour\nOrganization (ILO), which advocates for workers' rights, emphasizes the importance of\nconsidering workers' viewpoints and placing them on equal footing with other\nstakeholders in workplace development (Namara et al., 2016). The ILO recommends\nthat workers' perspectives be integral to the creation and implementation of\nworkplace health and safety measures (Bennet, 2002). Namara et al. (2016) note that\nthe issue of health and safety encompasses a wide array of matters, including\npsychological safety like stress, fears, attitudes, as well as concerns regarding\nworkplace harassment, hazardous materials, and safety protocols. This study focuses\nspecifically on psychological safety, safety practices, and access to personal\nprotective equipment, as these issues are particularly significant within hospital\nsettings.", "word_count": 351, "start_char": 20838, "end_char": 23411}

In a study conducted by Namara\net al. (2016), occupational safety was identified as comprising psychological safety,\nsafety measures, and personal protective equipment.\nPsychological safety can be understood as a psychological environment that reflects\nindividuals' perceptions of how the work setting affects their mental wellbeing\n(Schepers, de Jong, Wetzel & de Ruyter, 2008). In this research, psychological safety\nwas operationally defined according to the framework proposed by Schepers et al.\n(2008), which includes employee participation, positive relationships among staff, and\nsupport from management. Safety measures involve communication about risks,\nsupplemented by symbols indicating the seriousness of safety situations (Hughes &\nFerrett, 2015). This study defined safety measures based on Khatib et al. (2015) as\ninvolving immediate disinfection following an incident and thorough accident\nreporting. Personal protective equipment (PPE) refers to both garments and tools\ndesigned to protect individuals from chemical, physical, and biological hazards\nencountered during hazardous material incidents (Yeung, Chan, Lee & Chan, 2002).\nThe study defined PPE as provided by Hersi et al. (2015), which includes access to\ngloves, skin protection, impermeable gowns, particulate respirators, sturdy footwear,\nand headgear.\nIn terms of wellbeing, it is defined as the successful completion of assigned tasks by\nindividuals, evaluated by a supervisor or organization against established standards,\nutilizing available physical and human resources in a dynamic environment (Tinofirei,\n2011). In this research, the performance of health workers was defined according to\nDubois, D'Amour, Pomey, Girard, and Brault (2013) as involving the acquisition,\ndeployment, and maintenance of healthcare resources, provision of healthcare\nservices, and effecting changes in patient conditions.", "word_count": 310, "start_char": 23222, "end_char": 25520}

They\naddress the healthcare needs and expectations of the population, not only through\ndirect care provision but also by raising awareness of unrecognized health concerns.\nHealth workers are pivotal in administering a majority of medical care and\nmedications (Anand & Bärnighausen, 2012). They play a key role in acquiring,\ndeploying, and maintaining healthcare resources, delivering services, and facilitating\nimprovements in patient conditions (Dubois et al., 2013). Recognizing the significance\nof occupational health and safety for healthcare professionals, the Ugandan\ngovernment has taken steps to enhance health safety. For example, it mandates that\nhospitals minimize occupational accidents, diseases, and injuries among their\nemployees, promote their health, ensure favourable work conditions, and foster\nawareness of occupational safety (Mugisa, 2012).\nRegarding wellbeing, health workers are expected to adopt the 5S methodology, which\nis a fundamental systematic approach aimed at enhancing productivity, quality, and\nsafety within organizations. The 5S principles include Sort (removal/organization), Set\n(orderliness), Shine (cleanliness), Standardize, and Sustain (discipline). The 5S\nmethods aim for zero downtime, improved product/service diversification, higher\nquality, reduced costs, timely delivery, enhanced safety, better maintenance,\nimproved customer satisfaction, and a more favourable organizational image (Ministry\nof Health, 2013). Despite these initiatives, the wellbeing and safety of health workers\nremain inadequate. High levels of absenteeism have been reported, reaching up to\n50% daily (Auditor General, 2015). Concerns also exist regarding the improper disposal\nof expired medications (Auditor General, 2016), as well as instances of verbal abuse\ntowards patients, rudeness, neglect, physical abuse, corruption, privacy violations,\npoor communication, resistance to accommodating traditional practices, and\nauthoritarian attitudes (Mannava et al., 2015).\nIn terms of occupational safety, health workers face numerous risks, including\nexposure to health hazards due to a lack of proper personal protective equipment,", "word_count": 340, "start_char": 25233, "end_char": 27786}

Workers contend with the risks of disease transmission in unclean\nenvironments, particularly from unsanitary restrooms, coupled with overwhelming\npatient volumes leading to physical exhaustion (Okello & Aluma, 2013). If left\nunaddressed, these conditions put the lives of health workers at risk, hence\nthreatening their overall wellbeing.

The selection of this hospital was motivated by the significant challenges it\nfaces regarding occupational safety, which impact employee wellbeing in various\nways.\n1.9.2 Time Scope\nThe temporal scope of the study spanned from March to September 2024. This period\nwas chosen due to ongoing restructuring efforts concerning the occupational health\nand safety of health workers, as indicated by the Ministry of Health (MoH, 2015). This\ntimeframe allowed the researchers to assess how these restructuring initiatives affect\nthe wellbeing of health workers.\n1.9.3 Content Scope\nThe content focus of the study revolved around occupational safety (independent\nvariable) and the wellbeing of health workers (dependent variable). Occupational\nsafety was analysed through aspects such as psychological safety, safety measures,\nand personal protective equipment. Psychological safety was evaluated according to\nworker participation, positive employee relations, and management support. Safety\nmeasures were scrutinized in terms of immediate disinfection and accident reporting.\nAccess to personal protective equipment included evaluation of availability of gloves,\nimpermeable gowns, particulate respirators, closed shoes, and headgear.

Furthermore, this study may lay the groundwork for\nfuture research by providing a better understanding of how occupational health and\nsafety and health programs affect the well-being of healthcare workers in Uganda.\n1.12 Justification of the Study\nAccess to healthcare is a basic human right. However, the effective well-being of\nhealthcare workers is essential; without it, patients‘ rights to health may be\ncompromised due to reduced access to healthcare services (Azétsop & Ochieng,\n2015).\nHealthcare workers fulfil the medical needs and expectations of the population\nthrough service delivery and by raising awareness of unexpressed health conditions\nand risks.\nThey are responsible for the majority of medical care and the distribution of\nmedications (Anand & Bärnighausen, 2012). Nonetheless, various factors affect the\nwell-being of healthcare workers, including occupational health and safety (Yusuf et\nal., 2012), as well as work expectations, skills, available resources, motivation, and\nsafety in the workplace (Dieleman & Harnmeijer, 2006).\nIn developing countries, there remains a research gap concerning the occupational\nhealth and safety of healthcare workers (Ahmad et al., 2016). Furthermore,\n\nsignificant issues persist regarding the well-being of healthcare workers, evidenced by\nhigh absenteeism rates (Auditor General, 2015), improper disposal of expired\nmedications (Auditor General, 2016), and instances of verbal abuse and rudeness\ntowards patients, including neglect and ridicule.\nMoreover, there are occurrences of physical abuse directed at women, corruption,\ndisregard for patient privacy, poor communication, an unwillingness to respect\ntraditional practices, and authoritarian or intimidating behaviour (Mannava et al.,\n2015). Consequently, it is vital for this research to explore how challenges in\noccupational health and safety may influence the well-being of healthcare workers.", "word_count": 395, "start_char": 31574, "end_char": 34426}

It examines relevant literature related to occupational safety and the wellbeing of healthcare workers, addressing key concepts, empirical studies, and the\ntheoretical foundations pertinent to the research. The focus is on previous studies\nthat elucidate the relationship between these topics and the current investigation,\nalongside a review of literature surrounding the relevant variables. These variables\nencompass psychological safety, safety measures, and personal protective equipment.\nThe chapter also identifies research gaps and offers a conceptual review to illustrate\nthe relationships among the study variables.\n2.2 Key Concepts\n2.2.1 Employee Well-being\nEmployee well-being is a complex concept that extends beyond merely avoiding\nillness or injury. It requires fostering a work environment that caters to the physical,\npsychological, and emotional needs of employees. Organizations that make employee\nwell-being a priority typically experience higher rates of employee engagement,\nlower absenteeism, and decreased turnover rates. In healthcare environments such as\nGulu Referral Hospital, promoting physical well-being may include ensuring that staff\nhave access to personal protective equipment (PPE), thereby minimizing the risk of\ninfection or injury. Maintaining a safe and hygienic environment helps limit the spread\nof diseases, while appropriate staff rotations can alleviate physical fatigue, especially\nin high-pressure settings like emergency departments.\nThe holistic nature of employee well-being indicates that its various components—\nphysical, mental, emotional, and social—are interconnected and must be addressed\ncollectively to cultivate a supportive workplace.

This has direct consequences for the\nquality of care provided, as employee well-being significantly impacts motivation,\nenergy levels, and job performance. As a result, employee well-being is vital for\norganizational success, affecting essential outcomes such as employee retention,\nperformance, and ultimately, patient care (Danna & Griffin, 1999). By prioritizing\nemployee well-being, hospitals can create a more motivated, engaged, and resilient\nworkforce, which in turn enhances patient care and overall hospital performance.\nResearch conducted in a public hospital in Nigeria demonstrated that the\nimplementation of stringent safety protocols and regular health assessments\nsignificantly decreased the incidence of workplace injuries and illnesses among\nhealthcare staff. Consequently, there was a noticeable improvement in staff\nproductivity and a reduction in absenteeism due to health-related concerns (Akinwale\n& George, 2020).\n2.2.2 Measures of Employee Well-being Physical Well-being: This aspect includes\nphysical health, energy levels, and the capacity to perform daily tasks. It is\nmeasurable through self-reported assessments of physical health, records of sick\nleave, and biometric indicators (e.g., blood pressure, heart rate).\nFor instance, hospitals that offer ergonomic workstations, access to exercise\nfacilities, and regular health evaluations contribute to the physical well-being of\nhealthcare workers. In turn, this can lower the risk of work-related injuries and\nillnesses, resulting in enhanced job performance and reduced healthcare costs\n(Cooper & Quick, 2017).\nIn public hospitals, especially in resource-constrained environments like Uganda,\nphysical health may be jeopardized by several factors. Healthcare workers are often\nexposed to infectious diseases such as tuberculosis (TB), HIV/AIDS, and more recently,\nCOVID-19, which pose serious health risks. Moreover, the physical requirements of", "word_count": 347, "start_char": 35832, "end_char": 38434}

This situation can result in injuries such as back strains or\nherniated discs, which are common among healthcare professionals (Hignett et al.,\n2016). Additionally, the long hours and irregular shifts typical in healthcare can lead\nto chronic fatigue, sleep disturbances, and other health problems that adversely\naffect the physical well-being of health workers (Josten et al., 2003).\nAnother critical issue is the exposure to hazardous materials. Healthcare workers,\nparticularly in laboratories, operating rooms, or those handling chemotherapy drugs,\nface risks from chemicals and radiation. Prolonged or improper exposure can cause\nboth acute and chronic health issues, including respiratory illnesses, skin conditions,\nand in severe cases, cancer (Levin et al., 2016).\nTo address these hazards, hospitals must establish comprehensive occupational health\nprograms that include routine health screenings, vaccination initiatives, ergonomic\ntraining, and access to protective equipment. For example, employing heightadjustable beds and mechanical lifts can greatly decrease the risk of musculoskeletal\ninjuries among nurses. Similarly, implementing strict protocols for the handling of\nhazardous substances and ensuring the availability of protective gear can reduce the\nlikelihood of chemical exposure (Clarke, 2020).\nExamples and Case Studies: In Uganda, public hospitals such as Mulago and Mengo\nencounter challenges related to their workers' physical health due to limited\nresources. A study conducted at Mulago Hospital revealed a high prevalence of\nmusculoskeletal disorders among nurses, with over 60% reporting back pain attributed\nto manual lifting of patients and heavy workloads (Katende et al., 2017). The study\nhighlighted the necessity for improved ergonomic practices and the provision of lifting\naids to alleviate the physical stress on healthcare workers.", "word_count": 355, "start_char": 38099, "end_char": 40661}

Many contracted the virus due to inadequate training on the use of personal\nprotective equipment (PPE) and a lack of proper safety procedures. This situation\nunderscores the critical need for providing adequate resources and training to\nsafeguard healthcare workers' physical health, particularly in low-resource\nenvironments (WHO, 2016).\nMental Well-being: This concept encompasses emotional, psychological, and social\nhealth. Tools such as the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) (Goldberg &\nWilliams, 1978) and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21) (Lovibond &\nLovibond, 1995) can be utilized for assessment.\nHealthcare professionals frequently face high-pressure situations, including the\nmanagement of critically ill patients, making life-altering decisions, and coping with\nthe emotional burden of witnessing patient suffering and mortality. Over time, these\nstressors can culminate in burnout, which is characterized by emotional fatigue,\ndepersonalization, and a diminished sense of personal achievement. Burnout\nsignificantly impacts the mental well-being of healthcare professionals and\ncompromises their ability to deliver quality care, potentially resulting in increased\nmedical errors, decreased patient satisfaction, and higher turnover rates (Maslach &\nLeiter, 2016).\nIn Uganda's public hospitals, for example, workers' mental health is often undermined\nby extreme patient-to-staff ratios, insufficient resources, and a lack of support\nsystems. At Mulago Hospital, healthcare workers endure considerable stress due to\novercrowding, high patient volumes, and recurrent exposure to traumatic situations.\nResearch conducted at this facility indicated that many employees exhibited burnout\nsymptoms, such as chronic exhaustion, irritability, and feelings of hopelessness, which\nnegatively impacted their job performance and overall health (Ahimbisibwe et al.,\n2018).", "word_count": 329, "start_char": 40278, "end_char": 42734}

The relentless\ndemand to perform, combined with the anxiety of making mistakes, can result in\nchronic stress, a significant precursor to anxiety disorders. Furthermore, the stigma\nsurrounding mental health issues often hinders healthcare workers from seeking\nassistance, intensifying the situation (Shanafelt et al., 2019).\nTackling mental health challenges among healthcare professionals necessitates a\nholistic strategy that includes routine mental health evaluations, accessible\ncounselling and support services, and the fostering of a positive workplace culture.\nFor instance, establishing employee assistance programs (EAPs) that provide\nconfidential counselling can offer essential support for individuals grappling with\nstress or mental health issues. Creating an environment that promotes open dialogue\nand diminishes the stigma associated with mental health can also help cultivate a\nmore supportive and resilient workforce (Saksvik et al., 2017).\nExamples and Case Studies: A study at Mengo Hospital showed that healthcare\nworkers who had access to mental health support services reported lower stress and\nburnout levels compared to those without such access. The hospital introduced a peer\nsupport initiative, allowing workers to share experiences and offer mutual\nencouragement, significantly enhancing their mental well-being (Namata et al.,\n2019).\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare professionals around the globe faced\nextraordinary levels of stress and anxiety. Hospitals that offered psychological\nsupport, including counselling services and stress management training, observed\nimproved mental health outcomes for their staff. For instance, facilities in Italy and\nSpain, which were heavily impacted by the pandemic, implemented mental health\ninitiatives that featured regular check-ins, relaxation exercises, and peer support,\neffectively alleviating the mental health challenges posed by the crisis (Rajkumar,\n2020).", "word_count": 335, "start_char": 42317, "end_char": 44829}

Various tools, such as the Job Satisfaction Survey (JSS) (Spector, 1985) and the\nMinnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire (MSQ) (Weiss, Dawis, England, Lofquist, &\nHeneman, 1967), may be employed for measurement.\nJob satisfaction is a complex and multi-dimensional idea that reflects how well an\nemployee's job meets their expectations and needs. It includes both intrinsic\nmotivators, such as the fulfilment and achievement derived from the work itself, and\nextrinsic factors, like salary, benefits, and working conditions.\nFor healthcare workers, job satisfaction is particularly vital owing to the challenging\nand often high-pressure nature of their roles. Elements that contribute to job\nsatisfaction in healthcare settings include a supportive environment, opportunities for\ncareer advancement, acknowledgment of good performance, and manageable\nworkloads. For instance, a nurse who feels valued by their employer, receives\ncontinual training, and maintains a healthy work-life balance is likely to experience\ngreater job satisfaction (Herzberg, 1968).\nOn the other hand, factors that can lead to job dissatisfaction encompass insufficient\ncompensation, lack of recognition, poor work conditions, and limited career\nadvancement opportunities. In public hospitals, where resources are often scarce and\nworkloads extensive, these elements can contribute to decreased job satisfaction,\nhigher turnover rates, and increased burnout among healthcare workers (Maslach &\nLeiter, 1997).\nResearch at Mengo Hospital in Uganda revealed that healthcare workers who\nexpressed high job satisfaction attributed this to supportive management,\nopportunities for professional growth, and a positive workplace atmosphere. In\ncontrast, those indicating low job satisfaction cited poor pay, heavy workloads, and\ninsufficient recognition as significant contributors (Namata et al., 2019).\nIn a similar context in the United States, a hospital that launched a recognition\nprogram for outstanding employees witnessed a notable rise in staff job satisfaction.", "word_count": 350, "start_char": 44371, "end_char": 46958}

The World Health\nOrganization (WHO) defines health as \"a state of complete physical, mental, and\nsocial well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity\" (WHO, 1946).\nThis definition emphasizes the holistic aspect of health, acknowledging that authentic\nhealth encompasses not only the lack of physical health issues but also mental\nwellness and social cohesion.\nIn relation to occupational health and safety (OHS), the notion of health is vital, as\nthe work environment greatly affects the overall well-being of employees. The\ncircumstances in which people work—such as the physical setting, organizational\nculture, and psychosocial elements—are crucial in shaping their health outcomes. It is\nessential to maintain a safe and healthy workplace, not only to prevent work-related\ninjuries and illnesses but also to enhance the broader well-being of employees.\nOccupational safety encompasses a series of plans, actions, and protocols that guide\norganizations in systematically managing health and safety risks related to their\noperations (Dieleman & Harnmeijer, 2006). In this context, occupational safety\nincludes elements such as psychological safety, safety measures, and personal\nprotective equipment.\nOHS in the healthcare sector involves various activities, including risk assessments,\nsafety training, adherence to safety protocols, and ongoing monitoring of workplace\nconditions. These efforts aim to identify and reduce risks, ensure compliance with\nsafety regulations, and foster a safety-oriented culture within the organization. For\ninstance, hospitals may perform routine safety audits to detect potential hazards,\nsuch as improper handling of dangerous materials or incorrect use of medical devices,\nand implement corrective measures (Reese, 2015).", "word_count": 344, "start_char": 46627, "end_char": 49073}

Providing access to mental health resources and stress management\nprograms can assist healthcare workers in managing the demands of their roles, which\ncan reduce burnout and enhance job satisfaction. Additionally, ergonomic\nimprovements such as adjustable workstations and proper lifting techniques can help\nprevent musculoskeletal injuries among healthcare staff (WHO, 2021).\nFor example, a case study from Mengo Hospital in Uganda demonstrates that the\nrollout of an OHS program resulted in marked improvements in workplace safety and\nemployee health. This program included consistent safety training, the formation of\nsafety committees, and the enforcement of strict infection control measures.\nConsequently, the hospital saw a decrease in workplace accidents and injuries.\nPersonal protective equipment (PPE) refers to clothing and gear designed to protect\nindividuals from chemical, physical, and biological hazards encountered during\nhazardous materials incidents (Yeung et al., 2002). In this research, PPE included\naccess to gloves, skin protection, impermeable gowns, particulate respirators, closed\nshoes, and headgear.\nIn healthcare environments, PPE comprises items such as gloves, masks, gowns, face\nshields, and respirators. Each type of PPE is intended for a specific purpose and is\nchosen based on the nature of the hazard. For instance, gloves and gowns offer\nprotection against infectious materials, while masks and respirators shelter against\nairborne pathogens. During exposure to highly contagious or hazardous pathogens,\nsuch as in the event of an infectious disease outbreak, the use of PPE is essential to\nprevent transmission and safeguard healthcare personnel (Gillen et al., 2002).\nThe efficiency of PPE hinges on the correct selection, fit, and application. Healthcare\nprofessionals must receive training on the proper ways to put on, take off, and\ndispose of PPE to reduce the risk of contamination. For example, during the COVID-19\npandemic, healthcare workers globally were mandated to wear N95 respirators and\nfull-body gowns when caring for patients infected with the virus.

During the Ebola\noutbreak, the hospital enforced strict PPE protocols that required full-body gowns,\ngloves, masks, and face shields for all personnel involved in caring for Ebola patients.\nThese strategies successfully curtailed the virus's spread among healthcare workers,\nhighlighting PPE's vital role in ensuring occupational safety (Namata et al., 2019).\nAdditionally, during the COVID-19 pandemic, hospitals worldwide encountered\ndifficulties in obtaining sufficient PPE supplies for their staffs. In the U.S., a hospital\nin New York instituted stringent PPE protocols, including the use of N95 respirators,\nface shields, and isolation gowns for personnel treating COVID-19 patients. Despite\nthe challenges faced, these measures effectively protected healthcare workers from\ninfection, emphasizing PPE's importance in managing infectious disease outbreaks\n(CDC, 2020).\nPsychological Safety: Psychological safety can be understood as a psychological\nenvironment that reflects individuals' perceptions of the impact their work setting has\non their personal well-being (Schepers et al., 2008). This study emphasizes the\nimportance of worker engagement, positive relationships among employees, and\nsupport from management.\nIn healthcare settings, fostering psychological safety is vital for enabling healthcare\nprofessionals to voice concerns about safety risks, seek assistance when necessary,\nand propose enhancements to work processes. When employees feel psychologically\nsecure, they are more inclined to take proactive actions that enhance patient safety,\nsuch as double-checking medications, reporting near misses, and collaborating with\ncolleagues on best practices.\nIn an environment that prioritizes psychological safety, a nurse may feel empowered\nto challenge a doctor's prescription if there are concerns regarding patient welfare.", "word_count": 335, "start_char": 51027, "end_char": 53477}

Conversely, in institutions where psychological safety is insufficient,\nhealthcare professionals may hesitate to speak out due to fears of retaliation,\nfostering a culture of silence that leads to unreported errors and missed opportunities\nfor learning (Nembhard & Edmondson, 2006).\nTo cultivate a psychologically safe workspace, strong leadership is essential. Managers\nand supervisors should actively promote open dialogue, demonstrate respectful\ninteractions, and respond constructively to feedback. Additionally, implementing clear\npolicies that safeguard those who speak out, and ensuring every team member feels\nvalued and respected, regardless of their position, is crucial. For instance, adopting a\n―just culture‖ approach in hospitals, which emphasizes learning from mistakes rather\nthan assigning blame, can greatly enhance psychological safety and the overall safety\nculture (Dekker, 2012).\nResearch conducted in the United States indicates that hospitals that adopted\nmethods to boost psychological safety, including leadership development and teambuilding initiatives, experienced notable improvements in patient safety metrics. One\nhospital, for example, established regular safety briefings where staff could freely\ndiscuss safety concerns and share enhancement ideas, resulting in reduced medication\nerrors and increased reporting of near misses (Edmondson, 1999).\nSimilar efforts have been observed in public hospitals in Uganda, where measures to\nenhance psychological safety have included the establishment of anonymous reporting\nsystems that allow healthcare workers to report errors or safety issues without fear of\nreprisal. These initiatives have facilitated increased reporting of safety concerns and\nfostered a more open and transparent safety culture (Ahimbisibwe et al., 2018).\nSafety\nPrecautions: Safety\nprecautions\ninvolve\nutilizing\nsymbols\nin\nsafety\ncommunications to indicate the severity of safety conditions (Hughes & Ferrett,\n2015).

For instance, to mitigate the risk of needlestick\ninjuries, healthcare personnel receive training to handle needles and sharp\ninstruments with care, employing safety-engineered devices and promptly disposing of\nthem in designated sharps containers post-use.\nOne key safety measure is the enforcement of infection control protocols, which\ninclude hand hygiene, sterilization of medical tools, and the use of PPE such as gloves\nand masks. These practices are vital for preventing the transmission of infections\namong healthcare staff and patients. In high-risk areas like operating rooms or\nisolation units, more rigorous precautions may be necessary, including specialized PPE\nlike N95 respirators or full-body gowns, to guard against airborne or highly contagious\npathogens (Gillen et al., 2002).\nA notable case study from Mulago Hospital in Uganda underscores the significance of\nsafety precautions in safeguarding healthcare workers. The hospital executed a\ncomprehensive infection control initiative that featured regular training on hand\nhygiene, PPE use, and safe management of infectious waste. Consequently, the\nincidence of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) among staff significantly\ndiminished, highlighting the effectiveness of such safety measures in mitigating\noccupational exposure risks (Namata et al., 2019).\nIn another instance, a hospital in the United States established a safe patient handling\nprogram aimed at preventing musculoskeletal injuries among nurses. This initiative\nincorporated mechanical lifts and transfer devices, alongside training on suitable body\nmechanics.

He posited\nthat injuries arise from specific epidemiological episodes, including seasonal\nvariations, demographic factors, and an individual's vulnerability (Hulme & Finch,\n2015). The theory asserts that two key elements, namely predisposition\ncharacteristics and situational characteristics, significantly influence both the\nconditions under which accidents occur and the resulting effects of those accidents.\nThe effects of accidents refer to the injuries and damages sustained by individuals,\nwhich serve as measurable indicators of the incident.\nAccidents occur under conditions that are unexpected, unavoidable, and\nunintentional, stemming from both predispositional and situational characteristics.\nPredispositional characteristics encompass factors such as individuals' susceptibility\n(hosts), hazardous environments, and agents that cause injuries, among others\n(Bonilla-Escobar & Gutiérrez, 2014).\nAccording to the theory, each individual possesses a distinct predisposition to injury,\ninfluenced by their unique combination of intrinsic risk factors and additional external\nrisk factors that increase their susceptibility. Situational characteristics involve the\nindividual‘s risk assessments, the priorities set by supervisors, and prevailing attitudes\n(Hulme & Finch, 2015).

In such environments, employees do not feel pressured about their selfimage, job position, or the adverse effects of work, allowing them to express\nthemselves genuinely and engage with different facets of their identity. When\nemployees partake in risky behaviors as a team, the execution of those actions is\nperceived as safe and acceptable among their colleagues (Chen, Gao, Zheng & Ran,\n2015).\nPsychological safety can be classified into self-psychological safety (an individual's\nperception of their own safety) and others' psychological safety (the perception of\nsafety in communication with others) (Tynan, 2005). In an environment characterized\nby psychological safety, members of an organization feel free to voice their opinions;\nthey are encouraged to take risks and foster mutual trust and respect, aligned in their\nbeliefs and values (Chen et al., 2015).\nTherefore, organizational psychological safety is the perception developed by\nemployees regarding the characteristics of their work environment, including\nmanagement support, clarity in job roles, and the allowance for self-expression\n(Edmondson, Kramer & Cook, 2004). Numerous scholars (e.g., Alizadeh &\nCheraghalizadeh, 2015; Dar, Akmal, Naseem & din Khan, 2011; Chen et al., 2015;\nJudeh, 2011; Min & Yong, 2014; Ning & Jin, 2009) have linked psychological safety to\nemployee well-being.\nFor example, Alizadeh and Cheraghalizadeh (2015) explored the influence of\norganizational support on employee well-being with full-time employees engaged in\nconstruction projects in Iran. Their findings revealed that organizational support had\na significantly positive effect on employee well-being. Similarly, Dar et al.

(2011)\ninvestigated the negative impact of stress stemming from low psychological safety on\n\nemployee well-being in Pakistan's business sector. They found that issues like feeling\nundervalued, workplace victimization/bullying, ambiguous roles, fear of job loss,\nexposure to traumatic incidents, and economic instability led to decreased\nconcentration, mental blockages, and impaired decision-making skills, ultimately\nadversely affecting employee well-being.\nIn another study, Chen et al. (2015) reviewed the concepts, measures, antecedents,\nand consequences associated with psychological safety, concluding that it serves as an\nintermediary factor influencing organization-related outcomes, including employee\nwell-being. Judeh (2011) researched employee participation in enhancing teamwork\neffectiveness within the Jordanian glass and ceramic industries and concluded that\nsuch participation positively affected teamwork. Min and Yong (2014) examined\nworkplace relationships in China, finding a significant positive impact on employee\nwell-being stemming from strong relationships among colleagues.\nMoreover, Ning and Jin (2009) investigated how a climate of trust affects individual\nwell-being among employees and their supervisors in a Chinese organization. Their\nfindings indicated that psychological safety enhances individuals' focus and improves\noverall well-being.\nThe literature indicates that scholars have attempted to establish connections\nbetween psychological safety and employee well-being. However, several contextual\ngaps remain. Notably, none of the studies were conducted in Uganda, all having taken\nplace within Asian settings. Additionally, no research has focused on hospital settings;\ninstead, studies have primarily been centred on construction and industrial sectors.\nThese gaps underscore the importance of conducting this study within the specified\ncontext.\n2.4.3 Link between Personal Protective Equipment and Health Workers' Well-being\nPersonal Protective Equipment (PPE), also referred to as Personal Protective Devices\n(PPDs), is specifically designed to safeguard workers from injuries or illnesses\nresulting from exposure to hazardous substances that may cause infection.

It is common for workers to don multiple types of PPE\nsimultaneously, depending on their anticipated exposure during specific tasks. For\ninstance, a health worker may require gloves, a facemask, and an apron concurrently\nbased on the activities being performed (Aguwa, Arinze-Onyia, & Ndu, 2016). In the\ncontext of infectious diseases, health care workers (HCWs) typically implement\nstandard precautions along with transmission-based precautions, utilizing PPE to\nguard against droplet, contact, or airborne transmission.\nThe appropriate and consistent utilization of PPE is crucial in mitigating nosocomial\ntransmission, thereby ensuring the safety of both patients and HCWs (Zellmer, Van\nHoof & Safdar, 2015). Therefore, the importance of using suitable and high-quality\npersonal protective equipment in the workplace cannot be overstated. Healthcareassociated infections (HAIs) are among the most prevalent adverse events in\nhealthcare delivery systems, impacting millions annually and leading to significant\nmorbidity and mortality. A substantial number of healthcare providers and patients\ncontract infections within healthcare settings (Haile, Engeda & Abdo, 2017).\nAbad, Lafuente, and Vilajosana (2013) evaluated the OHSAS 18001 certification\nprocess to identify its primary drivers and impacts on safety, well-being, and labour\nproductivity among employees in Spanish firms. Their findings demonstrated that\nequipping workers assigned to high-risk tasks with safety gear such as safety glasses,\nhelmets, boots, gloves, masks, jumpsuits, and shoes resulted in marked improvements\nin safety, well-being, and productivity. In a similar vein, Agbola (2012) investigated\nhow health and safety management affected worker safety at the Ghana Ports and\nHarbours Authority, assessing the effectiveness of these measures in decreasing\naccidents and fatalities and examining the impact of work-related illnesses. The study\nconcluded that a lack of essential safety equipment negatively influenced employee\nwell-being.

The study found significant effects of\ngloves and goggles across all test scenarios. Simon (2010) evaluated the impact of\nLevel A suits on fine and gross motor skills among seven members of the National\nGuard's Civil Support Team (CST) in the United States, considering measures of wellbeing like task completion time and accuracy. The results indicated that wearing the\nsuit had a significant detrimental effect on both well-being metrics.\n2.4.4 Connection between Worker Participation and Well-being of Health Workers\nEmployee involvement in decision-making is linked to enhanced job satisfaction,\nlower stress levels, and improved overall well-being (Leipart, 1988; Wagner, 1986).\nEngaging workers in this way can also foster increased organizational commitment,\nbetter job performance, and greater innovation (Cotton, Vollrath, Froese, & Lengnick-\nHall, 1988).\nIn the healthcare sector, engaging health workers in safety-related decision-making\ncan take various forms, including participation in safety committees, contributing to\nthe creation of safety protocols, and actively participating in ongoing safety training\nand drills. When workers are allowed input on safety issues, their insights into\npractical challenges and potential solutions, more applicable to the real-world\nhospital setting, can be invaluable.\nIn hospitals that promote worker participation, frontline staff such as nurses may be\nactively involved in developing infection control measures. Their contributions can\nenhance the feasibility and realism of the protocols, given the constraints of their\ndaily responsibilities. Moreover, this involvement helps cultivate a sense of ownership\nregarding safety decisions, which can lead to stronger adherence to protocols (Gillen\net al., 2002).", "word_count": 337, "start_char": 66063, "end_char": 68467}

This disjunction can result in a lack of compliance with safety\nmeasures, a higher likelihood of accidents, and a detrimental safety culture. For\ninstance, if a hospital adopts a novel procedure for handling hazardous materials\nwithout consulting the affected workers, it may face unforeseen difficulties in\nimplementation, which could result in non-compliance and heightened safety risks\n(Clarke, 2020).\nTo effectively cultivate worker participation, hospital leadership must commit to\nincorporating employees at all levels into safety-related decision-making processes.\nThis can be facilitated by creating safety committees comprising representatives from\nvarious departments, hosting regular safety meetings where workers can express\nconcerns and suggestions, and ensuring ongoing training in safety protocols.\n2.4.5 The Link between Positive Employee Relations and the Well-being of Health\nFostering strong employee relations leads to a supportive work atmosphere, higher\njob satisfaction, and enhanced organizational performance (Cropanzano, Rupp, &\nByrne, 2003). Supportive interactions with colleagues and supervisors cultivate a\nsense of belonging, provide social support, and enhance job security, all of which are\nvital for employee well-being (Einarsen, Hoel, & Notelaers, 2007).\nPositive employee relations are established through effective communication, trust,\nand mutual respect between staff and management. In the context of a hospital, this\nmeans healthcare professionals should feel at ease when voicing concerns, giving\nfeedback, and collaborating with their peers and supervisors. When relationships in\nthe workplace are healthy, employees are more inclined to feel satisfied with their\njobs, engaged in their roles, and connected to their workplace, which positively\naffects their overall well-being.", "word_count": 313, "start_char": 68170, "end_char": 70476}

These meetings foster transparency\nand trust, which can alleviate stress and enhance job satisfaction. Moreover, healthy\nrelationships with fellow employees can promote teamwork and collaboration,\ncontributing to a more harmonious and supportive work atmosphere (Gittell, 2003).\nOn the other hand, negative employee relations, marked by poor communication,\ndistrust, and conflict, can create a dysfunctional working environment. In such\nsituations, healthcare workers may feel alienated, undervalued, and stressed,\nadversely affecting their well-being and job performance. For instance, a nurse who\nlacks support from their supervisor may face heightened stress and burnout, which\ncan lead to diminished job satisfaction and an increased inclination to leave the\norganization (Maslach & Leiter, 1997).\nA study conducted in Uganda's public hospitals revealed that healthcare workers who\nreported positive relationships with their supervisors and peers also experienced\ngreater job satisfaction and overall well-being. These professionals identified open\nlines of communication, mutual respect, and collaboration as crucial elements\ninfluencing their positive work experience. In contrast, those who reported negative\nemployee relations faced heightened stress and burnout, resulting in lower job\nsatisfaction and well-being (Namata et al., 2019).\nSimilarly, a case study from the United States showed that a hospital which\nimplemented strategies to enhance employee relations witnessed significant\nimprovements in job satisfaction and well-being among its workforce. This initiative\nincluded team-building activities, communication workshops, and avenues for\nemployees to give feedback to management.

Research\nhas indicated that leaders demonstrating authentic concern for their employees,\noffering necessary resources, and fostering a supportive organizational culture can\nsignificantly elevate employee satisfaction, engagement, and overall health (Rafferty\n& Griffin, 2006).\nIn a hospital environment, effective management support means equipping healthcare\nworkers with the resources, training, and guidance they need to perform their tasks\nsafely and competently. This support manifests in various forms, such as providing\naccess to continuing education, offering flexible work schedules, recognizing and\nrewarding accomplishments, and cultivating a positive work environment.\nA hospital that regularly encourages staff training exhibits its dedication to employee\ndevelopment and well-being. Such support not only bolsters healthcare workers' skills\nand knowledge but also enhances their job satisfaction and sense of belonging within\nthe organization (Kanter, 1977).\nManagement support also entails responsiveness to healthcare workers' needs and\nconcerns. For instance, if a nurse raises issues about the adequacy of personal\nprotective equipment (PPE), a supportive management team should promptly address\nthe matter, ensuring the nurse feels valued and secure. This responsiveness is\nparticularly critical in high-stakes environments like hospitals, where worker wellbeing is closely tied to the availability of necessary resources and support\n(Eisenberger et al., 1986).\nAt Mulago Hospital, healthcare professionals who experienced strong management\nsupport reported higher levels of job satisfaction and well-being. These workers\nhighlighted access to professional development opportunities, proactive leadership,\nand a supportive work environment as significant factors contributing to their positive\nexperiences. Conversely, those who perceived a lack of management support faced", "word_count": 326, "start_char": 72032, "end_char": 74545}

For example,\na hospital in the United Kingdom initiated a leadership development program aimed\nat boosting management support for healthcare workers. This program included\ntraining managers on how to provide constructive feedback, acknowledge employee\nachievements, and address employee concerns. Consequently, the hospital\nexperienced heightened job satisfaction and lower turnover rates among its staff\n(Kanter, 1977).\n2.4.7 Connection between Work-Life Balance and the Well-Being of Healthcare\nEstablishing a balance between professional responsibilities and personal life is vital\nfor the overall well-being of employees (Greenhaus & Beutell, 1985). Work-life\nconflict arises when work and personal life demands compete with one another, often\nresulting in heightened levels of stress, burnout, and reduced job satisfaction\n(Demerouti, Bakker, Nachreiner, & Schaufeli, 2001).\nIn the healthcare field, achieving work-life balance can be particularly difficult due to\nextended shifts, heavy patient loads, and the emotional strain of managing life-anddeath scenarios. Nevertheless, such balance is essential for the well-being of\nhealthcare professionals, enabling them to rejuvenate, sustain their mental and\nphysical health, and meet personal and familial obligations. A healthy work-life\nbalance is linked to increased job satisfaction, enhanced mental health, and reduced\nlevels of burnout and turnover (Frone, 2003).\nFor instance, hospitals that provide flexible scheduling, paid leave, and childcare\nsupport can significantly assist healthcare workers in better managing their\nprofessional and personal responsibilities.

As a result, the hospital experienced reduced absenteeism\nand burnout rates, alongside increased job satisfaction among its staff, highlighting\nthe favourable effects of work-life balance on employee well-being (Frone, 2003).\nThe aforementioned literature indicates that researchers have made considerable\nefforts to explore the impact of safety measures on the well-being of healthcare\nworkers. However, notable gaps exist at both contextual and empirical levels.\nContextually, none of the studies were conducted in Ugandan hospitals. Empirically,\nsome research presented conflicting findings; while most studies affirmed the positive\nimpact of personal protective equipment (PPE) on worker well-being, Simon (2010)\nreported significant negative effects. These contextual and empirical inconsistencies\nunderscore the need for this study to examine the effects of PPE on the well-being of\nhealthcare workers within a public referral hospital in Uganda.\n2.5 Summary of Literature Review\nThe literature review indicates that occupational safety is connected to the wellbeing of workers. However, significant gaps at both contextual and empirical levels\nwarrant further investigation. For example, no studies have been performed within\nthe Ugandan context, and many existing studies are based outside the healthcare\nsector. Additionally, certain studies yielded contradictory results concerning the\n\nproposed research questions, suggesting that some occupational safety elements, like\npersonal protective equipment, may have adverse effects on well-being. These gaps\nemphasize the necessity for this research to assess whether occupational safety\ninfluences the well-being of healthcare workers in Uganda‘s healthcare system.", "word_count": 379, "start_char": 76231, "end_char": 79004}

It encompasses the\nresearch design, study area, sampling techniques, sample size and selection methods,\ndata collection techniques, data collection instruments, data analysis procedures, and\nanticipated limitations.\n3.2 Research Design and Approach\nThis study will implement a cross-sectional research design, which involves examining\neither the entire population or a subset by gathering information about a specific\nissue at a single point in time (Olsen & Marie, 2004). The cross-sectional approach will\nbe employed due to its speed, ease, and cost-effectiveness, given that minimal time\nis spent in the field. Utilizing this design, the researcher can gather relevant data\nefficiently (Gravlee, Kennedy, Godoy & Leonard, 2009). Both quantitative and\nqualitative methods will be employed; the quantitative method will assist in testing\nhypotheses or research questions to derive statistical inferences, while the qualitative\nmethod will enrich the quantitative findings by providing detailed insights\n(Guetterman, Fetters & Creswell, 2015). Thus, the researcher will be positioned to\ndraw statistical conclusions and conduct comprehensive analyses. This methodological\nprocess will include four primary activities: documentary analysis, field studies, data\ncollection, data analysis, and report writing along with dissemination.\n3.3 Area of Study\nThe focus of this study is the impact of occupational health and safety on employee\nwell-being in public hospitals, specifically using Gulu Referral Hospital as a case study.\n3.4 Study Population\n\nA total of 54 employees from various departments participated in the study, including\nlaboratory technicians, clinical officers, medical assistants, midwives, gynaecologists,\nand medical doctors.\n\n3.5 Sample Size and Selection\nThe expected sample size was set at 60 respondents for both the questionnaire survey\nand the interviews. The sample size was determined using the Yamane (1967)\nformula: n=N/(1+N(e)2), where n represents the sample size, N is the study\npopulation, 1 is a constant, and e is the confidence interval (0.05).\nThe calculations are as follows:\nn = N / (1 + N(e)2)\nWhere:\nN = 70 (target population)\ne = 0.05\nn = 70 / (1 + 70 x (0.05)2)\nn = 70 / (1 + 70 x 0.0025)\nn = 70 / 1.175\nn = 59.57\nThus, the sample size is rounded to 60.\nTable 1: Distribution of Study Population and Sample\nCategory\nPopulation\nSample\nSampling Techniques\nAdministration\nPurposive sampling\nDoctors (Specialists)\nPurposive sampling\nMedical Officers\nNurses\nAllied Health Professionals\nTotal", "word_count": 442, "start_char": 78603, "end_char": 81644}

Simple random sampling involves randomly selecting individuals\nfrom the population, thereby giving each individual an equal opportunity to be\nincluded in the sample (Clark & Creswell, 2008). Respondents will be selected by\ndrawing numbers assigned to them, ensuring a representative sample for generalizing\nthe findings. Conversely, purposive sampling will be utilized to select specific\nindividuals to gather in-depth perspectives, as the study incorporates both\nquantitative and qualitative elements. The purposive sampling method applied will be\nintensity purposive sampling, which focuses on selecting a limited number of key\nrespondents who can provide detailed information and insights about the phenomenon\nof interest (Palinkas et al., 2015). The respondents targeted through purposive\nsampling will include administrative staff and specialists in the hospital.\n3.7 Data Type and Source\nThis study will gather both quantitative and qualitative data. Quantitative data will\ninclude employee well-being and occupational health and safety scores sourced from\nstructured questionnaires, while qualitative data will be derived from interviews with\nemployees regarding their work experiences.\n3.8 Data Collection Methods\nData collection for this study will involve two methods: a questionnaire survey and\ninterviews. A questionnaire survey is a method that directly questions participants\nabout their perceptions of the study issue (Zohrabi, 2013). This method is\nadvantageous for its efficiency in data collection. Interviewing, as a qualitative data\ncollection method, allows the researcher to obtain detailed responses from\nparticipants regarding the study variables, leading to a deeper exploration of their\nviewpoints (Sutton & Austin, 2015). The interviews will be conducted with\nadministrative staff and doctors (specialists).\n\n3.9 Data Collection Instruments\nThe study will employ two instruments for data collection: a self-administered\nquestionnaire and an interview guide. A self-administered questionnaire is a\nquantitative data collection tool (Siniscalco & Auriat, 2005). It will comprise two\nsections—Section A focusing on background characteristics, and Section B addressing\nthe main variables. The questionnaire will consist of close-ended questions, chosen\nfor their simplicity in administration, ease of coding and analysis, potential for\ncomparisons and quantification, and likelihood of yielding complete responses while\nminimizing irrelevant data (Artino Jr, La Rochelle, Dezee & Gehlbach, 2014).", "word_count": 387, "start_char": 81413, "end_char": 84284}

The study was guided by three\nspecific objectives which was to investigate the effects of occupational health and\nsafety on employee wellbeing, ascertain the influence of safety precautions on\nwellbeing of health workers and assess the influence of personal protective\nequipment on wellbeing of health workers at Gulu regional referral hospital.\n4.1 Response Rate\nThe sample frame of the study comprised of 60 healthcare workers at Gulu regional\nreferral hospital, after administering the questionnaire, 54 of the respondents\ncorrectly filled in the questionnaire thus ensuring a response rate of 90%. The above\nresponse rate falls above the minimum recommended sample rate by scholars (Holtom\net al., 2022). It is therefore safe to generalize the study findings to Gulu regional\nreferral hospital only.\n4.2 Findings on Demographic Characteristic of the respondents\nThe study collected a number of demographic characteristics of the study respondents\nincluding gender, age, marital status, level of education, work experience and\nemployment specification (job title).
