This is a quadratic inequality.\nWe find the need to factor the inequality as (x −4)(x −3) > 0. We want the values of x\nthat make (x −4)(x −3) positive. Lets look at case 1\n- (both numbers are positive). When (x−4) > 0 and (x−3) > 0. If x−4 > 0 then x > 4.\nIf x −3 > 0 then x > 3.\nWe choose a solution that satisfies both inequalities.

A function is a special kind of relation in which\nall ordered pairs have unique first elements. Every element of the first set is assigned to\nan element of the second set. Usually subsets of the set of real numbers R are considered.\nA function involves two sets and a rule of correspondence between them. The rule of\ncorrespondence specifies how to pair the elements of the one set with those in the other.\nA function is a relation in which for each member of the first set there is a single corresponding member of the second set. A rule exists between two quantities.\nA function has to satisfy The Vertical Line Test.\n1.5.1\nDomain and Range as a set of Ordered Pairs.\nThe domain (D) is the set of all values that the first elements, in the ordered pair can\ntake.

This ordered pair can be represented as (x, f(x)). We read f(x) as ”f of x” or\n”f at x” since f(x) gives the value of f at x. This relation can also be represented as:\nx ⇒f(x)\nOften we replace f(x) by y, also called the dependent variable, and write y = f(x). With\nthis notation, x is called the independent variable. For example f(x) = 3x + 2 may be\nwritten as y = 3x + 2.\n1.5.3\nEvaluation of Functions\nThe evaluation of a function is illustrated by examples.\nA rule describing a function\ncan be represented by an equation or formula, a table or a graph, which are recorded as\nordered pairs. The evaluation of a function is to find a number that is paired with a given\nnumber.\nExample 1.5.14 To evaluate the function f(x) = 3x + 2 at x = 2, we need the number\nf(2). Since f(x) = 3x + 2, replace x by 2 in the expression for the function and simplify.\nThus f(2) = 3 × 2 + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8. Therefore the ordered pair is (2, 8). We write f(2) = 8\nor 2 →8. This is the y value in the expression by y = 3x + 2 when x = 2.\nExample 1.5.15\nLet f(x) = x2 + 6x + 2 Find the value of\n(a) f(0)\n(b) f(−2)\n(c) f(1)\n(d) f(x + 1)\n(e) f(n −2)\n(a) f(0) = 02 + 6(0) + 2 = 2.
