Introduction\nThis is the chapter which presents background of the study, purpose of the study,\nresearch questions and statement of the problem, significance and scope of the\nstudy.\n1.1. Background to the study\nAt one time, technology has been cited as the greatest threat to small and mediumsized businesses (SMEs) globally. Needless to say that technology can never be\nsubstituted in making things efficient, precise, abundant, and affordable. But the\nmajority of SMEs lack the resources to invest in the decent backend technologies and\nthere is limited access to decent infrastructures as the Internet. The rest make\ninvestments in inefficient technology, or fail to make investments and forfeit their\nfuture opportunities to grow and compete (Rosenberg, 2019).\nA cell phone is a miniaturized personal computer that has a miniaturized touchscreen\nto write on and miniaturized screen to read and see. People were once used to call\nand hear each other without a wire in old cellular telephones, however, currently,\npeople can surf each other anywhere and everywhere using the third-generation (3G)\ncellular phones other than words. The presence of cellular phones is everywhere and\nthe common services offered include mobile phone call, mobile instant messaging,\nMobile money transfer, mobile bill payment, mobile internet surfing and, most\nrecently, mobile banking. Francis and Willard (2016) unveiled that SMEs can solve\nsome of their issues with the help of smartphones and even improve their\nperformance. In the last ten years, smartphones have penetrated the whole market of\nthe developing world.\nNew service is also present since MNOs offer capacity in a competitive environment to\ncomplementary services to SMS and voice such that the final goals are to minimize\nchurn and increase customer retention (Ndiwalana, Morawczynski, & Popov, 2007). In\nthis regard, SMEs-third world business enterprises are incurring significant expenses in", "word_count": 301, "start_char": 8997, "end_char": 10968}

The online financial service enabled through the presence\nof a telephony network that is mobile money enables companies to increase access to\nfinancial data and make sound choices (Okundaye, et al., 2019). The companies can,\ne.g., access real-time financial details, track transactions and examine how\ncustomers make payments via mobile money channels.\nBy adopting these recommendations, companies can effectively make budgetary\ndecisions, cash management and full utilization of the available resources, which\nleads to overall performance. Mobile money will transform the manner in which firms\nwill deal with their customers and suppliers since it is an easy and secure way of\npayment. Under mobile money, the firms will be able to make payments efficiently\nwithout agglomeration and therefore enhance efficiency and cost of doing business\nwill be minimized. As an illustration, financial settlement has become easy and fast\nas the businesses use mobile money platforms to remit the suppliers or transfer\nbetween the customers. It allows the business to enhance the better partnership\nrelationships and business operating in day-to-day operation. Its subscribers are also\nincreasing because of the rivalry with 5 MNOS-MTN Uganda, warid telecom Uganda\nbefore Airtel, and other institutions. In addition, the cellular phone subscribers of all\nthe MNOs number about 9.9 million in the first quarter of 2010 and help in pushing up\nthe mobile network penetration TO 31.4 per capita to national tele-destiny of 32.2\nlines of national telecommunication sector. Mobile money is novel: ten years ago, it\nwas very scarcely discussed.\n\nThe initial unbanked in 2001, but perhaps the milestone achievement by kenya in\n2007 of the M-pesa system that introduced mobile money into the international\nmedia(Aron 2016)Mobile money and mobile telephone penetration facilitates business\ncommunication and enables business to spend its capital more effectively (Okundaye,\net al., 2019).\nMobile money platforms are used in business to optimize the cash management,\naugment liquidity and administrative sophistication.

This saves time as well as\nprovides additional security and transparency and hence enhances capital utilization\nand performance. Skillful use of the mobile money technology helps the firms to\nincrease the market share and enhance market reach (Willard, 2016; Owoseni and\nTwinomurinzi, 2020). Mobile money is an alternative payment system that helps the\nbusiness to access a larger customer base besides an expanded geographical reach.\nAs an illustration, companies that use mobile money as a mode of payment will be\nable to take advantage of consumers who may wish to make real-time payments\nonline, hence increasing market share and turnover. Mobile money is also able to\nexpand businesses which would otherwise be closed to business by capitalizing on\ncustomers who might be far off to the mass market banking products. Once again in\nUganda the financial health of Small and Micro enterprises is that of Uganda (Auditor\nGeneral's Report, 2017). There are still reports of no attempt being made by these\nfirms to sell and make a profit and thereby jeopardize their survival even as interest\nin these institutions grows among the Government of Uganda and other development\nstakeholders (BOU, 2018; PSFU, 2017).\nTo illustrate the point, existing statistics have indicated that less than 30 percent of\n100 start-ups makes it to the second year of operation to record the various sections\nof Uganda (UIA, 2017). The large publicity of the mobile money service providers as\nabove was accompanied with a lot of convenience, and the service proved efficient\nand reliable as long as money transfer was concerned with the agentcustomer\ninterface operating with minimal customer complaints. This also remains true since\nthe agents are still expanding as they continue to add more banking products to the\nmobile money platform. All these extra services will equally find the agents with\ncertain degrees of literacy and demands in an effort to enable the extra services.\nMore people in Uganda are shifting to the mobile money services since mobile phone\nservices are still being used more.\nOne can even dare to bet that it is now convenient to transact most of the\ntransactions using mobile money rather than money.

This paper examined the mobile money technology by analyzing\ndiscourses of the nature of the nature of mobile financial services and mobile phone\ncommunication.

The central division of Mukono\nMunicipality SMEs are experiencing a series of problems that include; the high cost of\noperation, most of the operators are illiterate and lack business experience and the\nfact that most of the traders are offering the same product and service provision thus\nfailure and collapse of the SMEs operation hence the need to know whether the\nmobile money technology and comforts adoption and utilization will help the SMEs\noperation. This paper reviewed the mobile money technology by studying discourses\nof the nature of the nature of mobile financial services and mobile phone\ncommunication. The simplest of the issues are the mistakes on the entry of the\ncustomers. This fact compels SMEs to have reasons behind doing business in a venture\nin an attempt to realize utmost efficiency and enhanced business development as\nomwansa (2009) argues. 1.2.\nProblem Statement The mobile money is identified to support the business of the\nSMEs as it is subscribable at high levels in Uganda since its introduction in\n2009.Satisfaction due to affordability because they can afford it even at low income\nearners. Technology innovation was documented as user friendly and efficient and\ndependable with potential of increasing financial services to the consumers of lowcost financial services. It is not suitable technology innovation SMEs cannot be\ncompetitive in the environment of limited cheap and easily available finance services\nto carry out business operations that SMEs demand in sectors of payment and\ntransactional services that are by no means well served by traditional banks due to\ntheir unprofitable nature in offering a broad range of banking services (Higgins,\nKendall and Lyon, 2012). The Uganda estimates show that there are more than 20\nmillion mobile money subscribers, which translate to approximately eighty percent of\nthe number of money transactors who use cell phones and all of them consider the\nconvenience attractive (Aron and Muellbauer, 2019).\nCell phone technology has been considered the key to unlocking business potential\nand high performance and impact and thus, so much potential can be used to unlock\nthe performance of SMEs using cell phones as it facilitates the entrepreneur to\ncommunicate over distances and convey information at a time.\n\n1.3.

The data was collected using e-Journals, reports, dissertations,\ntext books, and paper presentations, in university libraries and documentation\ncenters.\n2.1 Implication of mobile money Mobile payments and SMEs performance.\nPresence of enabling environment was a major determinant of how much the use of\nmobile payments would affect the performance (Porteous, 2006).\nThe Mobile Money application is very wide-ranging and needs an enabling environment\nto ensure the success of the beneficiaries. These micro businesses are highly\ndiversified all over the country with colossal concentrations both in the market areas\nand along the shopping stake. This is to provide convenience so that the agents can\naccess the Mobile Money providers to sign up and to deposit money in their accounts.\nThe agents of the mobile payment providers are also well distributed and can be\navailable to the micro business owners to offer their services in the Mukono\nmunicipality. Mobile wallet allows the subscriber to send or pay money anywhere,\neverywhere and at any time. Money transfer feature is the ability of the individual to\ntransfer money in their mobile money account to another subscriber in any place and\nat any time as the case of airtime transfer where the individual can buy airtime and\nsend it to another subscriber on the same network.

Mobile transactions began with the prepaid cell phone service that was\noffered to low-income callers who wanted to enjoy a high degree of anonymity\ncompared to the post-paid ones. Prepaid callers would go to an outlet, buy small\ndenominations of airtime and dial the information in after which they would make the\ndesired call unlike in post-paid cell phone service. This number of mobile subscribers\nbecame so big within a short period of time that they could be targeted by micropayment companies since most of them had no or restricted access to banks. Wishart\n(2006) provided the best reason why this group of people occurred and financial\nproducts needed to be developed to meet their needs; it was in the trend of a\ncashless society with the following benefits; fraud reduction, fraud eradication, the\ncost of cash processing reduced and less dependency on cash-in-hand when the\nsituation arose. Must and Ludewig (2010) attribute the mobile money innovation to\nincreased and global spread of mobile phones after 1999. Nonetheless, services with\nthe assistance of a mobile phone may have begun as early as 1997 when mobile phone\nfacilitated vending machines of Coco Cola and mobile phone facilitated banking in\nFinland went online. Other cellular business services mentioned above include the\nlaunching of SMART money by a Filipino mobile company in 1999. By the year 2000,\nmobile money technology already had begun to have spread to the list of other\ncountries. In 2004, GLOBE Telecom rolled out G-cash (Wishart, 2006). In India, Bharti\nAirtel had introduced a pilot mobile money transfer project in 2007 (Bosi, Celly and\nJoshi, 2011). Omwansa (2009) had shown that mobile money transfer customers have\nembraced the technology because accessing the services in the bank hall will be\ncheaper. He describes that money transfer using mobile phone is cheaper than bank\nand other money transfer systems such as securical companies.\nThe benefit of the reduced transaction cost is transferred to the customers (Mallat,\n2007). The majority of SMEs owners have easy-to-use mobile handsets with all the\nfeatures required in mobile banking due to which they have low transaction cost and\nlower than banks are charging.

Wanyonyi and Bwisa (2013)\nestablished the Effect of mobile money transfer services to the performance of the\nSMEs.\nThey determined that the SMEs use mobile money transfer in: B2B (business to\nbusiness) transfer whereby they purchase with suppliers and C2B (customer to the\nbusiness) transfer whereby the customers purchase with the business and which\nconsequently led to enhanced performance of the micro enterprises.\nNevertheless, Wamuyu, et al. (2011) found minimal application of mobile money\ntransfer in B2B and B2C transactions compared to C2C and C2B e-commerce\ntransactions through application of mobile money transfer, and the impact of mobile\ninternet services on the performance of SMEs is significantly positive. Mbogo (2010)\nhas developed the success factors by adopting the mobile payments by the Microbusiness operators and has concluded that the access to the money transfer\ntechnology to be used and the accessibility, affordability, support and security issues\nare correlated with behavioral intention to use and use of the mobile payment\nservices by micro businesses to realize success and growth. The report of Financial\nSector Deepening Kenya (2009) states that when the clients of M-Pesa were requested\nto make a comparison with their previous national money transfer service more than\n95% of the clients said that M-Pesa was faster, more convenient, safer and cheaper.\nAt the time of research, Safaricom was providing the service to 4420279 clients\nthrough 4781 MPesa agents.\nIt had the coverage of 887 bank halls and 1,424 ATMs in the country.

It is a clear sign of a premium value attached to the\nconvenience it brings about through the use of the mobile payment services.\nAccording to Omwansa (2009), losing a mobile phone is not a disaster and the fact\nthat the mobile phone has been stolen is not a disaster in that no one can access an\nM-Pesa account without a legitimate personal identification number (PIN). He goes on\nto say that in a nation where most of the citizens lack bank accounts, M-Pesa offers\ncomfort and security. Having their virtual money, people know that they can retrieve\nit at any time at a very minimal fee.\n2.2. Performance communication Mobile phone marketing and SMEs.\nWith mobile phones, consumers can now access detailed product or service\ninformation in the point-of-sale to enable them in making informed buying decision at\nthat point (Mort & Drennan, 2002).\nSmall and medium companies can easily create brand recall and awareness using push\nadvertisements via SMS marketing.\nAdvertising through sending promotional messages enables the consumer to see the\nbusiness organization most of the time since messages will be delivered to the target\non a virtual basis every time. Messages are stored in the memory of the mobile phones\nwhen they are delivered to the consumers and could be re-read at the convenience of\nthe customers. The subject line that is seen in e-mail does not exist in SMS. It is\nagainst this reason that it will be read first then deleted (Rettie et al., 2005). Viral\nmarketing also takes place through SMS (Doyle, 2000), which also holds importance to\nSMEs brands not only in the increased brand awareness but also peer influence (Scharl\net al., 2005). It is possible to target one to one mobile phone messages depending on\nthe individual preference. They are therefore more important to the consumer than\nthe non-personalised messages.

The other fact that contributes to the potential of mobile phones in\nmarketing is the two-way communication. The two-way communication offered by\nmobile phones is better than any other device due to the always on connection\nfeatures, as well as the ability to set up within a short time. Using the cell phones,\nthe SMEs can market products or services relative to regions to their prospective\ncustomers.\nIt has been estimated that location marketing will create a lot of business\nopportunities in the future, especially considering new technologies such as Bluetooth\nand RFID (radio frequency identification) (Komulainen, et al 2004).\nThe SMEs are better positioned to capitalize on the use of mobile technology in\nproviding location-based product or service offers to customers and this will result in\nincreased traffic into the local stores with an immediate purchase (Bauer et al., 2005;\nKannan, Chang, and Whinston, 2001). Mobile technology provides small and medium\nsize enterprises with the opportunity of providing individual and interactive products\nand services. The advertisement text may be customized on a mix up of demographic\ndata, purchase pattern, setting and location (Clarke, 2001; Varshney and Vetter,\n2002). Due to the fact that the mobile phone is with its user at all times, the media\ngives the small and medium-sized businesses relatively reliable chances to target the\npotential consumers directly. The mobile phone enables the customer to be contacted\nby (or contact) the businesses anywhere and at any time, in real time. This becomes\nnecessary especially when time or place sensitive information is needed to be\nexchanged (Anckar & D'Incau, 2002). In other words, the mobile phone facilitates\nconnectedness of consumers. Second, the mobile phone helps in two-way\ncommunication. Its monetary worth is that it is able to establish closer customer\nrelationships. One of the major aspects of mobile technology is the ability to provide\nproducts or services that customers need and desire (Bovee, Houston and Thill, 1995;\nKotler and Armstrong, 2006).\nThis is why small and medium firms develop database.", "word_count": 380, "start_char": 34795, "end_char": 37250}

The end result is on the delivery of\ncustomized products to individual customers, based on individual customer wants and\nwants. Directed communication also results in favorable consumer views regarding the\nproducts they purchase (Xu, 2007), to increase in campaign response rate (Barutcu,\n2007), and to an improvement in company-client relationship (Vesanen, 2007). The\nCustomer Relation Management (CRM) has everything to do with one of the other core\nimpacts of mobiles on the customer. Kannan et al. (2001) have postulated four\nqualities that make the mobile media an ideal media in CRM: the capacity to convey\npersonal content, the capacity to trace consumers to other media, the capacity to\nprovide service to customers at the time needed, and the capacity to provide content\nwith very engaging features. On the same note, Sinisalo, Salo, Karjaluoto and\nLeppaniemi (2007) stated that the most relevant characteristics of the mobile\nmedium to CRM are personalization, interactivity and flexibility. In some countries\nlike Italy, mobile customer relationship management services are already\nimplemented and most of the services are installed in the after sales services with the\nobjective of achieving maximum customer satisfaction (Valsecchi, Renga, & Rangone,\n2007).\nCompetition in the market determines the customer relationship and customer\nsatisfaction. To serve its customers, companies have to design, develop, and deliver\nproducts and services that will meet their needs, both physical and non-physical,\nmore than its competitors and create greater value. Companies offer quality aftersales and other services to retain and own customers and to have their loyalty\n(Monga, 2000). ICT is taking centre stage in the development of the customer\nrelations management (CRM) practices.

Managerial survey and case study\nresearch indicate that the most significant ICT investment determinants include\nproduct quality improvement most of all improvements in customer service, speed,\nand ease (Bresnahan et al., 2002) Small and medium enterprises in developing\ncountries are adopting mobile technology as a means of increasing their business\nopportunities. The advantages that it had on the small and medium-sized enterprises\nthat operate with mobile phones as mentioned by a 2012 World Bank report are the\navailability of business information regarding stock piles and prices, the availability of\ndata to enable value chain efficiency, and the possibility to reach existing markets\nand new markets. By availing price and product information to the small and medium\nsized enterprises, this assists them to avoid the risk of selling below value as well as\noversupply and under-supply of their goods in a particular market. The world bank\nstudy notes that through availability of price information to the small and mediumsized business, this has helped to boost agricultural incomes by 24%. Suppliers also are\nearning even greater returns of 57% as the total price decreases to the customers at\napproximately 4%. The mobiles may also facilitate increased market access, and other\nplayers in the value chain.\nThe suppliers are also becoming more inclined to provide on-line information on\nlogistics and transportation on their sites and some of these are even provided on\nmobiles. An example is that through voice and short message service (SMS) in\nMorocco, the small and medium-sized business enters the bargaining power of the\nlocal truckers to ensure that they can better transverse merchandise and to\ndetermine where it is most appropriate to them to sell the merchandise. Two-way\ntrade services other small and medium-sized businesses are also involving transporting\ngoods between the big regional markets and their rural home territories where they\nresell to the rural areas, which is determined by the promotion activities and\nobjectives of M-Banking service providers (Njenga, 2009, 2.3).

This would enable the banks to broaden their revenue bases with\nthe large volumes of transactions.\n2.3 The impact of Mobile Money.\nThe issue of the developing world in researching on mobile money has centered\naround the developing world and has determined that the accessibility of finance by\nmobile money is synonymous to poverty eradication and better financial inclusion\n(Must and Ludewig, 2010).\nSome scholars have voiced an opinion that mobile money is an expandable means of\noffering financial services to the developing world and case studies of some African\ncountries such as Must and Ludewig (2010) prove the same. This has been possible due\nto a few reasons including cheaper and easier remittance of money to the home\ncountry, higher coverage and access to micro-loans, reduction in the costs of saving\namong others of financial services SMEs requirement. Inter-Media (2010) indicates\nthat only 99% of the subscribers use the mobile money service to send or receive\nmoney, with the other 1% using it to do other things such as credit or loan\narrangements. M-banking itself is a mobile money service which has been able to offer\nbasic banking and electronic services to the unbanked customers (Anderson, 2010).\nMobile money continues to have many effects on individuals and households. In the\nattempt to measure the impact of M-Pesa on human freedom, Donovan (2011)\nconducted a research in Kenya on M-Pesa.\nHe ensured that a social network connection, a want and need to financially organize\nwith businesses, friends and family members and progressive elimination of all other\noptions including the Western Money Union and banks creates a type of power that\ninfluences all Kenyan M-Pesa users and non-users.\nMoreover, the factor that mobile money plays in ensuring that household can also\nsmooth risk due to decreased transaction costs in contrast to non-mobile-money\nhouseholds that will consume less in the end due to an unfavorable income shock", "word_count": 400, "start_char": 41835, "end_char": 44310}

Mobile phones can also be used as economic development tool.\nThere is a possibility that they may affect consumer and producer welfare and general\neconomic development in developing countries, but the effects of M money plans on\nmicroeconomics and macroeconomics performance is a research area (Jenny and\nIsaac, 2010). So far (Nasikye, 2009), Mobile banking (m-banking) refers to a mobile\nphone or any other mobile handset to perform a financial transaction related to a\ncustomer account. M-banking, according to (Owen, 2008) can be defined as the\ndelivery and provision of bank and financial services through a mobile\ntelecommunication gadget. These services can encompass checking the balance,\naccount transactions, payroll, credit request and other banking services through a\nmobile gadget like the mobile phone that is widely prevalent in the developing\ncountries, or Personal Digital Assistant (PDA).\nNyaga (2013) also studied the effects of mobile money services on the performance of\nSMEs and affirmed that the application of mobile money has assisted to a significant\nlevel in the SME sector.\nFirstly, most of the traders trust it more than the conventional bank system when\nexecuting their daily transactions. Secondly, the proprietors of SMEs are conversant\nwith the rudimentary business activities of the mobile money services as well. The\nbanking services offer the support to both the clients and the businesses in paying\ntheir transactions. Mobile banking is a new trend as opposed to the traditional\nbanking services where banking services are offered through a network known as\nbranchless banking.\nThrough this new technology, microenterprises use transactional and information\nservices.\nThe information on account balance and transaction notifications is also easily\naccessible.", "word_count": 312, "start_char": 44072, "end_char": 46130}

The use of mobile banking dispels the risk of holding\ncash thereby saving time and transport costs, which are likely to be encountered by\nSMEs in the traditional banking. The services being available locally allow the SMEs\ntime to focus on running the business as far as possible thereby saving on the\noperation cost (Otiso et al., 2013; Jagun, et al., 2008).\nThe mobile banking services are the supplements to the traditional banking services\nand their usage cannot be restricted by time and space. The services entail minor\nroutine transactions the convenience of which is consolidated by exploiting the\nmobile banking services. Otiso et al. (2013) confirmed that the percentage of SMEs\nusing mobile banking is more than the traditional banking. The mobile phones also\nprovide information and transactional services to SMEs. Mobile banking will allow the\nSMEs to receive the bank service as inquiry through a bank account and mini\nstatement.

Introduction\nThe chapter presents a research design that will be used in the research. It presents\nthe study design, research population, study area, sample size and sampling\nprocedure, type of data and source of data and data collection procedure. It also\npresents data analysis procedures of the study.\n3.1. Research Design\nResearch design is a theoretical plan of conducting research and in the current\nresearch, descriptive survey research design will be used. According to Kothari (2022),\ndescriptive surveys provide the researcher with the ability to provide a clear and\nprecise description of the study participants. The method records data on numerous\ncohorts at a single instance, and off of it, one can get the general information on a\nvariety of diverse views. Thus, the research focuses on diversity and context of\nlearning among the population.\n3.2. Target Population\nThe target population is the group of which the outcomes of the research are going to\nbe extrapolated (Cooper and Schindler, 2020). Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) of\nMukano Municipality and the mobile money service owners were the target of the\nstudy. Statistics provided by Department of Trade, Industry, and Local Economic\nDevelopment reveal that there are 150 small businesses in Mukino Municipality that\ninclude mini supermarkets, hardware shops, stationery shops, boutique shops, retail\nshops, and restaurants.\n3.3. Sample Size and Sampling Method.\nThe following is the sample of the research. The sample size was calculated on the\nMorgan table basis; according to Krejcie and Morgan (2020), the sample size of 80 was\ncalculated when the population of the respondents is 100. The study will therefore\nconsider 80 SMEs within Mukino Municipality and purposive sampling will be easily\nutilized.", "word_count": 329, "start_char": 47296, "end_char": 49406}

Data Collection Methods\nThe research utilized both a secondary data and collected information through peerreviewed journals and primary data that was collected directly by the researcher by\nadministering a questionnaire to the participants.\n3.4.1. Data Collection Instrument\nPrimary Data\nThe data were collected by use of survey questionnaire which is primary data. The\nquestionnaire survey is suitable to gather information in social research (Kaplan,\n2020), especially when the target population under study is literate and is able to\nrespond to the questionnaire (Moser, 2020). Open and structured questions will be in\nexistence. The systematic one will be easy to analyze by tabulation of frequency and\npercentage.\nSecondary Data\nThe secondary data were gathered based on the available reports and journals on\nmobile money technology and the performance of SMEs. Other relevance studies that\nhad been carried out by other scholars on the same topic were also utilized.\n3.5. Research Instruments Reliability and Validity.\nReliability\nQualitative research reliability is the aspect of research design that rarely receives\nthe kind of attention it deserves in research design practice; it is acceptable to\npresuppose questioning one of his/her reliability in research as a crime (Kirk and\nMiller, 2020). The result of the qualitative interviews will be reliable when the data\ncollection and analysis are conducted by a single individual as in this study. The\nreliability of the instrument will be checked through the consistency in measuring\nsimilar variable on many different occasions in order to give the same result.", "word_count": 303, "start_char": 49062, "end_char": 51034}

In the case of formal interviews, one is restricted in\ncommunication whereas in qualitative interview one can inquire into clarification of\nthe meaning. The validity purposes and instruments created will be reviewed by a\nsupervisor and then pilot survey will be conducted. Data collection will be done using\ncontent validity in which the researcher establishes indicators that are applicable to\nthe concept of measurement. One of the samples of mobile money services and SME\nperformance measure will be chosen.\n3.6. Analysis of Data\nThe data obtained will be analyzed descriptively by using the Microsoft Excel software\nin which the frequencies and percentages of demographic information where\nperformed on the respondents. The responses of the questionnaires will also be\nanalyzed qualitatively by using only the suitable data collected.\n3.7. Ethical Issues\nData collection was possible because a cover letter of the survey by the Uganda\nChristian University, School of Business provided room to collect data. The subject\nrespondents will be given questionnaires and all of them will be assured of\nconfidentiality and appropriate introduction. Report writing will be undertaken after\ntwo days when the questionnaires are collected.\n3.8. Study Limitations\nIt will not generalize the findings of the research since the research is currently\nfocusing on Mukono Municipality.

The results are provided\nbased on the descriptive statistics. The results are in accordance with the research\nobjectives and research variables. The research starts with the background accounts\nof the respondents and research objective investigation.\n4.2 Background Information of Respondents.\nIt can be seen in the sex of the respondents, the age bracket, the level of education\nattained, the number of years they had been in business, their group of occupation\nand the category of their ownership, number of staff and the number of their outlets.\n4.2.1 Gender of the Respondents\nThe respondents were requested to indicate their genders and their findings on the\nsame are presented in table.\nTable 4.1: Gender of the Respondents.\nMale 39\n48.75\nFemale\n51.25\n100.0\nAccording to Table 4.1, 48.75 percent of the respondents were males and 51.25\npercent were female. This means that there are more women than men in the\nrespondents a fact that has an implication that most of the SMEs in Nakawa Central\nDivision are run by women. It also has the implication that women are the ones who\nuse mobile money services more than their male counterparts do.\n\n4.2.2 Age of the Respondents\nThe frequencies and percentages of the age distribution of the respondents were\ncalculated by the researcher. These are the results as presented in Table 4.2 below:\nTable 4.2: Age of the Respondents\nAge\nFrequency\nPercentage\nBelow 25\n30.00\n26-35 30\n37.50\n36-45 18\n22.50\n46-55 8\n10.00\n100.0\n\nThese findings also indicate that the numbers of the respondents (37.50) who are\naged 26-35 years are higher and 30.00% of them are less than 25 years. 22.50% are 36-\n45 years. 10.00% are 46-55 years. This is an indication of owners in the SMEs that are\nwithin the 26-35 years. This is explicable since most of the SMEs are established by\nyoung people who desire to begin their business early in life. Mobile money services\ntherefore seem to be the most used by this population as they represent the greatest\nmajority of the respondents.\n4.2.4 Level of Education of the respondents.\nThis study addressed level of education of the respondents in the event of SME\nentrepreneurs. The results of the outcomes are indicated in Table 4.4:", "word_count": 442, "start_char": 52539, "end_char": 55217}

This is an indication of the owners\nin SMEs to be between the ages of 26-35 years. This can be attributed to the fact that\nmost of the SMEs are established by young people who desire to commence their own\nbusiness at a young age. Mobile money services thus seem to be the most used by this\ngroup of people as they constitute the largest majority of the respondents.\n4.4 The Impact of Mobile Finance on SMEs\nThis was one of the main objectives of the study, and they were requested to tick\ntheir view regarding the impact of mobile finance on SME performance. The findings\nare presented in Table 4.11 below:\n\nTable 4.11: Descriptive Statistics on the Influence of Mobile Finance on SMEs\nStd.\nMobile finance has enabled me to gain\nenough finance for my business\n5.00\n3.3259 1.41894\nThrough the use of mobile finance, I am\nable\nto\naccess\nloans\nfrom\nfinancial\ninstitutions\n5.00\n3.3426 1.23925\nAccess to mobile finance enables my quick\nresponse to customers' needs\n5.00\n3.2593 1.36286\nThe presence of mobile finance relieves me\nof the problem of having to open a bank\naccount\n5.00\n3.5630 1.17351\nThrough mobile finance, I am able to save\nmoney from my business proceedings\n5.00\n3.3241 1.16674\n\n3.36298 1.060217", "word_count": 325, "start_char": 54886, "end_char": 56798}

The mean standard deviation\nof 1.060217 demonstrates that there is a certain fluctuation in responses on this\nassertion.\nThe researchers concluded that mobile finance has helped SMEs to acquire adequate\nfinancing as evidenced by a mean of 3.3259. But the standard deviation of 1.41894,\ncorresponding, implies that there might be diverse responses, that is, some of the\nrespondents might be doubtful about this assertion. These findings are consistent with\nthe study by Govil et al. (2014) who observed that mobile finance improves economic\nperformance and growth of businesses.\nBased on the survey, the respondents affirmed that mobile finance enables them to\ntake loans with the financial institutions which is demonstrated by the mean value of\n3.3426. A standard deviation of 1.23925 shows that there is variation in responses,\nwhich confirms the findings of Kakwa (2012), who stated that SMEs have access to\ncredit using mobile finance to cater to short-term business requirements.\nThe respondents were also in agreement with the fact that mobile finance provides\nthe ability to respond to customer needs within a short duration as indicated by a\nmean of 3.2593. The standard deviation of 1.36286 implies the presence of divergent\nopinions, which means that mobile finance helps SMEs to react quickly to customer\nrequirements, in line with Kakwa (2012).\nResults of the survey indicate a mean of 3.5630 meaning that the respondents agree\nthat mobile finance relieves an individual of the burden of opening a bank account.\nNonetheless, the standard deviation of 1.17351 reflects that there are mixed\nresponses. This is an indicator that mobile finance offers an alternative option that\nSMEs can use to manage their finances.\n\nLastly, the discussion shows that the mean of 3.3241 is that the respondents agree\nthat mobile finance is useful in saving them money in the course of business\ntransactions. The standard deviation of 1.16674 shows that there is a little variation\nin the opinions, which agree with Kakwa (2012) who observed that mobile finance\nhelps SMEs to save and access credit.\n4.5 The Impact of Mobile Banking with regards to SMEs.\nThis was among the major goals of the research, which focused on establishing the\nimpact of mobile banking on SMEs.

The mean deviation of 1.17972 implies that they respond differently and that\nalthough a good portion of them agree to this, some people might be unsure of this\nability. These results are in line with the findings made by Ishengoma (2011) who\nreported that mobile banking simplified withdrawal and deposits.\nThe analysis shows that the respondents are able to deposit in their bank accounts\nthrough mobile banking which is shown by the mean of 3.0463.

The fact that\nthe standard deviation of 1.068122 shows that there is a variation in responses is in\nline with Nyaga (2013) who established that information about account balance can\nbe readily obtained through the mobile banking platforms.\nIt was also found out that the respondents are able to request bank statements using\ntheir phones which have a mean value of 3.3704.

The\nmean normal deviation of 1.290003 depicts some difference in the feedback\nconcerning the success of these services.\nAccording to the respondents, the accessibility of credit facilities by using mobile\nmoney has enabled them to access adequate capital to grow their businesses as\ndepicted by the mean value of 2.9722. The standard deviation 1.25645 indicates\ndivergent views; there are still respondents who are uncertain. The findings are\nconsistent with Atieno (2009) findings that indicated that financial resources should\nbe made available to facilitate successful performance of SMEs.\nThe analysis reveals that the number of employees in the businesses has increased, as\nthe mean value of 3.2130 reveals. Nevertheless, the values of the standard deviation\n1.20785 indicate diversity in the answers of the participants.\nAlso, the respondents noted that the profits increased after embracing the mobile\nmoney services, which is represented by a mean of 3.7037. The standard deviation of\n1.03454 indicates different experiences which is in line with Mboga (2010), who said\nthat mobile money encourages entrepreneurship and boosts small enterprise growth.\nThe respondents also concurred in the fact that mobile money services offer\nalternative sources of credit which was originally challenging to access as indicated by\na mean of 3.0463. The value of standard deviation of 1.42333 demonstrates that there\nis some variation in experiences, which supports the claim by Guagraw (2007) that\nmobile financial transactions improve the efficiency of microfinance.\n\nTable 4.14: Mobile Money Services Relationship and influence on SMEs.\n\nCorrelations\nMobile Money Services Effect of SMEs\nMobile Money Services Pearson Correlation\n\nSig.
