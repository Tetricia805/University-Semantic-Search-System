Definition of motivation according to Society for Human Resource Management\n(2010), motivation is generally defined as the psychological forces that determine the direction\nof a person’s level of effort, as well as a person’s persistence in the face of obstacles. Bratton et\nal. (2007) defined it as a cognitive decision making process that influences the persistence and\ndirection of goal directed behavior. Furthermore, Armstrong (2004) states that employee welfare\nprograms rest mainly on the abstract ground of social responsibility on organizations for those\nwho work for them.\nJennifer and George (2006) defined employee productivity as the level of effort put forth by the\nworkforce of an organization towards achieving organizational goals and objectives. There are\nseveral ways by which a workforce can be motivated so as to enhance organizational\nproductivity. In spite of all these apparent attendant problems of motivation, and productivity,\nevery organization do necessarily seek means of ensuring continuous productivity, which would\nbe geared towards the accomplishment of organization goals. The organizational system under\nstudy cannot be said to be different in any way, in terms of producing the results for which it was\nset up. In all these processes the private organization and indeed the banking industry has thus\nhelped to make Ghana the country it is today.\nMotivation/ staff welfare is one of the most important concepts of psychology and very vital for\nmanagers who direct the growth of their subordinates towards worthwhile goals (Adnan, 2005).\nManagers according to Ali, Abrar&Haider (2012) rank motivation of employees as the most\nserious problem that confronts them in the instruction of subordinates. This transfer of control is\nbest supported by an organizational environment that is “organized to encourage and support a", "word_count": 403, "start_char": 10406, "end_char": 13575}

In spite of all apparent problems of motivation and productivity, organizations\nseek means of ensuring continuous productivity, which would be geared towards the\naccomplishment of organizational goals.\nArmstrong (2004) states that employee welfare programs rest mainly on the abstract ground of\nsocial responsibility on organizations for those who work for them. Organizations need highly\nperforming employees in order to meet their goals to deliver the products and services they\nspecialize in and hence achieve competitive advantage. According to Gayle and Brock (2004)\norganizations provide welfare facilities to their employees to keep their motivation levels high.\nThe employee welfare programs can be classified into two categories viz. statutory and nonstatutory welfare schemes (Cole, 2002).\nGlobally, organization can easily change their material, needs, goods and services with one\nanother. But the only one resource which is not easily exchangeable is human resources.\nTherefore, human resources are the very important or most competitive assets of organizations\nthat cannot be exchangeable. So the motivation and welfare are main factors that affect the\nproductivity if human resources of the organization (Azar and Shafighi, 2013). According to the\nWebsite- Business Growth journal, (2014), there are certain monetary and non-monetary\nmotivational strategies already applied by Tesco such as free shares after a certain period of\nemployment, employee pension schemes, employee discount cards, private healthcare facility,\nand gym memberships are especially highlighted and those are non-monetary motivation\nstrategies adapted by Tesco already. In each year Tesco employees are allowed to communicate\nany motivational factors or inequality matters that they face. This has helped to greatly improve\nemployee performance in Tesco.\nIn Africa according to the work of Akerele (1991), it was observed that poor remuneration is\nrelated to profits made by organizations. Wage gap between high and low income earners was\nrelated to the low morale, lack of commitment and low productivity. In addition, Nwachukwu\n(2014) blamed the productivity of Ugandan workers on several factors, among them is\nemployer’s failure to provide adequate compensation for hard work and the indiscipline of the\nprivileged class that arrogantly displays their wealth, which is very demoralizing to working", "word_count": 401, "start_char": 13294, "end_char": 16074}

Judging from all these empirical studies and\nfindings, one may generally conclude that a good remuneration package, which ties financial\nrewards to individual performance, can be expected to result in higher productivity.\nIn Uganda, staff motivation has evolved from being limited to staff training under the colonial\nauthority in the early 1920s to being multidimensional today (Busingye, 2015). The limited\nfinancial resources Uganda has to prevent it from implementing best practices and enhancing\npublic sector human resource management remains a major goal for enhancing service delivery.\nTherefore, to adapt to the shifting performance requirements brought on by globalization and\nmodernization, the Hoima District Local Government (HDLG) has long used training of its staff\nin the form of induction, on-the-job, and off-the-job training (HDLG, 2016).\nCentury Bottling Company came into existence in 1886 may by Dr. John StythPermberton, a\npharmacist in Atlanta Georgia, U.S.A coca cola was established in Uganda in the year 1953 with\nits first plant at Namanve but presently coca cola has over 193 plants whole over the world.\nDespite all the efforts Century Bottling Company has consistently made to facilitate their\nemployees, workers’ productivity is still low. Lack of proper strategies for motivation and\nwelfare for employees in the company has been noted as one of the major threats which forms\nthe need to carry out this research.\n1.2 Problem statement\nMotivation and welfare is about giving your staff the right mixture of guidance, direction,\nresources and rewards so that they are inspired and keen to work in the way that you want them\nto (Ludhans, 2012). Staff members are some of the most valuable assets therefore retaining\nmotivated staff builds businesses and also reduces the cost of recruitment and training.\nAccording to Mullins (2005), effectively motivating employees and providing them with better\nwelfare benefits is one of the most important functions of an organization. However, there is\nevidence to show that organizations are facing challenges in achieving productivity due to\nlimited opportunities for advancement given to employees, little pay, poor working conditions\nand lack of job security among others.

It highlights specific arguments and ideas in the field of\nstudy. The researcher presented arguments and attempt to show what has been studied in the\nfield on the impact of staff motivation on organizational productivity. It demonstrates to the\nreader why the research is useful, necessary, and valid.\n2.1 Concepts of key variables\n2.1.1 Staff Motivation\nThere has been various definitions of motivation across different disciplines in the academia\nranging from the fields of management, psychology to allied sciences. According to Ramlall\n(2004), motivation is derived from the Latin word “mover” which means to move. Butkus and\nGreen (1999) also stated that motivation is derived from the word “motivate” which also means\nto move, push or persuade to act to satisfy a need.\nRobbins (2005) defined motivation as the “willingness to exert high levels of effort toward\norganizational goals, conditioned by the effort’s ability to satisfy some individual need”.\nAccording to Robbins (2005), a need is an internal state that makes certain outcomes appears\nattractive and an unsatisfied need creates tension that stimulates drives within an individual.\nStaff motivation is one of the policies of managers to increase effectiveness of job management\namongst employees in organizations (Shadare et al, 2009). A motivated employee is responsive\nof the definite goals and objectives he/she must achieve, therefore he/she directs its efforts in that", "word_count": 249, "start_char": 22190, "end_char": 23811}

Rutherford (1990) reported that motivation formulates an organization more successful\nbecause provoked employees are constantly looking for improved practices to do work, so it is\nessential for organizations to persuade motivation of their employees (Kalimullah et al, 2010).\nAccording to Derek, Laura Hall & Taylor (2002) no concept of human resource receives as much\nattention from academicians, researchers and practicing managers as motivation. The increased\nattention towards motivation is justified by several reasons. Motivated employees are always\nlooking for better ways to do a job. This statement can apply to corporate strategists and to\nproduction workers when people actively seek new ways of doing things, they usually find them.\nIt is the responsibility of managers to make employees look for better ways of doing their jobs.\nUnderstanding of the nature of motivation is helpful in this context.\nA motivated employee generally is more quality oriented. This is true whether we are talking\nabout a top manager spending extra time in data gathering and analysis. In either case, the\norganization benefits because individuals in and outside the organization see the enterprise as\nquality conscious. A clear understanding of the way motivation works helps a manager make his\nemployees quality oriented. Highly motivated workers are more productive than a pathetic\nworker. The productivity of the workers becomes a question of the managements’ ability to\nmotivate its employees. An appreciation of the nature of motivation is highly useful for\nmanagers (Derek et al., 2002).\nEvery organization requires human resources in addition to financial and physical resources for it\nto function. Three behavioral dimensions of human resource are significant to the organization.\n(i) People must be attracted not only to join the organization but also to remain in it. (ii) People\nmust perform the tasks for which they are hired and must do so in a dependable manner. (iii)\nPeople must go beyond this dependable role performance and engage in some form of creative,\nspontaneous and innovative behavior at work. For an organization to be effective, it must come\nto grips with the motivational problems of stimulating both the decisions to participate and the\ndecision to produce at work (Derek et al., 2002).\nMotivation as a concept represents a highly complex phenomenon that affects and is affected by\na multitude of factors in the organizational milieu.

As technology increases in complexity,\nmachines tend to become necessary yet insufficient vehicles of effective and efficient operations.\nModern technology can no longer be considered synonymous with the term automation.\nConsider the example of the highly technology based space programme in our country.\nResearcher’s view: In the researcher’s view therefore, staff motivation can be seen as the act of\nan organization that involves enabling a good working environment with improved benefits to\nemployees intended to increase their productivity at work place\n2.1.2 Organizational productivity\nGlen (2014) stated that the manufacturing sector is an ever changing beast and every year, the\nindustry is faced with fresh challenges. The author stated that virtually all media houses\nconstantly report the closure of industrial units, labour disputes between employers and their\nemployees or reductions in the labour force due to recession and other economic dynamics. As a\nresult, the image of manufacturing industries have been marred by low wages, high labour\nturnover, inadequate working conditions, poor performance and productivity (Githinji, 2014).\nProductivity can be referred to as the quantity of work that is attained in a unit of time by means\nof the factors of production. These factors include technology, capital, entrepreneurship, land and\nlabour. It is the link between inputs and outputs and increases when an increase in output occurs\nwith a lesser than comparative increase in input. It also occurs when equal amount of output is\ngenerated using fewer inputs (ILO, 2005).\nBhatti (2007) and Qureshi (2007) were of the perspective that productivity can be seen as a\nmeasure of performance that encompasses both efficiency and effectiveness. It can also be\nreferred to as the ratio of output or production capacity of the workers in an organization. It is the\ncorrelation that exists between the quantity of inputs and outputs from a clearly defined process.\nThe performance of a business which determines its continued existence and development is\nlargely dependent on the degree of productivity of its workers.

More precisely, productivity is a measure that\nindicates how well essential resources are used to accomplish specified objectives in terms of\nquantity and quality within a given time frame. It is suitable when measuring the actual output\nproduced compared to the input of resources, taking time into consideration. Hence, productivity\nratios indicate the extent at which organizational resources are effectively and efficiently used to\nproduce desired outputs. Efficiency takes into account the time and resources required to execute\na given task. Therefore, it can be concluded that effectiveness and efficiency are significant\npredictors of productivity.\n2.2 Forms of staff motivation used to achieve productivity\nThere are two types of motivation, intrinsic and extrinsic motivation thus it is important to\nunderstand we are not all the same; thus effectively motivating your employees requires that you\ngain an understanding of the different forms of motivation, such an understanding will enable the\norganization to better categorize the team members and apply the appropriate form of motivation\naccordingly.\nThe first one is called intrinsic motivation and it refers to the motivation that comes from inside\nthe individual. It is an internal desire that stems from feelings such as pride for contributing to\nsomething worthwhile, being excited by work related challenges and satisfaction in the personal\ndevelopment or growth that may come from tasks or certain work activities that we perform.\nExtrinsic motivation on the other hand occurs when external factors such as praise, salary and\nstatus, influence our levels of motivation. There are obviously a lot more definitions of\nmotivation but it is clear that they all agree that motivation is a psychological process that\ninfluences those internal motives responsible for directing our behavior aimed at reaching\nspecific goals and objectives through meaningful result orientated actions.\n2.2.1 Intrinsic motivation", "word_count": 391, "start_char": 28573, "end_char": 31150}

In\ncontrast to extrinsic motivation, intrinsic motivation is said to exist when behavior is performed\nfor its own sake rather than to obtain material or social rein forcers.\nIntrinsic rewards like recognition creates role models and communicates the standard. A study of\nwhat motivates senior managers by Analoui (2000) reveals discontent with the managerial style\nand traditional attitudes of top management who take things for granted. Good work and high\nquality performance are not often recognized. The old style and culture of passive interaction\nstill persists especially in ministries and other government organizations where some top\nmanagement is referred to as-old guards who have not really changed. Lack of recognition is not\nalways a direct consequence of the presence of old values and traditional managerial styles.\nTorrington et al (2002) on the other hand indicates that poor human resource management\nseriously de-motivates employees.\nManagement styles tend to be authoritarian with limited participation, delegation, and\ncommunication with respect to major school management functions. Employees subjected to\nthese types of management regimes feel like we are treated as children.\nMeir (1972) notes that while workers are interested in advancing their financial position, there\nare many other considerations such as opinions of their fellow workers, their comfort and\nenjoyment on the job and their long range security that prevents them from making a direct\nautomatic positive response to an incentive plan, this implies that for employees to perform and\nhave better results they must be motivated by a token of appreciation.\n\nStone (1988) also found that the effectiveness and intrinsic reward relationship follows the social\nchallenge theory; employees ‘performance is giving back to organizations from which they get\ntheir satisfaction.\nThe observation by (Ryan& Stiller, 1991) says that intrinsic motivation has emerged as\nimportant phenomena for educators_ a natural wellspring of learning and achievement that can\nbe systematically catalyzed or undermined by parent and teacher practices.", "word_count": 445, "start_char": 30817, "end_char": 33836}

Extrinsic motivators can have an\nimmediate and powerful effect but will not necessary last long (Mullins, 2005; Armsrong, 2003).\nBernard & stoner (2005) proposes the following are incentives for employees: Salary, Wages and\nconditions of service as explained the same way by Sansone & Harackiewicz (2000), extrinsic\nmotivation results from the attainment of externally administered rewards, including pay,\nmaterial possessions, prestige, and positive evaluations from others. In this study, extrinsic\nmotivation of employees included externally administered rewards like salary, free\naccommodation, free meals, weekly duty and allowances, advance payments in case of financial\nproblems, leave of absence and free medical care among others.\nWayne (1998) asserts that a reward in form of pay has a strong impact on the employees\n‘performance. Bratton (2003), agree with Wayne when they state that pay is one of the most\npowerful motivating tools. Similarly, Armstrong (1996) emphasizes the value of extrinsic\nmotivation when he says that money provides the means to achieve a number of different ends.\nAbove all he asserts that money in form of pay is the most obvious extrinsic reward.\nKiseesi (1998), in her study about job satisfaction of workers recommends that salaries of\nworkers should be paid promptly and that promotion of workers should be accompanied by a\ncorresponding increase in the salary they earn. She observes that salary is a strong force that\nkeeps workers at their jobs.", "word_count": 292, "start_char": 33583, "end_char": 35514}

Therefore, all employees need\nthe desire to be satisfied at work and once all are motivated, their performance will definitely\nincrease.\nGrusky (in print) explains more about rewards as the most important factors which influence the\nstrength of a person’s attachment to an organization. He says that if a person discovers that he\ncannot obtain the rewards he originally desired, he either leaves the organization or joins another,\nor if it is not feasible, he accepts those rewards which he can obtain and at the same time feels\nless committed to that organization. On the other hand, obtaining rewards sought operates to\nfurther his felt obligation to the organization and this commitment is strengthened.\nSimilarly, Armstrong (1996) emphasizes the value of financial rewards when he says that money\nprovides the means to achieve a number of different ends. Kiseesi (1998) in her study about job\nsatisfaction of workers recommends that, salaries of the workers should be paid promptly and\nthat promotion of workers should have a corresponding increase on the salary they earn.\nTherefore, from the above expression, financial rewards have greater effects than non-financial\nrewards on motivation of employees.\n2.3 Staff motivation challenges\nPork working environment: Employee level of motivation is also hindered by the quality of the\nworking environment both its physical attributes and the degree to which it provides meaningful\nwork. While a comfortable physical environment is correlated with employee motivation, the\nrelationship is not merely as strong as the relationship between motivation and managerial\nbehavior (Yazdani et al 2011). Work environment plays an essential role since it influences\nemployee motivation. Employees are concerned with a comfortable physical work environment", "word_count": 419, "start_char": 35210, "end_char": 37921}

Lack of favorable working\nconditions, amongst other things, can affect badly on the employee's mental and physical wellbeing. According to Arnold and Feldman (1996) factors such as working hours, temperature,\nventilation, noise, hygiene, lighting, and resources are all part of working conditions.\nLack of other benefits: Robert (2006) commented that, companies that keep morale high with\nperiodic incentives, enhance their production. Robert (2006) added that, human beings thrive on\nappreciation and receiving incentives sends the message that they are valued and appreciated.\nWhether the incentive is something concrete, such as bonuses, a free lunch or any other tangible\nevidence of appreciation, motivation will increase to an all-time high. Intangible tokens, such as\nan employee of the month award will serve the same motivating purpose (Robert,\n2006).Research has suggested that rewards lead to satisfaction of the employee which directly\ninfluences performance of the employee (Kalimullah et al, 2010). All businesses use pay,\npromotion, bonuses or other types of rewards to motivate and encourage high level performances\nof employees (Reena et al, 2009). To use salaries as a motivator effectively, managers must\nconsider salary structures which should include importance organization attach to each job,\npayment according to performance, personal or special allowances, fringe benefits, pensions and\nso on (Armstrong, 2007).\nWeak leadership: Leadership is about getting things done the right way, to do that you need\npeople to follow you, you need to have them trust you. And if you want them to trust you and do\nthings for you and the organization, they need to be motivated (Baldoni, 2005). Theories imply\nthat leader and followers raise one another to higher levels of morality and motivation\n(Rukhmani.K, 2010).Motivation is purely and simply a leadership behavior. It stems from\nwanting to do what is right for people as well as for the organization. Leadership and motivation\nare active processes (Baldoni.J, 2005).\nFailure to empower employees: Lack of empowerment hinders motivation of employees in\norganizations and reduces sense of belonging and pride in the workforce.

Employees\nexecute their finest novelties and thoughts with the sense of belonging, enthusiasm, and delight,\nin empowered organizations. Adding up, they work with a sense of responsibility and prefer\nbenefits of the organization to theirs (Yazdani,B.O. et al, 2011).\nAt the same time, there is some evidence that job enrichment may sometimes cause employees to\nbe dissatisfied. The reason may be that employees who are given additional autonomy and\nresponsibility may expect greater levels of pay or other types of compensation, and if this\nexpectation is not met, they may feel frustrated. One more thing to remember is that job\nenrichment may not be suitable for all employees. Not all employees desire to have control over\nhow they work, and if they do not have this desire, they may feel dissatisfied in an enriched job\n(Whittaker, 2008).\nLack of trust: Trust is defined as the perception of one about others, decision to act based on\nspeech, behavior and their decision (Hassan et al, 2010). If an organization wants to improve and\nbe successful, trust plays a significant role so it should always be preserved to ensure an\norganizations existence and to enhance employees’ motivation (Annamalai.T, 2010). It can make\nintrapersonal and interpersonal effects and influence on the relations inside and out the\norganization (Hassan et al, 2010).\nPoor communication within the organization: Managers can stimulate motivation by giving\nrelevant information and making it readily available to the employees. To this researcher it\nseems that there is no known organization in which people do not usually feel there should be\nimprovement in the way departments communicate, cooperate, and collaborate with one another.\nInformation availability brings to bear a powerful peer pressure, where two or more people\nrunning together will run faster than when running alone or running without awareness of the\npace of the other runners. By sharing information, subordinates compete with one another hence\nlifting up each other’s self-confidence (Chiang and Jang, 2008).\nLack of promotional opportunities; Promotional opportunities affect employee motivation\nconsiderably.

It is no surprise that\nthe employees take promotion as the ultimate achievement in their career and when it is realized,\nhe/she feels extremely satisfied (Turkyilmaz et al, 2011).\nResearcher’s view: In conclusion, it can be noted that there are several factors like lack of trust,\npoor working conditions and poor communication that can critically reduce the productivity of\nemployees in the organization. As noted by several scholars, it is essential for managers to\ncontinuous find out such motivation challenges and make all possible ways to remove them so as\nto effectively increase organizational productivity.\n\n2.4 Solutions to staff motivation challenges\nMotivation of the workers depends on a number of factors. Determinants of worker motivation\noriginate at the individual level, the immediate organizational level and the environmental level\n(Bennett and Franco, 2009). Thus motivational strategies can be looked at from any of these\nlevels after careful assessment of where the greatest impact can be attained. According to Zurn\n(2003), there are several incentives or motivational factors under each level. There is a small but\ngrowing body of qualitative studies looking at motivation of workers in developing countries that\nindicate the limitations of financial incentives on motivation and that reveal the importance of\nnon-financial incentives (Mutizwa Mangiza, 2018).\nAccording to Milton (2011), stimulation is understood as an external interference of human\nbehavior, systematically influencing and regulating human motivation. We stimulate people,\nbecause we want them to do what we desire. There are various ways to stimulate workers to\nmake them work more efficiently. The following chapter gives information about different types\nof incentives that can be used by a company to motivate its employees.\nIncentives: Organizations have various possibilities how they can evoke motivation in the\nemployees. It should be pointed out that incentives are effective only when they are in\naccordance with the employees’ needs. If a person‘s thirsty the main item they desire is\nsomething to drink. This is the same with incentives. When a person’s main wish is to be\nrecognized by others, money is not as a powerful incentive as a public praise and promotion.", "word_count": 414, "start_char": 42619, "end_char": 45334}

It is generally known that the more advanced the organization, the greater the versatility\nof incentives used (Kokn, 2013). An organization can choose between tangible and intangible\nnon- financial reward and intangible reward.\nTangible reward: Tangible reward, in other words, monetary reward can be financial and nonfinancial. Financial reward is given to employees for time spent on the job, according to the\nposition held, the amount of responsibility, performance and other criteria. Stephen P. Robins\nand David A. Decenze, (2007) argue that financial incentives are the most motivating if they are\nrelated to the performance and they are not the only theorists who claim this.\nAn employee should be able to see a clear linkage between the effort they put into the task and\nthe reward received the incentives are often labeled as PRP (Performance Related Pay).\nAccording to Stephen and Decenzo (2007), non-financial rewards are designed to enrich\nemployee’s lives. Among them we can name allowances, commissions, incentives and bonuses.\nEven though money is a very useful incentive tool in improving employee motivation, it does not\nwork for everyone. Gizela Hagemannova (2015) and many other theorists claim tangible\nincentive work until an employee experience lack of money for their standard of living.\nTherefore we can assume that money would be a very good motivator for ordinary workers, but\nwould not be as powerful motivator for managers, who generally earn enough money to cover\ntheir needs and therefore search for other specific features organization can offer them. For this\npurpose organizations has to look for different incentives, which will give managers the feeling\nthat they that they are valued by the organization. This are referred to as intangible rewards.\nIntangible reward: Most employees’ honor when their work effort is recognized by their\nemployers, therefore organizations should devote more time to express appreciation to their staff.\nHowever, money is not the only way to do this. There are incentives that lack a material factor,\nbut still have a great power to motivate. A public praise, a promotion and a positive evaluation\nare just some examples of intangible rewards. It is widely discussed which type of incentive is\nthe most powerful. However, every employee has different values and therefore what stimulates\none employee may not be what stimulates the other. Although there are countless ways of to\nstimulate employees’ motivation, it is the task of the human resource manager to find out the", "word_count": 461, "start_char": 45101, "end_char": 47977}

The previously mentioned facts showed a close connection between an\nindividual’s inner motivation and stimulation that mainly comes from outside (Arnold and\nFeldman, 2016).\nProper leadership: Employees can also be motivated through proper leadership, as leadership is\nall about getting thing done the right way. In order to achieve these goals, the leader should gain\nthe employees’ trust and make them follow him. Nevertheless, in order to make them trust him\nand complete their tasks properly for the organization, the employees should be motivated\n(Baldoni, 2005). The leaders and the employees help one another to attain high levels of morality\nand motivation.\nPutting in place training programmes; Irrespective of the degree of technical automation,\nattaining high levels of productivity is influenced by the level of motivation and effectiveness of\nthe staff. Therefore, developing and implementing employee training programs is a necessary\nstrategy to motivate workers. In addition, a good communication between the managers and the\nworkforce can instigate motivation, as the degree of ambiguity decreases.\nEmployee empowerment: Empowerment is defined according to Bennis (2009) as an approach to\nleadership that empowers subordinates as a main constituent of managerial and organizational\neffectiveness. Moreover, employees are given authority and the freedom to make decisions,\nwhich encourages them to discover and use their full potential. Having more control over their\nown jobs is the main driving force of empowerment that encourages growth and better\nproductivity. Therefore, the empowerment process focuses on solving the problems of the\norganizations by people. Furthermore, empowering makes workforce feel appreciated and that\ntheir feedback on performance is valuable for the organization. The contribution of the\nemployees and their participation in designing the organization are essential for the well-being of\nthe organization, as individuals should do efforts in the environment where they are responsible\nfor their actions (Kreitner, 2015).\nPlanning and career development: One of the best ways to ensure employee motivation and longterm commitment and loyalty of employees to the organization is to transform a job of some into\na career for that employee (Harrington, 2011). Indeed the best way to keep employees is to make\nthem understand that they have a future in the organization and thus will devote personal time to", "word_count": 422, "start_char": 47648, "end_char": 50446}

Although in literature career\nplanning is considered a key element in the human resources motivational strategy and an\nessential component of career management, practice shows that managers do not give due\nimportance considering it's a pointless waste of time and resources (Marinas, 2010).\nCoaching and mentoring: Coaching is \"an interactive process through which managers and\nsupervisors seek to resolve motivation issues or to develop staff capacity through collaboration\nand based on three components: technical support, personal support and individual challenge”\n(Luecke, 2004). The aim of the coaching is to improve professional performance, correct\ninappropriate behaviors and unlock a person's potential to maximize their own performance.\nResearcher’s view: In conclusion, it can be noted that there are several motivational strategies\nthat an organization can put in place in order to improve employees’ performance for example\nincrease in salaries, continuous training and promotions among others. However, organizations\nneed to emphasize on the critically studying its employees first by carrying out assessments and\ninquiries as this will give them a platform on determining the motivational strategies that need to\nbe adopted and offered to these employees.\n2.5 Staff motivation and organizational productivity\nVarious studies have examined the effect of extrinsic and intrinsic motivation on a workers’\nperformance and productivity levels. Also most of these studies have obtained different results\nfrom their analysis (Jibowo, 2007). For instance, Rewards that an individual receives be it\nintrinsic or extrinsic are very essential in understanding the concept of motivation. Previous\nstudies have proposed that rewards leads to fulfillment and can affect a worker' to be affected,\nwhich directly influences the performance as well as productivity levels of the employee. Lawler\n(2018) stated that certain elements affect worker’s productivity levels in relation to their jobs.\nFirst, productivity is dependent on the amount of monetary or non-monetary benefits they\nactually receive as opposed to the amount they feel they deserve.\nGenerally studies conducted on the impact of motivation as it relates to workplace productivity\nhas drawn significant attention in the aspect of management; however it has been basically\ndisregarded by most establishments.

These\nincentives could be in form of good working conditions, work environment and compensation\namongst others. Incentives are regarded as variable payments (monetary and non- monetary)\nmade to workers or a team of workers based on the quantity of output or results attained. On the\nother hand, it can be seen as payments made with the purpose of stimulating workers’\nperformance and productivity levels towards achieving greater objectives (Banjoko, 2006).\nIncentives can also be described as any compensation with the exception of basic wages or\nsalaries that vary based on the capacity of the workforce to attain certain standards, such as predetermined procedures and stated organizational goals and objectives (Martocchio, 2006).\nTherefore one can conclude that there is a link between motivation and productivity this is due to\nthe fact that a lack of motivation leads to a decrease in productivity and vice versa.\nThe research carried out by Lin (2007) on the assessment of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation on\nemployee productivity, The results gotten from the examination revealed that there was a\nsignificant correlation between extrinsic motivation and the productivity level of the workers,\nwhile that of intrinsic motivation was statistically less significant than extrinsic even though a\ncorrelation also existed between intrinsic factors and workers’ productivity levels. As a result,\nimplications of the findings for future study were stated.\nJibowo (2007) in the study; motivation and workplace productivity amongst workers basically\nassumed the similar methods as (Herzberg, 2000). The study shows some supports for the impact\nof motivation on productivity. However more value was placed on extrinsic factors than\nintrinsic.

This source was used to gather new information from the\nparticipants as regards the topic and area under study.\n3.6.2 Secondary source\nSecondary data is collecting and possibly processing data by people other than the researcher in\nquestion. For the purposes of a historical research project, secondary sources are generally\nscholarly books and articles. Also included were reference sources like encyclopedias. This\nsource was used to collect data from the already written literature for example text books,\njournals, newspapers and periodicals.\n3.7 Data collection instruments\nThe researcher collected data from respondents by use of a questionnaire guide which was used\nas a tool or instrument of data of data collection.\n3.7.1 Questionnaire guide\nAhuja (2009) define a questionnaire as a structured set of questions usually sent by mail, though\nsometimes it is delivered by hand. The researcher used both open-ended and closed-ended\nquestions which according to Ahuja (2009) refer to fixed choice questions which require the\nrespondent to choose a response from those provided by the researcher.

The researcher exhibited a high level of ethical behaviour in the\ncourse of implementing the study; confidentiality where the information got from the field was\nonly used for academic purposes. There was also anonymity of the respondents exhibited so that\nthey got the freedom to express themselves. More so, informed consent was obtained from all\nrespondents before including them in the study.\n3.11 Limitations and the solutions\nThe cost of carrying out the study was high considering that the researcher had limited resource\nlike transport and stationary that was used in typesetting, printing and photocopying the proposal\nand dissertation. This challenge was however solved by appealing to relatives, friends and wellwishers for support of the study with a hope of being beneficial to them.\n\nTime to conduct research study in depth was not enough however; this was solved by\nformulating appointments with the supervisor in addition to the researcher being committed.\nThe research also encountered lack of enough data and information from the respondent for the\nstudy as some respondents were reluctant and fearing to give out information about the study\ncase.
