The study was based on three main objectives\nwhich were: To find out the impact of local service tax on service delivery, to find out if\ntaxpayers are aware of all tax obligations and policies, to determine the level of service\ndelivery to the people and to find out problems faced by taxpayers and their businesses.\nThe researcher used both qualitative and quantitative research designs with a sample of 80\nrespondents. Qualitative data was obtained through questionnaires, interviews, and\nobservation while quantitative data was obtained through computation and analysis. The\ncollected data was analyzed using Microsoft Excel and presented in the form of tables.\nThe study findings revealed that there is a significant relationship between Local Service Tax\nand Service Delivery in Buguju indicated by a correlation of r = 0.677. The research findings\nshowed that 90% of respondents agreed that they had a problem with the mode of assistance\n80% with the mode of tax collection and 51.6% of the respondents revealed that there is too\nmuch inefficiency among tax collectors.\nThe study recommends measures for LST collection like training tax collectors, sensitizing\nthe masses, etc. The study suggests that future studies should be conducted to analyze any\nother factors that affect revenue collection as well as services delivered by the local\ngovernment.\nThe study concludes that town agents have challenges in revenue collection but such\nproblems were not beyond control and also service is delivered according to the amount of\nrevenue collected since it’s a source of government funding for community services.\n\nCHAPTER ONE.\nINTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND\n1.0 Introduction\nLocal Services Tax.

It\ninvolves the administration, collection, and enforcement of taxes, as well as providing\nassistance and guidance to taxpayers. Examples of services delivered are; maintenance of\nroads, garbage collection, and Education services among others.\nMukono Central Division is an administrative division located in Mukono Municipality,\nwhich is situated in the Central Region of Uganda.

It is also home to several higher education\ninstitutions, including Uganda Christian University, which is one of the prominent\nuniversities in the country.\n1.2 Statement of the problem.\nLocal Service Taxes are raised by the government to generate revenue used to deliver\nservices to the public in various fields like health, education, and infrastructure as this will\nhelp to improve on the performance of different businesses.\nDespite the payments of the local service tax by the locals of Bugujju, the service delivery by\nthe local government is still poor. There are no garbage containers at the different points\nwhich has resulted in poor waste disposal exposing the local people to the risk of contracting\ndiseases like cholera. There are poor roads with a lot of dust which has a negative impact on\nbusinesses dealing in food commodities like restaurants which limit the number of customers.\nSome roads are inaccessible due to deep potholes which hinders motor vehicles from\ndelivering services to some parts of the community within Bugujju.\n1.3 Objectives of the study.\n1.3.1 General Objective.\nThe general purpose of the study was to evaluate the impact of Local Service Tax on Service\nDelivery to the people of Bugujju, Mukono Central Division.\n1.3.2 Objectives of the study.\nI.\nTo find out the impact of local service tax on service delivery in Bugujju, Mukono\nCentral Division.\nII.\nTo find out if taxpayers are aware of all tax obligations and policies in Bugujju,\nMukono Central Division.\nIII.\nTo determine the level of service delivery to the people of Bugujju, Mukono Central\nDivision.", "word_count": 378, "start_char": 15449, "end_char": 17867}

However, it particularly addresses the problems affecting taxpayers, the awareness of the\ntax obligation and service delivery to the locals, and the theoretical review.\n2.1 The Concept of Local Service Tax.\nThis refers to the assessment, collection, administration, and management of local revenue in\nUganda. It deals with raising public revenue and managing public expenditure and debt. It is\nthe responsibility of the local government who represent the Uganda Revenue Authority\n(URA) at the municipal level (Manasseh,2010). The general idea behind the taxation is the\nprovision of public goods and services.\nTaxation (Local Service Tax) is a payment that cannot be avoided without attracting a\npunishment and in return of which no gain/ quid pro-quo is promised by the government to\nthe taxpayer (Balunywa,2018). The government is responsible for providing its citizens with\ncertain public facilities and services like roads, hospitals, schools, and market securities.\nThere are two main tax authorities; the Local Government Authority and the Central\nGovernment Authority (URA).\n2.2 The purpose of taxation (Local Service Tax).\nAccording to the Income Tax Act (2017), Local Service Tax is an important source of\ngovernment revenue and an economic policy tool for the government to attain economic\ngrowth. The importance of taxation therefore raises a debate about whether the government\nshould interfere in the operations of market mechanism. Income Tax Act (2014) further noted\nthat taxes may be levied for other reasons but revenue remains the prime objective of most\ntaxes.", "word_count": 342, "start_char": 19421, "end_char": 21756}

The Economic Journal (2013) also shows that, in stressing\nthe consumption-reducing aspect, taxes may change the distribution of income and help to\nstabilize the economy.\n2.2.1 Taxpayer’s knowledge.\nMost Ugandans have a poor understanding of the rationale of taxes and knowledge of the\ndifferent taxes imposed on them (Copying with Taxes 2016). As a result, the tax compliance\nin Uganda is still very low. Besides that, various surveys conducted on local businesses\nsuggest that about 60% of them keep no records at all, while 25% keep partial records\nmaking it difficult to assess taxes (Ndandiko, 2010).\nTherefore, there is a need to sensitize the public, especially business owners. The\nsensitization should be done on not only local service tax but different taxes like trading\nlicenses etc. that impact business owners and the rationale that underlines the imposition of\ntaxes because taxpayers are not aware of the reasons for paying taxes, evasion of tax duties,\nlaws and regulations are very rampant. (World Bank Survey, 2014)\n2.3 Tax policy.\nThe World Bank has influenced many countries in undertaking tax reform policies. In the\ncase of Uganda, the tax base has remained significantly narrow since independence, leading\nto inadequate tax revenue. By 2004, the tax ratio of tax revenue to GDP was just 18-20%. The\ncomposition of tax revenue has been predominantly important. Small business is taxed\ndifferently compared to corporate businesses with an annual turnover of above 50 million\nshillings. As quoted by Kitinisa (2003),\n2.4 Approaches to Tax Administration.\nAccording to Bird (2014), tax administration refers to the identification of a taxpayer,\ncollection, and enforcement of tax liability. According to Olman (2017), tax administration\nrefers to a structure of identification of potential taxpayers, collection, and laws governing\ntaxation.", "word_count": 381, "start_char": 21485, "end_char": 23946}

The\nweaknesses in tax administration are mainly a lack of relevant information about taxpayers,\nand continued criticism of tax and its structure. The tax structure should be simple in order to\navoid tax evasion.\n2.4.1 Identification of a Tax Payer.\nTaxes are levied on individuals, groups/legal entities' income earned. The identification of a\ntaxpayer is done with reference to natural/ artificial persons who can earn income.\nHowever, for the purpose of this research, we shall confine ourselves to business as a\ntaxpayer and a business can be defined as a vocation, trade, profession, or adventure in the\nnature of trade but does not include employment (Income Act, 2017).\n2.4.2 Implementation of Revenue Plan and Services Delivery.\nImplementation of a revenue plan entails indicators namely, motivating staff, capacity\nbuilding, and recruitment of skilled staff. The indicators are explained below in line with\nservice delivery by several scholars for instance Abelson(2006) stressed that the local\ngovernments are capable of providing public services, mobilizing community resources,\nstimulating private investments, expanding rural-urban linkages, adopting national\ndevelopment to local conditions and investing in local infrastructure based on collected low\nrevenue. This was found to be true of Buguju as it had failed in its attempt to successfully hit\nthe revenue threshold therefore negatively affecting the delivery of local services to its\nSimilarly, Onwe(2009) reveals that the manpower capacity of the local government\ncompetition with the staff of the local government will not yield the desired result. And that\nthere is a skilled gap among the few senior staff of the local government. The new revenue\nforecast issues have since remained complex even though the local government does not have\nthe technical capacity to mobilize for local revenue since what they actually plan does not\nconfirm the actual collected hence a revenue gap.\n2.4.3 Revenue expenditure control and service delivery.\nRevenue expenditure control entails three indicators namely budget implementation review,\nquarterly audit reports, and quarterly progress performance report. The indicators are", "word_count": 398, "start_char": 23592, "end_char": 26300}

The scholars\nargue that it is important to recognize and strengthen systems of mutual accountability and\npartnership at the local level inclusive of Local governments. The ability to ensure joint\nresponsibility for service delivery runs the risk of everyone’s responsibility becoming no\none’s responsibility. In addition, Mbufu (2011) further argues that formalizing a revenue\nenhancement plan, budget priority allocations and effectively implementing the plan are\nissues that can better service delivery. On the contrary, Nananya (2003) recommends that in\norder to enhance local government revenue, accountability of such revenue would be seen in\nterms of the quality and quantity of public services extended to the local communities. The\nscholars further note accessing such services would drive more people to pay the tax that is\nallocated to the provision of such services however Local governments would register more\ntaxes if it strengthened the enforcement of laws and adherence to revenue controls. In this\nstudy, it was found that Buguju collected more local revenue base whenever its staff observed\nthe Local government's local revenue controls.\nLuzige (2008) receipts that sources of revenue for instance parking fees, rent, licenses, and\npermits among others are instrumental in realizing service delivery in Local governments\nincluding expenditure on health, education, sports and technical services, roads, and\ncommunity and welfare. To the scholar, any increase in local revenue collection improved\nservice delivery thus a significant relationship between local revenue performance and\nservices delivery.\nPradeep (2011) classified reports in Local Government (LG) as being financial reports,\ncouncil reports, and performance reports among others. He further explains that financial\nreports are formal records of a business or organization's financial activities while Mbufu\n(2013), argues that records are used by the management for decision-making as they are used\nfor future references to know which period had a decline in revenue collection and which one\nhad the highest collections. The scholar adds that records and reports are used for audit\npurposes and as supporting documents in case a local government is to request funds from the\ncentral government and donors (Okotie,2010).\n\nOther factors that affect local services tax and business are;", "word_count": 393, "start_char": 26124, "end_char": 28840}

Technology affects both taxation and\nservice delivery. Proper adoption of technology eases tax collection and administration thus\nimproving the process of taxation. On the other hand, most of the owners of businesses rarely\nadhere to technological advancement as this gives the tax bodies the authority to take the\nloopholes in the knowledge of business owners to exploit them thereby reducing the\nperformance of their businesses.\nAttitude of the taxpayers; A negative attitude toward taxation greatly leads to tax evasion\nwhere taxpayers deliberately refuse to pay the taxes. This forces the tax bodies to look for\nthose who dodge paying taxes and end up closing their business premises thus reducing their\ntime of operation thence leading to poor or no delivery of services especially in the months\nwhen business premises are closed (Kanisa, 2014).\n2.4.4 Taxes and Profit Levels.\nThe taxable profits of the business are always different from the normal business account\nprofits for three major reasons;\ni. Certain income which may be considered in the normal accounting system may not be\nliable to tax.\nii. Certain expenses that are deducted on profit and loss account may not be available when\ndetermining taxable income,\niii.

Revenue enhancement planning is categorized as the identification of\nrevenue resources, assessment, and enforcement where local revenue if well collected can be\nrealized through timely enforcement while implementation of a revenue plan entails\nmotivating staff, capacity building, and recruitment of skilled staff. Further to note, revenue\nexpenditure control entails implementation reviews, quarterly audit reports, and quarterly\nprogress performance reports. Local governments are capable of providing public services,\nmobilizing community resources, stimulating private investments, expanding rural-urban\nlinkages, adopting national development to local conditions, and investing in local\ninfrastructure based on the collected low revenue. Local revenue can be improved and\nstrengthened through accountability to enable taxpayers to appropriately relate tax paid to\nservice delivery coupled with the strengthening enforcement of laws governing the\nadministration and collection of taxes. Gaps identified include declining local revenue\nsources, political interference, and unfair procedures for revenue collection, and planning\nwhich cause mistrust causing tax invasion.", "word_count": 229, "start_char": 30439, "end_char": 32152}

It discusses the research\ndesign, study population, sampling, and study variables, sources of data, data collection\nmethods and instruments, data processing, analysis and presentation, and limitations of the\nstudy.\n3.1 Research design.\nCross-sectional survey design based on the use of qualitative and quantitative approaches\nthat were adopted to establish the relationship between Local Services Tax and Services\ndelivery. This design was used for profiling, defining, segmentation, estimating, predicting,\nand examining associative relationships. Cross-sectional studies easily provide a quick\nsnapshot of what’s going on with the variables for the research problem.\n3.2 Study population.\nThe study comprised of 100 Managers/owners and employees of businesses in Buguju,\nMukono Central Division.\n3.3 Sampling.\n3.3.1 Sampling design.\nThe sampling design was used to select representative elements or respondents from the\ntarget or accessible population. In this research, I used both purposive and simple random\nsampling methods; this involved selecting respondents randomly and random interviews of\nthe chosen officials. This technique or design helped me get unbiased data since purposive\nsampling could enable me to deal with respondents who have adequate information about the\nimpact of Local Service Tax on service delivery.\n3.3.2 Sample size\nThe study involved 80 respondents.

The chapter was divided into\nsub-chapters namely: demographic characteristics of respondents and findings in relationship\nto the objectives of the study.\n4.1 Demographic characteristics of respondents.\nThe respondents’ demographic characteristics include; age, gender, level of education, and\nlevel of experience.\n4.2.1 Age of the respondents\nThe respondents were required to indicate their ages and the distribution of the\nrespondents by age is shown in Figure 4.1.\nFigure 4.1: Age of the respondents\nAge of respondents\n\nNumbers\n\nPercentage\n20-25\n\n9%\n26-30\n\n14%\n31-35\n\n51%\n36-40\n\n20%\n41- above\n\n6%\nTotal\nSource Primary data\nFrom Figure 4.2, the study revealed that the largest number of respondents were in the age\ngroup of 31-35years (4l)5l%, these were followed by those in the range of 36-40\n\n40 years (16)20% and the smallest number was those who were in the range of 41 and above\nyears and above who were (5)6.7% respondents. This implies that most of the respondents\nwere in the age range of 31-35 years.\n4.1.2 Gender of the Respondent.\nThe study captured the gender of the respondents in order to establish the most dominant\nbusiness people in Buguju. The respondents were asked to state their sex and the distributions\nare shown in table 4.1.\nTable 4.1: Gender of the respondents\nGender\nMale\n62.5\nFemale\n37.5\nTotal\nAccording to the results for the gender of the respondents in Table 4.1, of the 80 respondents,\nthe majority were males (50) contributing 62.5% of the total sample of the entire sample.\nThis therefore implies that the most dominant business people are males.\n4.23 Level of Education of the Respondents\nI asked the respondents to state their level of education to find out whether the respondents\ncould be able to interpret the questionnaires given to them. The findings indicated that all the\nrespondents in the targeted group had relevant knowledge to read, interpret, and answer the\nquestionnaires given to them by the researcher as presented in Table 4.\nFigure 4.2.2: Table of level of education\nLevel of education\nPercentage\nPrimary level\n7.50%\nCertificate\n26.25%\nDiploma\n16.25%\nDegree\n25.0%\nSecondary\n2.5%\nTotal", "word_count": 435, "start_char": 37499, "end_char": 40251}

This means that the majority of respondents\nwere literate and able to understand and internalize the contents of the questionnaires.\n\n4.1.4 Time spent in the business\nThe respondents were asked to state the period they had spent in their businesses and the\nfindings showed that most of the respondents had spent reasonable time in doing business as\ncaptured in table 4.2.\nTable 4.2 Time spent on running the business by the respondents\nTime spent(year)\n6.7\n2-3\n15.6\n3-4\n56.6\n4 and above\n22.2\nTotal\n\nSource: Primary Data\nThe findings in Table 4.2 indicated that out of the 80 respondents, the majority had spent 3-4\nyears in business (44)56.6%, followed by those who had spent 4 years and above on their\ncurrent job (l8)22.2%, then those who had spent 2-3 years were (12)l5.6% and the least\nnumber of respondents who had spent less than 2 years on their job and these were (6)6.7%.\nThis implies that most of the respondents had experience concerning the effect of local\nservices tax on the delivery of services within Buguju.\n4.2 Awareness of the Taxpayers.\nRespondents were asked if they were aware of the taxes they pay if a business has ever been\nassessed for tax purposes, if any records were kept by the firm, how records are kept if the tax\nauthority has given any assistance as regards tax awareness, and what kind of assistance.\nAccording to the information I got, 80.0% agreed that they were aware of the taxes they\nought to pay while 20.0% indicated that they were not aware of all the taxes that they were", "word_count": 354, "start_char": 39892, "end_char": 41995}

Some business proprietors said they also lose capital as a result of heavy fines\nimposed on them when they default on their tax obligations.\nInconveniencing business operations; This happens when the staff of the tax authority visits\nbusiness premises in the routine check-ups on business. Sometimes they ask for books of\naccounts and try to interview the business owners and in the process, they inconvenience\nbusiness operations.\nFrom the above-mentioned effects, it was noted that 40% of businesses in Buguju lose\ncapital as a result of heavy fines imposed on them when they default on their tax obligation,\n4.3.4 Suggestions from Taxpayers.\nRespondents were asked to give suggestions on how their problems can be dealt with. The\nfollowing were the responses.\nTax authorities should improve or increase the period of deadlines that they give out to\ntaxpayers when giving warnings.\nMore efforts should be put into tax education so as to increase awareness and understanding\nof the mode of assessment.\n4.3.5 The services that have been delivered to the people of Buguju.\nThe study findings indicate that 96% of the respondents agreed that their Services have been\ndelivered to the Buguju community while 4% said that there are no services delivered.\n\nTable 4.10 Respondents view on the Service delivery\nService delivered\nGarbage collection\nTown planning\nRoad\nconstruction\nand\nmaintenance\nHealth Centres and medical\nfacilities\nFree\neducation\nand\nconstruction of schools\n\nSecurity, law enforcement\nTotal\n\nPrimary source data", "word_count": 421, "start_char": 46307, "end_char": 49015}

Most business entrepreneurs\nin Buguju were therefore aware of the taxes that they were supposed to pay. The findings also\nrevealed that 3l.7% of the business entrepreneurs strongly agreed that their businesses have\never been assessed for tax purposes, 23.3% agreed, 15.0% indicated that they were not\ncertain, disagreed, and strongly disagreed respectively. In all, the majority 55.0% agreed that\ntheir businesses had been assessed for purposes of paying taxes. This implies that URA\nthrough the town agent carries out assessments of the businesses before the tax they are\nmeant to pay is levied.\n\n5.1.2 Services delivered to the people of Buguju community\nAccording to the major findings, 34% of the respondents cited garbage collection as one of\nthe services delivered to the Buguju community. In their view, the respondents contended that\nthe Local revenue has helped the division to remain smart by daily collection of Garbage.\n\n5.1.3 Problems faced by taxpayers\nThe findings of the study showed that 90% of the respondents agreed that they had a problem\nwith the mode of assistance and also 80% of the respondents agreed that they had a problem\nwith the mode of tax collection and 51.6% of the respondents revealed that there is too much\ninefficiency among the tax collectors in Mukono Central division.\n\n5.2 Conclusion of the study.\n5.2.1 Awareness of the Taxpayers.\nThe findings of the study revealed that most of the owners of income-generating enterprises\nin Buguju are aware of the Local Revenue they pay and how much they pay. However, it was\nalso discovered that Business owners had not received any assistance from the tax authority\ntowards tax awareness. More so, the results showed that the nature of assistance given to\ntaxpayers is poor as it was revealed that the methods used are not fair, taxes are not fair and it\nwas also discovered that tax authorities harass taxpayers whenever they go to collect taxes.", "word_count": 434, "start_char": 48745, "end_char": 51450}

Problems faced by taxpayers.\nThe findings of the study showed that Income-generating enterprises have a problem with the\nmode of assistance and the mode of tax collection. It was also found out that there is too\nmuch inefficiency among the tax collectors in Buguju.\n\n5.3 Recommendations\n5.3.1 Awareness of the Taxpayers\nURA through the local government should find a way of assessing the Local revenue in that\nthe different categories of qualified people should pay early in the financial year in order to\ngive enough time to the businesses to pay their dues rather than make an assessment and\ndemand for payment spontaneously.\nThe tax authorities should introduce a scheme that allows taxpayers to pay the tax obligation\nin installments over a given period of time as opposed to a lump sum at once.\n\n5.3.2 Local Revenue amount paid by the people of Buguju.\nURA should revise the amount of tax paid as it was revealed that businesses are charged\nhighly.\n\n5.3.3 Problems faced by taxpayers.\nURA should reach out and educate the business community about its different tax rates and\nmodes of payment. The study revealed that the biggest problem with the Local Revenue paid\nis in fact that the community does not understand how the tax is arrived at as well as how it is\npaid but not because it is too high with the introduction of the new technology IRAS\n(Integrated Revenue Administrated System).\n\nURA should improve on the methods of collecting local revenue. It should adopt the closure\nof business premises on default only as a last resort after all the other methods of collection\nhave failed. This should be an exception and not a rule.\n\n5.3.4 Assessment of the locals of Buguju by the enforcement team.\nThe terms for locking the business should be revised especially by allowing Businesses to\npay in installments as the findings of the study revealed that locking the business as a result\nof local revenue reduces the operations and income generated.\n\n5.4 Areas for further research.\nThe researcher carried out this study in order to examine the impact of local revenue on\nservice delivery as a case study but the study was not exhaustive owing to constraints in\nterms of scope, time, and finance.
