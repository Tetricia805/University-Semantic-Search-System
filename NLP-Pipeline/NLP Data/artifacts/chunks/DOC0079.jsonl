The study was guided by three objectives namely: To\nexamine the current supply development practices adopted by Nile Breweries\nLimited (NBL), Jinja Branch, to identify key factors influencing successful supply\ndevelopment in the company and to assess the effect of supplier training on the\nperformance of Nile Breweries Limited.\nThe descriptive aspect of the research design was used to establish the role of\nsupplier development on the performance of firms, the sample size of 71\nemployees from four directorates will be selected as a sample. According to\nMugenda (2009) a sample size of 10%- 30% of a target population is adequate\nenough to make a generalization. Data was both primary and secondary. Primary\ndata was collected by the use of questionnaires and secondary data was got from\n\nreports, journals, and internet. Frequency tables, pie charts and graphs were\nworked out basing on the data. In these frequency tables, and graphs analysis was\ndone with a corresponding percentage.\nFindings revealed that carrying out supplier development is important in an\norganization for example it improves on supplier performance, it leads to reduction\nin costs, it resolves serious quality issues and developing new routes to supply\namong others. However, there are several challenges faced by organizations that\nemployee supplier development which included the need to nurture, supplier\ntraining, damaged delivery among others. There are several success factors in\nimplementation of supplier development which also included supplier's\ncommitment, trust, support from the supplier's top management, communication.\nThe research concluded that supplier development has a significant role on the\nperformance of firms which was proved by the majority of respondents who agreed\nwith the researcher.\nCHAPTER ONE\nINTRODUCTION\n1.0 Introduction\nThis particular chapter of the research contains the background, the problem,\nstatement and the aims of the research, research objectives, and research questions,\nscope of the study, geographical scope, time scope, subject scope and significance\nof the study.\n\n1.1 Background to The Study", "word_count": 382, "start_char": 10260, "end_char": 13218}

Due to its impressive partnership\nwith supplier associations, supplier networks, and suppliers themselves, Post-War\nToyota had a quick flow of knowledge sharing of network-processes, laying the\ngroundwork for Supplier Development activities (Dyer & Nobeoka, 2000). For\ninstance, businesses that adopted supplier growth techniques, such as John Deere,\nMarks & Spencer, Motorola, and Digital Equipment Corporation, attained the\nstatus of global organizations.\n\nThe 'first wave' of Supplier development research, according to Wagner (2006),\nwas initiated by quality management researchers between 1989 and 1991, and the\n\n‘second wave' began in 1995 when academics began focusing on\nrelationshiprelated concerns. Since the ‘second wave started. A select group of\nimportant authors have made a substantial contribution to the theory and practice\nof supplier development over the years. Krause, who has 11 research articles\npublished since 1997, is one of the key contributors to the field of supplier\ndevelopment. Wagner, Carr, Forker, Hahn, and Humphreys follow with each\nhaving 3 or 4 research pieces published respectively.\nIn the supplier development literature, several researchers have recognized that\nsupplier development is strategically important for the overall success of the firm\nand in turn contributes to a sustainable competitive edge and is considered one of\nthe building blocks of supplier management practices. Authors like Wagner\n(2006a), Krause et al. (1998) suggested that it is important to identify, as part of a\nsupplier strategy, which suppliers are key suppliers and how they are treated\ndifferently. For example, it might be argued that strategic supplier development is\nonly viable for key suppliers and supplier switching might be an option.", "word_count": 442, "start_char": 12889, "end_char": 15879}

Agro processing firms are constantly looking for avenues\nto reduce costs in order to become competitive and the reduction of transaction\ncosts through supplier development has been identified with great optimism. Most\nfirms fail to supply their target market because their suppliers fail to provide them\nwith inputs that they depend on in their Agro processing processes. In relation to\nunreliable supply is the problem of delayed supply (Ryu, Min and Zushi, 2008). It\nconsequently forces manufactures to hold large inventories of inputs, tying up\nfunds that could have been used for investment. (Fafchamps, Gunning and\nOostendorp, 2000)\nIn East Africa as more and more manufacturing firms have realized the importance\nof supplier performance in establishing and maintaining their competitive\nadvantage, purchasing research has tended to focus on supplier development\nprograms and explore how these initiatives impact on buyer and supplier\nperformance (Humphreys, 2001) which eventually leads to organizational\nimprovement. Supplier development is the process of working collaboratively with\nsuppliers to improve or expand their capabilities (Charles Dominick (2006).\nSupplier development contributes the companies in terms of creation and\nmaintenance of appropriate suppliers, quality, technicality, cost capability and\ndelivery with continuous improvement (Rajput and Bakar, 2012).\n1.2 Problem Statement\nFirms operate within complex and dynamic supply networks, where their ability to\nmanage suppliers and streamline their supply chain processes can significantly\nimpact their performance.

Introduction\nThis chapter reviews the existing literature put forward by different scholars and\npersonalities on the impact of supplier development on the performance of an\norganization.\n2.1. Supplier development.\nThis was defined as any effort of a buying firm on a supplier to increase the\nperformance and capabilities of the supplier to meet the buying firm's short and\nlong term supply needs, Krause and Ellram (1997). Supply development strategies\nincluded creating competitive environments among suppliers, supplier assessment\nand feedback communication, supplier certification programs, promised current\nand future benefits, site visit and training programs (Krause, 1997). Several studies\nsupported the positive effect of supplier development strategies on buyer and\nsupplier performance improvements (Monzcka et al, 1993, Humphreys et al, 2004,\nWagner 2006a: Modi and Mabert).\n\nAccording to Kenneth Lyons and Brian Farrington (2006), supplier development\nrefers to any activity that a buyer undertakes to improve a supplier's performance\nor capabilities to meet the buyer's short term and long term supply needs. Supplier\ndevelopment is actually developing suppliers in much the same way employees are\ndeveloped. This is done through training, tools, incentives that make them\nsuccessful in short; they invest in their employees because they know that great\nemployees are what makes companies.\nIn a literature review Krause (1997) found that the supplier development literature\nmainly consists of case studies, and that these case studies primarily come from the\nautomotive industry (Hines, 1994: Hartley and Choi, 1996). When investigating to\nwhat extent companies' work (Krause, 1997), with supplier development Krause\nfound three different approaches exercised by firms to increase supplier\nperformance namely:\n➢ Direct firm involvement that is hands on cooperation such as visits,\nevaluations, feedback and many more.\n➢ Incentive commitment that is, promises of future benefits if the supplier\nincreases his performance.\n➢ Enforced competition that is, the use of several suppliers for the same\ncomponents.\n\n2.2. The current supply development practices adopted by firms.\nA number of studies have described strategies that buying firms should adopt in\norder to improve the rate of supplier performance Monczka et al, (1993):\nVonderembse and Tracey, 1999; Carr et al, (2008); Krause, (1997).

These activities include introducing competition into the supply\nbase, supplier evaluation as a prerequisite to further supplier development\nactivities, raising performance expectations, recognition and rewards, the promise\nof future benefits, training and education of the supplier's personnel, exchange of\npersonnel between the buying firm and the supplier, and direct investment in the\nsupplier by the buying firm (Monczka et al. 1993). The purchasing literature has\nstressed the importance of supplier development in supporting a firm's operations\nstrategy by ensuring that suppliers' performance and capabilities meet the needs of\nthe buying firm Hahn (1990) :Hartley (1996): Monczka et al. (1993).\nOne of the purchasing function’s primary objectives is to maintain a network of\ncapable suppliers. As firms concentrate on their core competencies, they become\nmore dependent upon suppliers. Thus to compete, firms must ensure that their\nsuppliers’ performance and capabilities are equal to or greater than the\nperformance and capabilities of the firm’s competitors. However, companies report\nthat suppliers’ performance and/or capabilities are often deficient in areas such as\nquality, delivery, cost reduction, financial health, adopting new technologies, and\nhandling design changes. Thus, many firms actively facilitate supplier performance\nand capability improvements through supplier development. These activities\ninclude;\n\n❖ Firms may use a variety of activities to develop suppliers’ performance and/or\ncapabilities.\n❖ Introducing competition into the supply base, Use of 2 or 3 suppliers for this\npurchased item to create competition among suppliers.\n\n❖ Evaluating the supplier as a prerequisite to further supplier development\nactivities,\n❖ Raising performance expectations,\n❖ Recognizing good supplier performance,\n❖ Promising future benefits,\n❖ Training and educating the suppliers’\n❖ Exchanging personnel between the buying firm and the supplier, ❖ Investing\ndirectly in the supplier.", "word_count": 335, "start_char": 26905, "end_char": 29286}

Hendrick and Ellram’s study of\nbuyersupplier relationships yielded the following supplier comments: “The\nbenefits of a partnership program must be more balanced,” and “The customer\n\nreceives most of the benefits and the supplier receives few. “The trade literature\nalso provides similar supplier perceptions, i.e., that cooperative relationships are\noften cooperative only in name and that the supplier does more than its share of\ncooperating.\nIn addition, firms do not believe that suppliers’ performance is sufficient to support\ntheir competitive efforts. This notion is reflected in a recent survey of purchasing\nmanagers which revealed that suppliers are deficient in many areas. Thus firms\nmust increase the overall performance of their supply bases, and such an effort\nshould include effective communication of requirements and active facilitation of\nsuppliers’ performance and capabilities increases. A firm that engages in a supplier\ndevelopment effort may communicate through its effort that it is serious about the\nsupplier’s performance and willing to invest in the buyer-supplier relationship.\nSuppliers that benefit from supplier development efforts may subsequently\nperceive greater benefits from partnerships with their customers.\nFuture research efforts could explore the specific relationship between the duration\nand intensity of supplier development efforts, the type of supplier development\nactivities used, and the strength of positive results, both short and long term.\n\n2.3.

This may involve joint product development,\nsupplier capacity building, and the sharing of best practices.\n\nEffective supply development strategies recognize that suppliers are integral\npartners in the value chain. Carter and Rogers underscore the importance of\nsustainability and ethical considerations in supply development. Encouraging\nsustainable practices and ethical conduct among suppliers not only aligns with in\nCorporate social responsibility goals but also mitigates risks associated with\nnoncompliance and reputational damage.\n\n2.3.1. Critical success factors to supplier development.\nA review of the literature indicates that there are four factors affecting supplier\ndevelopment efforts. They have garnered impressive theoretical and practical\nsupport and are explained in the following sub- sections.\n\n❖ Supplier's commitment.\nMorgan and Hunt (1994) define relational commitment as the existence of beliefs\nheld by exchange partners that an ongoing relationship with another party is so\nimportant that maintaining it warrants maximum effort. Their study investigated\nthe association between relationship commitment and cooperation, the longevity of\nthe relationship, willingness to compromise, and trust in a tire manufacturer/", "word_count": 254, "start_char": 31846, "end_char": 33786}

They found commitment to be positively associated with all of the factors\nsurveyed. Similarly. Handfield Robert, (2000) insisted that lack of supplier\ncommitment will lead to the failed implementation of improvements related to the\nsupplier development program. ❖ Trust\nIn general trust is referred to as the belief in an exchange partner's honesty and\nbenevolence. Trust in an organization refers to the perception of honesty as the\nconfidence in the reliability and integrity of a trading partner Morgan Robert and\nHunt Shelby D, (1994) and motivation to rely on that confidence. Benevolence\nrepresents the belief that a trading partner is interested in and motivated to work for\nmutual welfare. McEvily and Perrone, (1998) advance this definition by adding\nthat trust in an organization depends on the degree of collectively held trust level of\norganizational members toward the partner firm, therefore making a link between\nindividual's trust and the organization as the view of trust in an organization is\ndeveloped by individuals who are representative of that organization. Trust\nmediates the relationship between supplier development and preferential buyer\nstatus.\n❖ Support from the supplier's top management.\nKrause (1997) conducted an empirical study to look at factors leading to the\nutilization of supplier development. He found that top management's recognition of\nthe purchasing function is a significant factor leading the buying firm to adopt the\nsupplier development. It was imperative for the supplier's top management to\nrecognize the need for continuous improvement (Monezka and Trent, 1993) as well\nas the benefits bestowed on both parties. Undertaking a supplier development\nprogram requires both the buyer and supplier to invest time, personnel and\nfinancial resources.\n\n❖ Communication.\nCarter and Ellram (1994) investigated the impact of inter-organizational alliances\nin improving supplier quality. They found that good communication and trust are\nrequired to facilitate information exchange regarding an organization's existing\ndesign to suppliers. In addition, a supplier needs to have a clear understanding of\nthe end product's final application. Such communication is critical to achieving the\ntrue benefits of quality improvement at the supplier level. Sparkman Robert,\n(1994) conclude that the higher the communication quality in buyer supplier\nrelationships as measured in terms of accuracy, timeliness, adequacy and\ncredibility, the higher is the satisfaction with buyer supplier relationships.", "word_count": 429, "start_char": 33386, "end_char": 36325}

However there are some challenges that organizations may face when they\ncarrying out supplier development; ❖ Supplier track record\nThe first step to take before engaging with any supplier is to go through his past\nand current projects and to investigate his knowledge about tax and legal\nimplication of exporting and importing. Knowing the supplier beforehand helps\nto create and build a healthy relations. ❖ Understanding the culture\nBelonging to a different culture may give rise to different views and interpretations\nwhile having the same conversation. ❖ Communication gap\nCommunication is absolutely necessary for many aspects of business. If a supplier\ndoesn't understand the company's strategic goals that may fulfill the needs and the\n\nrequirements due to poor results. Maintaining a good contact with the suppliers can\nbenefit the organization in a big way.\n❖ Non transparency of processes\nMany times, non-transparency of the supplier's process creates gaps in the\ncompany supplier relationship. Technology can play a crucial role to fill this gap.\nAnalyze the whole process more effectively by using online purchase order and\ninvoice management tools like invoice. ❖ The need to Nurture\nA healthy relation only nurtures when the two sides stay together for long.\nAbandoning the suppliers at the time of success may create stress in a relationship.\nTo avert this, one should include the supplier at every milestone and success\ncelebration of a company.\n❖ Supplier training\nIf the supplier doesn't understand, what the company wants its customers to\nexperience through their products, he won't be able to provide enough supplies.\nOne should make sure that the supplier knows the company's motto. They should\nbe given appropriate training to ensure expectation levels.\n\n❖ Damaged delivery\nAt times, the delivered product turn out to be damaged or flawed. Aggressive steps\nat such times can ruin a relationship. One should notify the supplier respectfully\nand ask him to replace it. A healthy balance maintained while taking steps against\nsuppliers who are underperforming. A healthy balance manages underperforming\nsuppliers.", "word_count": 381, "start_char": 35973, "end_char": 38466}

The effect of supplier training on the performance of an organization.\nSupplier training has the distinct role in the achievement of an organizational goal\nby incorporating the interests of organization and workforce, (Stone R.J, 2002).\nCurrently, supplier training is the most important factor in the business world\nbecause training increases the efficiency, performance and the effectiveness of both\nsuppliers and the organization.\nSupplier training helps suppliers to improve on their skills and knowledge which\nhelp them to deal with many organizations. Training program brings all the\nsuppliers to a higher level so that they all have similar skills and knowledge. This\nhelps to reduce any weak links within the company who rely heavily on others to\ncomplete basic work tasks.\nSupplier training improves supplier performance Suppliers who receive the\nnecessary training are able to perform their tasks and responsibilities which\nimproves on their performance. This training may also build the supplier's\nconfidence because a supplier has a stronger understanding of the industry and the\nresponsibilities of his job. This confidence may push him to perform even better\nand think of new ideas that will help him to excel. Continuous training also helps\nsuppliers on the cutting edge of industry developments. Suppliers who are\ncompetent and on top of changing industry standards can help your company hold\na position as a lender and strong competitor within the industry.\nSupplier training creates consistency. A structured and development program\nensures that suppliers have a consistent experience and background knowledge.\nThe consistency is particularly relevant for the company's basic policies and\nprocedures. All suppliers need to be aware of the expectations and procedures\nwithin the company. This include safety, discrimination and administrative tasks.", "word_count": 317, "start_char": 38196, "end_char": 40339}

For example while improved\nsupplier capabilities can sustainably Assist the customer firm in its attainment of a\ndifferentiation strategy, better product and delivery performance can also help\n(though to a lower degree) firms in the attainment of a differentiation strategy,\n(Carter & Ellram, 1994). Examples of buyer's investments in suppliers, with\nreference to social capital and resource based view theory, refer to indirect and\ndirect supplier development programs Wagner, (2006) Krause et al, (2000).\nSuppliers with access to training and development programs have the advantage\nover suppliers in other organizations who are left to seek out training opportunities\non their own. The investment in training that an organization makes shows that the\nsuppliers are valued. The training creates a supportive workforce. Suppliers who\nfeel appreciated and challenged through training opportunities may feel more\nsatisfaction towards their jobs and responsibilities.\n\nPrograms for supplier development that receive assistance from buyers can be\nregarded as buyer support training. The literature suggests that buyers have various\nways of supporting their suppliers with some buyers giving more support than\nothers. Some buyers focus on short term benefits while others look at supplier\ndevelopment as a long term investment. Thus suppliers have access to different\ntypes of supplier development programs depending on their buyers. This means\nthat the types of training that would most benefit suppliers could be best assessed\nthrough studies focusing on the supplier perspective. By identifying the relevant\ntypes of training buyer- supported training programs could increase. This would be\n\nbecause buyers could select the type of training suitable for specific groups of\nsuppliers. The right type of training could then lead to an increase in performance\nfor the supplier which would in turn encourage an increase in buyer supported\ntraining. Buyer may send his employees or group of team to train supplier or he\nmay invite group of suppliers facing some problem for training in his own firm\nAmbrose et al (2008).", "word_count": 410, "start_char": 39946, "end_char": 42720}

(2011) made a case study in Malaysian automotive industry on patterns\nof supplier learning. Here they found that supplier development programs support\nthe development of a supplier's capabilities usually with the assistance of a buyer.\nSupplier development also depends on supplier's interest and how they explore\nthem self to increase their capabilities. Although local suppliers do receive\nassistance from their buyers but this type of assistance is still not adequate to\nimprove supplier capabilities. Therefore analyzing environment that provides\nbuyer support training could help to identify factors that suppliers themselves seem\nimportant for development of their capabilities. It is claimed that support from\nbuyers for suppliers training has been deficient. Thus there is a need to identify the\ntypes of training that suppliers themselves prefer. Buyers themselves have\nsignificant knowledge of the training that a supplier might need but as technology\ndevelopment happens the buyer no longer has a hold on all of the technology that\nis involved or coming. Thus it is important that suppliers looking to develop their\ncapabilities have access to the type of training that they require which may or may\nnot be provided by their buyers. For suppliers that have access to buyer supported\ntraining their training needs might often change as they develop their own\ncapabilities, (Nadia et al 2011).", "word_count": 278, "start_char": 42389, "end_char": 44137}

By exercising such capabilities through\norganizational processes, suppliers are able to support their customer's\ndifferentiation strategy. Although improved supplier capabilities which are\nembedded within the supplier organization have a rather medium to long term\nfocus and are likely to sustain over a longer period of time, improving the supplier\nfirm's delivery performance or quality of specific product can also have a positive\nimpact on the customer firm's attainment of a differentiation strategy more\nimmediate and only short term, (Hartley and Gwen) 1997.\n2.5. In summary, supplier development involves;\n• Embracing supplier expertise and aligning it to the buyers' needs\n• Might involve developing suppliers' business like evaluation and redesign of\ntheir corporate strategy\n• Principles of change management and require visible commitment from both\nparties' top management teams.\n• Value management/ analysis to reduce the cost of product without\ndiminishing operational value.\n\nCHAPTER THREE\nRESEARCH METHODOLOGY\n\n3.0 Introduction\nThis chapter explains the approaches the researcher used to gain information on the\nresearch problem and includes the research design, study population and sample\nsize, sampling design and procedure, data collection methods, measurement of\nvariables. Procedure of data collection, data processing analysis, presentation, and\nanticipated problems to the study and their solutions.\n3.1 Research design\n\nDescriptive survey was the research design that was used since it was as concerned\nwith describing how supplier development affects the performance of an\norganization. According to Mugenda and Mugenda (2009) a descriptive survey is\nan attempt to collect data from members of a population in order to determine the\ncurrent status of that population with respect to one or more variables. The purpose\nof employing this method was to describe the nature of a situation, as it existed at\nthe time of the study and to explore the impact of supplier development on the\norganizational performance.\n3.2 Study population", "word_count": 397, "start_char": 43801, "end_char": 46460}

The\nsurvey population consisted of 100 staff members. This population included the\nsales representatives, procurement department, transportation department,\nadministration and other employees holding familiar and unfamiliar titles but\ndeemed suitable stakeholders for generating relevant data to the problem which is\nunder investigation.\n\n3.3 Sampling technique\n\nSampling is the process by which relatively a small number of individuals or\nmeasures of individuals, objects or event is selected and analyzed in order to find\nout something about the entire population from which it was selected. Under this\nstudy, stratified sampling was used where the researcher divided the entire\npopulation into different subgroups or strata, then randomly selected the final\nsubjects proportionally from the different strata. Stratified random sampling was\nused because it reduces selection bias. Stratifying the entire population before\napplying random sampling methods helped to ensure a sample that accurately\nreflected the population being studied in terms of the criteria used for stratification.\n3.4. Sample size\nThis refers to the act of choosing the number of observations or replicates to\ninclude in a statistical sample. The sample size is an important feature of any\nempirical study in which the goal is to make inferences about the population from a\nsample. Seventy one employees (71% of the target population) from four\ndirectorates were selected as a sample According to Mugenda (2009) a sample size\nof 10%-30% of a target population is adequate enough to make a generalization.\nTherefore, the sample was large enough to make a generalization about the\npopulation.\n\nTable 1.

This is where the studies are conducted spanning over\na larger period of time.\n3.6 Data collection instruments\nThis refers to the process of gathering and measuring information on targeted\nvariables in an established systematic fashion which enables one to answer relevant\nquestions and evaluate outcomes. Data collection instruments include:\nquestionnaire, interviews, surveys, observations. Group focus among others.\n3.6.1 Questionnaire\nThis refers to a set of printed or written questions with a choice of answers, devised\nfor the purpose of a survey or statistical study. It's a research instrument consisting\nof a series of questions for the purpose of gathering information from respondents.\nQuestionnaires were used to collect mainly quantitative data. This was due to the\nfact that they allow in depth research, firsthand information and more experience\nover a short period of time (Korari, 2008; Amin, 2005: Creswell, 2003). However\nsome qualitative data was collected from the open ended questions. The research\nwas administered using questionnaires given to each member of the get population.\nThe questionnaire was designed and tested with a few members of the population\nfor further improvements. This was done in order to enhance its validity and\naccuracy of data to be collected. The questionnaire was inverted by the statistical\nsociety of London in 1838.

In common practice, the word interview\nrefers to one on one conversation with one person acting in the role of the\ninterviewer and the other in the role of the interviewee. An interview is a dialogue\nbetween an interviewer and interviewee (Mugenda and Mugenda, 1999). It is an\norganized conservation aimed at gathering data about a particular topic. The\nfollowing are some of the advantages of interviews;\n\n▪ Accurate screening. Face to face interviews help with more accurate\nscreening. The individual being interviewed is unable to provide false\ninformation during screening questions such as gender, race and many\nothers.\n\n▪ Keep focus. The interviewer is the one that has control over the interview\nand can keep the interviewee focused and on track to completion.\n\n▪ Capture emotions and behaviors. Face to face interviews can no doubt\ncapture an interviewee's emotions and behaviors.\n\n3.7. Data processing and Analysis\nData processing refers to the collection and manipulation of items of data to\nproduce meaningful information while data analysis involves techniques performed\non data that help describe facts, detect patterns, develop explanations and test\nhypothesis. This includes data quality assurance statistical data analysis, modeling\nand interpretation of results. Under data processing and analysis both qualitative\nand quantitative data was generated and analyzed. Descriptive statistics\n(percentages) were computed for all the four objectives.

The limitations the researcher faced included:\n\n➢ Accessibility. The researcher carried out his research in Nile Breweries\nalong the Jinja- Kampala highway in Jinja District which was not his home\narea so when it came to accessing employees of the organization to give\ninformation to be used in research it became difficult. The researcher went to\nthe organization twice for a period of 2 weeks in order to get information\nthat was needed to complete the research in order to solve the problem of\naccessibility.\n\n➢ Costly. Carrying out research was costly in that it involves a lot of time and\nfinances like transportation from Mukono to Jinja in order to complete the\nresearch. The researcher utilized the available resources in the most\nappropriate way in order to complete the research in time.\n\n➢ Lack of reliable data. This came as a limitation in that the researcher was\nnot an employee of an organization so accessing reliable information\n\nbecame a limitation to his research. This limitation was solved by creating\ngood relationship with the employees and stakeholders of the organization\nand also using internet to get enough reliable data to complete research.\n\nCHAPTER FOUR\nDATA ANALYSIS, INTERPRESENTATION AND PRESENTATION OF\nTHEFINDINGS.\n\n4.0 Introduction.\n\nThis chapter presents data analysis, interpretation, and presentation of the findings.\nThe findings were based on the primary data collected from the field with the aid\nof the self-administered questionnaires.
