In order to find derivatives of such functions one is forced to use methods\nbased on the available discrete data and the methods are purely numerical.\nSometimes, some functions with known analytical expressions, their derivatives may be so\ncomplex and computationally involved in their evaluation that one must resort to numerical\nmethods, though less accurate, but have less involved expressions.\nThroughout numerical weather prediction, you often need to calculate the gradient of a function\nat a number of points. As we rarely know the equation which defines the function, we need to\ncalculate numerically an estimate of the gradient. This method requires the use of finite difference schemes. In this module we will be considering finite difference schemes to approximate\nthe gradient of a function in one variable. The problem can be stated more specifically in these\nterms: how to estimate the gradient of a function in f(x), at a point a.\nNumerical differentiation is the process of finding the numerical value of a derivative of a given\nfunction at a given point. In general, numerical differentiation is more difficult than numerical integration.\nThis is because while numerical integration requires only good continuity\nproperties of the function being integrated, numerical differentiation requires more complicated\nproperties such as Lipschitz classes.\n3.1.2\nAnalytic definition of a derivative as compared to a numerical\ndefinition\nAnalytically, we define the derivative of f(x) at x = a denoted f ′(x) as the limiting process,\nf ′(x) = lim\nh→0\nh\n.\nHowever, a numerical approximation to f ′(x) involves a difference such as\nΦ(h) = f(x + h) −f(x)\nh\nIn geometrical terms, this can be represented as in Figure 3.1.\n\n3.1. INTRODUCTION\nFigure 3.1: Geometrical interpretation of a derivative\nNote 3.1.1\nf ′(x) is the slope of the tangent T and, Φ(h) is the slope of the line L.\nAs\nh →0, Φ(h) →f ′(x) suggesting that h should be small for a good approximation. However, in\ncomputing Φ(h) the two terms f(x) and f(x + h) are close in value. So there is likely to be a\nloss of significant digits.\nPage 51 of 196", "word_count": 380, "start_char": 0, "end_char": 2333}

Thus maximum error in\nf(x + h) is 1\n210−4 = 0.00005\nand maximum absolute error in\nf(x) is 1\n210−4 = 0.00005.\nBut the error in the difference is a sum of the absolute errors in the individual numbers.

Such a behavior is common from tables of well-behaved functions like polynomials.\n4.1.2\nFinite difference operators\nThe most common finite difference operators are; the forward difference operator, the backward difference operator, the central difference operator, the averaging operator and the shift\noperator.\nPage 65 of 196\n\n4.2\nThe Forward Difference Operator ∆\nThe forward difference operator is denoted by ∆and defined by the difference equation;\n∆fr = fr+1 −fr\n(4.1)\nThus, the 1st difference column in a difference table consists of the elements,\n∆f0,\n∆f1,\n∆f2 . . . . . .\nThe second differences are got by differentiating the first differences i.e\n∆fr+1 −∆fr\n(4.2)\nBut we can easily show that ∆is a linear operator i.e.\n∆(αfr + βgr) = α∆fr + β∆gr\nThus equation (4.2), becomes,\n∆fr+1 −∆fr = ∆(fr+1 −fr) = ∆(∆fr).\nExample 4.2.1\nLet y = f(x).
