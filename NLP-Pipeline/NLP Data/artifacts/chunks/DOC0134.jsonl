The objectives of the research were to identify the different types of\nleadership employed, assess employee performance levels, and propose strategies to\nimprove leadership practices and overall performance within the organization. The\nstudy adopted a cross-sectional research design, targeting a population of 120\nemployees across managers, supervisors, and subordinate staff, with a sample size of\n92 determined using Krejcie and Morgan’s (1970) table. Stratified random sampling\nand simple random sampling techniques were employed to select respondents, while\ndata were collected using structured questionnaires. Both primary and secondary data\nsources were utilized, with primary data capturing employee perceptions on\nleadership styles transformational, transactional, democratic, autocratic, and laissezfaire and their effects on performance. Data were analyzed using descriptive and\ninferential statistics, including frequencies, percentages, means, standard deviations,\nand correlation analysis, and results were presented through tables, charts, and\ngraphs.\nFindings revealed that transformational, transactional, and democratic leadership\nstyles were predominantly practiced, with transformational leadership having the\nmost significant influence on employee motivation, teamwork, innovation, and overall\nperformance. Autocratic leadership was moderately applied, while laissez-faire\nleadership was least practiced. The study further identified strategies to enhance\nleadership effectiveness, including regular leadership training, participatory decisionmaking, reward and recognition systems, open communication channels, and\nmentorship programs. The study concludes that effective leadership positively\nimpacts employee performance and recommends that Centenary Bank strengthen\nleadership practices to foster a motivated, productive, and committed workforce.\nFuture research is suggested on the role of organizational culture, employee\nmotivation, and job satisfaction in shaping leadership effectiveness.\n\nviii\nKeywords:Leadership styles, Employee performance, Transformational leadership,\nTransactional leadership, Democratic leadership, Centenary Bank.", "word_count": 383, "start_char": 5363, "end_char": 9280}

It encompasses various dimensions such as decision-making\npatterns, communication styles, and the degree of involvement given to subordinates\nin organizational processes. Common leadership styles include transformational\nleadership, which focuses on inspiring and empowering employees; transactional\nleadership, which emphasizes clear structures, rewards, and penalties; and laissezfaire leadership, which involves minimal interference and autonomy for employees.\nEmployee performance, on the other hand, refers to the extent to which employees\neffectively execute their roles and responsibilities to achieve set targets and\ncontribute to the overall productivity and success of an organization. High employee\nperformance is often characterized by efficiency, innovation, commitment, and\nalignment with organizational objectives.\nNumerous studies have established that leadership style significantly affects employee\nperformance and workplace behavior. For instance, Bass and Avolio (2004) noted that\ntransformational leadership enhances motivation, satisfaction, and innovation by\nfostering a sense of purpose and professional development among employees.\nTransactional leadership has been linked to the achievement of short-term goals\nthrough structured supervision and reward systems (Judge & Piccolo, 2004), while\nlaissez-faire leadership, characterized by passive decision-making, is often associated\nwith reduced motivation and lower productivity (Skogstad et al., 2007). Robbins and\nJudge (2017) emphasized that effective leadership goes beyond directing employees", "word_count": 318, "start_char": 8771, "end_char": 11293}

Similarly, Tyagi (2021) argued that leadership effectiveness is\ncritical for employee retention, engagement, and overall organizational productivity.\nHowever, organizations, particularly in the banking sector, face practical challenges\nin applying effective leadership styles that enhance performance. Leaders often\nencounter difficulties such as managing diverse workforce expectations, resistance to\nchange, and maintaining high employee morale under strict regulatory and\nperformance pressures (Al Khajeh, 2018). Communication gaps between managers and\nemployees frequently lead to misunderstandings and disengagement, affecting overall\nproductivity (Iqbal et al., 2020).\nFurthermore, leaders struggle with adapting their leadership styles to the evolving\nworkplace dynamics driven by technological change and increased competition\n(Mwesigwa et al., 2021). High employee turnover and burnout have also been\nreported as critical challenges, especially where leadership fails to foster a supportive\nand motivating environment (Babalola et al., 2022). These challenges are particularly\nevident in financial institutions like Centenary Bank, where leadership plays a crucial\nrole in influencing employee motivation, workplace commitment, and overall\nproductivity. This study, therefore, seeks to examine how different leadership styles\nimpact employee performance at Centenary Bank and explore strategies for\novercoming leadership challenges to foster better workplace outcomes.\n1.2 Statement of the problem\nEmployee performance is a critical determinant of organizational success, particularly\nin the banking sector, where service quality and customer satisfaction depend heavily\non employee motivation and engagement. At Centenary Bank, leadership styles\ndefined as the approaches leaders use to direct, motivate, and manage employees\n(Northouse, 2018) play a crucial role in shaping workplace culture and influencing\nperformance outcomes. Transformational leadership, which inspires and motivates\nemployees through a shared vision and personal development, has been linked to\nincreased morale, creativity, and productivity. Similarly, democratic leadership,", "word_count": 340, "start_char": 10879, "end_char": 13558}

In contrast, autocratic leadership, characterized by\ncentralized decision-making and limited employee involvement, often results in low\nmorale and high turnover, while laissez-faire leadership, which provides minimal\nguidance and oversight, can lead to disengagement and reduced productivity (Yukl,\n2013). In Uganda’s competitive and customer-driven banking sector, understanding\nhow these leadership styles influence employee performance is vital for enhancing\nmotivation, improving service delivery, and promoting organizational growth.\n1.3 Main objective of the study\nThe purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of leadership styles on\nemployee performance, using Centenary Bank as a case study.\n1.4 Objectives of the study\ni.\nTo find out the different types of leadership at centenary bank\nii.\nTo find out performance levels at bank\niii.\nTo suggest possible ways to improve leadership and performance at the bank\n1.5 Research questions\ni) What are the different leadership styles at Centenary bank?\nii) How do different leadership styles affect employee performance?\niii) What are possible ways leadership can be improved at Centenary bank ?\n1.6 Scope of the study\n1.6.1 Subject scope\nThe study explored the relationship between leadership styles and employee\nperformance\nwithin Centenary Bank.

It also deals with the actual review of literature that was done by\nprevious scholars objective by objective and the gap available in the literature of\nprevious studies. The rationale of the literature review is to discuss the existing\nliterature with the objective of revealing contribution made by earlier scholars,\nweaknesses and gaps in existing knowledge and lessons learnt.\n2.1 The different types of leadership\nTransformational leadership is widely regarded as\none of the most effective\nleadership styles because it emphasizes inspiring and motivating employees to achieve\ntheir highest potential. A study by Hoch et al. (2018) revealed that transformational\nleaders significantly enhance employee engagement and job satisfaction by providing\nvision and fostering innovation. Similarly, Alonderiene and Majauskaite (2016) found\nthat transformational leadership positively correlates with organizational learning and\nadaptability, especially in dynamic environments.\nResearch also shows its role in improving organizational performance. For instance,\nSuong et al. (2021) examined Vietnamese SMEs and found that transformational\nleadership positively influences innovation performance through knowledge-sharing", "word_count": 431, "start_char": 14985, "end_char": 18250}

(2021) examined Vietnamese SMEs and found that transformational\nleadership positively influences innovation performance through knowledge-sharing\n\npractices. Additionally, transformational leadership has been linked to increased\nemployee commitment and reduced turnover intentions (Choi et al., 2017). These\nfindings collectively suggest that transformational leadership enhances both individual\nand organizational outcomes.\nTransactional leadership focuses on structured tasks, rewards, and punishments to\nachieve desired performance levels. Despite being considered less inspiring than\ntransformational leadership, it remains relevant in various contexts. According to\nBreevaart et al. (2014), transactional leaders improve short-term performance\nthrough clear goal setting and reward systems. Likewise, Podsakoff et al. (2018)\nindicated that transactional leadership is effective in highly regulated industries,\nwhere compliance and procedural accuracy are critical.\nHowever, empirical studies reveal mixed results regarding its long-term effectiveness.\nA study by Abbas et al. (2015) showed that while transactional leadership promotes\nefficiency and goal achievement, it has a weaker association with innovation and\nemployee\ncreativity\ncompared\nto\ntransformational\nTherefore,\ntransactional leadership is most effective in stable environments requiring structured\nperformance management.\nServant leadership, which prioritizes employees' well-being and development, has\ngained attention in recent years. Liden et al. (2015) demonstrated that servant\nleaders enhance employee trust and organizational citizenship behavior (OCB).\nSimilarly, Eva et al. (2019), in a meta-analysis, reported that servant leadership\nsignificantly improves team performance, commitment, and psychological safety.\nIn non-profit and educational settings, servant leadership has shown particularly\nstrong results. For example, Saleem et al. (2020) observed that servant leadership in\nhigher education institutions in Pakistan positively influences faculty motivation and\nknowledge sharing. These findings indicate that servant leadership contributes to\nsustainable organizational growth by emphasizing employee-centric values.", "word_count": 302, "start_char": 17817, "end_char": 20308}

(2020) observed that servant leadership in\nhigher education institutions in Pakistan positively influences faculty motivation and\nknowledge sharing.T\n\nhese findings indicate that servant leadership contributes to\nsustainable organizational growth by emphasizing employee-centric values.\n\nDemocratic leadership, characterized by participative decision-making, empowers\nemployees and fosters inclusivity. Empirical research suggests that democratic\nleadership positively affects employee morale and job satisfaction. According to\nHidayat and Nugroho (2020), democratic leadership in manufacturing firms led to\nimproved teamwork and reduced workplace conflict. Moreover, democratic leaders\nfacilitate innovation because employees feel valued and included in decision-making\n(Nanjundeswaraswamy& Swamy, 2015).\nHowever, democratic leadership is time-consuming and may not be ideal in crisis\nsituations where quick decisions are necessary (Jony et al., 2019). Despite these\nlimitations, its emphasis on collaboration makes it effective in knowledge-based and\ncreative industries.\nAutocratic leadership involves centralized decision-making and strict control. While\noften criticized for its rigidity, it remains useful in certain environments. For\nexample, Osei-Tutu et al. (2020) found that autocratic leadership enhanced\nperformance in military and security organizations where discipline and hierarchical\nstructure are essential. Similarly, research by Iqbal et al. (2015) showed that\nautocratic leadership can be effective in high-pressure situations that require quick\nand unilateral decision-making.\nNevertheless, studies indicate that autocratic leadership often leads to lower\nemployee satisfaction and higher turnover intentions compared to participative styles\n(Hao &Yazdanifard, 2015). Hence, autocratic leadership may be contextually effective\nbut less suitable for organizations seeking employee empowerment and innovation.\nLaissez-faire leadership, characterized by minimal leader intervention, has mixed\nempirical support. Some studies indicate that it encourages creativity among selfmotivated employees (Skogstad et al., 2017). However, others associate it with\nreduced performance and employee dissatisfaction when guidance is insufficient\n(Harms et al., 2017).", "word_count": 296, "start_char": 19897, "end_char": 22294}

Therefore, laissez-faire leadership tends to be effective only in\nhighly skilled, self-directed teams that require minimal oversight.\nEmpirical research highlights that different leadership styles impact organizational\noutcomes differently depending on the context. Transformational and servant\nleadership emerge as highly effective in fostering innovation, employee satisfaction,\nand long-term growth. Transactional and autocratic leadership are effective in\nstructured, high-pressure environments but may limit creativity. Democratic\nleadership enhances collaboration and inclusivity but may slow decision-making, while\nlaissez-faire leadership works only in highly autonomous teams. Leaders must\ntherefore adopt a situational approach, selecting styles that align with organizational\ngoals, workforce characteristics, and environmental conditions.\n2.2Leadership styles and performance levels\nSeveral studies have demonstrated that transformational leadership significantly\nenhances organizational and employee performance. For instance, Alqatawenh (2018)\nconducted an empirical study in Jordanian public sector organizations and found that\ntransformational leadership behaviors, such as inspiration, intellectual stimulation,\nand individualized consideration, positively influence employees’ job performance.\nSimilarly, Pradhan and Jena (2017) found that transformational leadership has a direct\nand positive effect on employee performance through the mediating role of job\nengagement and motivation, confirming the critical role leaders play in inspiring\nemployees to achieve higher performance levels. More recent research by Al Khajeh\n(2018) and Abasilim et al. (2019) revealed that transformational leaders create an\nenvironment of trust and collaboration, which increases employee commitment and\nproductivity, ultimately improving organizational performance.\nTransactional leadership, characterized by reward and punishment mechanisms, has\nalso been studied extensively in relation to performance. According to Yahaya and\nEbrahim (2016), transactional leadership significantly impacts task performance by", "word_count": 338, "start_char": 21810, "end_char": 24588}
{"chunk_id": "DOC0134__00009", "doc_id": "DOC0134", "chunk_index": 9, "text": "ransactional leadership, characterized by reward and punishment mechanisms, has\nalso been studied extensively in relation to performance.A\n\nccording to Yahaya and\nEbrahim (2016), transactional leadership significantly impacts task performance by\n\nproviding clear structures and performance-based rewards. In a study conducted by\nOthman et al. (2020) among Malaysian manufacturing firms, transactional leadership\nwas found to positively influence operational performance metrics, including\nefficiency and output quality, although its impact on innovation-related performance\nwas limited. Similarly, Aydin, Sarier, and Uysal (2019) revealed that transactional\nleaders are effective in situations where employees require strict adherence to\nprocedures, which improves short-term performance but may limit creative problemsolving. These findings suggest that while transactional leadership can be effective in\nperformance optimization, it is context-dependent and may not foster long-term\ninnovative performance.\nThe emergence of servant leadership research has added a humanistic dimension to\nleadership studies. Empirical evidence shows that servant leadership positively\ninfluences both individual and organizational performance by focusing on the growth\nand well-being of employees. Eva et al. (2019) conducted a meta-analysis and\nconcluded that servant leadership significantly improves employee performance by\nfostering a supportive environment and building trust. Moreover, studies by Ling, Liu,\nand Wu (2022) highlighted that servant leadership enhances team performance by\npromoting collaboration, ethical conduct, and employee empowerment, especially in\nknowledge-driven industries. These findings emphasize that leaders who prioritize the\nneeds of employees contribute to sustainable performance outcomes and long-term\norganizational success.\nEthical leadership has gained prominence due to increasing attention to corporate\ngovernance and ethical conduct. According to Bedi, Alpaslan, and Green (2016),\nethical leadership is positively associated with employees’ organizational commitment\nand performance, largely due to increased trust and job satisfaction.

(2021) found that ethical\n\nleadership significantly influences employee creativity and organizational citizenship\nbehavior, which are vital components of overall performance in modern organizations.\nThese studies underscore that ethical leaders enhance performance by building\nintegrity and reducing unethical workplace behaviors.\nRecent studies have explored leadership’s impact on performance within digitally\ndriven and remote work contexts. According to Dirani et al. (2020), effective\nleadership during remote work settings, such as those necessitated by the COVID-19\npandemic, significantly determined employees’ engagement and productivity. Leaders\nwho adopted adaptive and inclusive approaches were able to sustain high\nperformance levels despite the challenges of remote work (Carnevale &Hatak, 2020).\nSimilarly, Wang et al. (2021) reported that digital leadership, which focuses on\ntechnological adaptation and employee support in virtual environments, has become\nincreasingly critical for maintaining high organizational performance in post-pandemic\nsettings. These findings suggest that leadership styles must evolve to meet the\nchanging needs of digital workplaces to sustain performance levels.\nIn developing economies, leadership plays an even more critical role due to resource\nconstraints and challenging operating environments. For example, Odumeru and\nOgbonna (2018) in their study of Nigerian SMEs found that leadership style accounted\nfor a significant proportion of performance variance, with transformational and\nparticipative leadership styles yielding superior results compared to autocratic styles.\nSimilarly, Onah and Okeke (2022) examined Ugandan financial institutions and\nconcluded that leadership practices focusing on employee development and\nempowerment significantly improved both individual and organizational performance.\nThese studies emphasize that leadership effectiveness is context-specific and must\nalign with organizational resources and socio-economic conditions to optimize\nperformance outcomes.\nEmpirical evidence consistently demonstrates that leadership significantly impacts\nperformance levels across sectors and regions.

The\nrise of digital and remote work environments has also necessitated new leadership\napproaches to sustain performance levels. The reviewed studies indicate that leaders\nwho inspire, support, and ethically guide employees foster superior performance\noutcomes, emphasizing the importance of dynamic and context-specific leadership\npractices.\n2.3 Possible ways to improve leadership and performance\nLeadership development programs have been consistently highlighted as a key driver\nin improving leadership effectiveness and organizational performance. According to\nAvolio et al. (2014), structured training programs, including coaching, mentoring, and\nexperiential learning, significantly enhance leaders' competencies and decisionmaking capabilities. These programs enable leaders to develop emotional\nintelligence, conflict management skills, and strategic vision, which are directly\nlinked to increased team productivity and organizational growth. Recent studies show\nthat organizations investing in continuous leadership training experienced a 17%\nimprovement in employee engagement and a 12% rise in overall organizational\nperformance (Brimhall, 2019). Furthermore, the shift toward digital training\nplatforms and virtual leadership programs during and after the COVID-19 pandemic\naccelerated leadership skill acquisition, leading to adaptive leadership approaches in\ndynamic environments (Lacerenza et al., 2021).\nTransformational leadership, which emphasizes inspiring and motivating employees,\nhas been strongly correlated with improved performance outcomes. Leaders who\nadopt transformational practices foster innovation, trust, and commitment among\nemployees (Bass & Riggio, 2019). A study by Khan et al. (2020) revealed that\ntransformational leadership significantly influences employee performance through\nmediators such as job satisfaction and organizational citizenship behavior. Leaders\nexhibiting transformational traits encourage creativity and collaboration, which drive\nproductivity in knowledge-intensive industries. Additionally, empirical evidence from\na meta-analysis of 95 studies indicated that transformational leadership accounts for", "word_count": 320, "start_char": 28596, "end_char": 31273}

These findings imply that leadership interventions focusing on\ntransformational behavior can yield sustainable improvements in performance\nmetrics.\nAnother avenue for improving leadership and performance is empowering employees\nthrough participative decision-making and autonomy. Studies have shown that leaders\nwho adopt participative leadership styles and encourage employees to contribute\nideas achieve better performance outcomes due to enhanced employee ownership\nand motivation (Zhang & Bartol, 2019). For example, Babalola et al. (2021) found that\nparticipative leaders improve job satisfaction and reduce turnover intention, which\npositively impacts overall productivity. Empowerment strategies such as shared goal\nsetting, transparent communication, and delegation of authority have been shown to\nincrease intrinsic motivation and creativity (Amundsen & Martinsen, 2015). A\nlongitudinal study by Xu et al. (2022) found that organizations adopting participative\nleadership improved financial performance by 15% over three years due to higher\ninnovation and employee commitment levels.\nThe digital transformation of leadership practices has become a major trend\ninfluencing organizational performance. Leaders are increasingly leveraging artificial\nintelligence (AI), big data analytics, and virtual collaboration platforms to enhance\ndecision-making and performance management (Northouse, 2021). Empirical studies\nreveal that technology-driven leadership, often associated with e-leadership,\nenhances operational efficiency and team collaboration, especially in remote and\nhybrid work environments (Contreras et al., 2020). For instance, a study by\nCortellazzo et al. (2019) indicated that leaders who effectively integrate digital tools\ninto their leadership practices experience improved team productivity and innovation.\nMoreover, post-pandemic research shows that digital leadership directly correlates\nwith higher adaptability and resilience in uncertain environments (El-Said, 2023).\nThese findings suggest that technological adoption is a critical pathway for leaders\nseeking to improve organizational performance.", "word_count": 336, "start_char": 30805, "end_char": 33510}

Leaders who create a culture of accountability,\ninclusivity, and continuous learning tend to influence employees’ attitudes positively,\nresulting in improved performance outcomes (Schein, 2017). Empirical evidence\nsuggests that organizations with leaders promoting a supportive culture experience\n30% higher employee engagement and 25% better retention (Groysberg et al., 2018).\nRecent studies also emphasize the importance of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI)\ninitiatives in leadership, as inclusive leadership styles are strongly linked to creativity,\ninnovation, and reduced turnover (Shore et al., 2021). This indicates that fostering\ninclusive cultural values and aligning them with leadership behavior can significantly\nenhance organizational performance.\nFinally, improving leadership effectiveness and performance requires integrating\nrobust feedback and performance measurement systems. Leaders who regularly\nprovide constructive feedback and performance appraisals foster continuous learning\nand improvement among employees (London & Smither, 2019). Empirical studies\nindicate that leaders utilizing data-driven performance monitoring systems\ndemonstrate\nbetter\ndecision-making,\nresulting\nin\nimproved\nindividual\nand\norganizational outcomes (Pulakos et al., 2020). For example, Kerns (2021) found that\norganizations that established regular performance dialogues between leaders and\nemployees reported 18% higher productivity levels and improved goal alignment.\nThese findings suggest that leadership approaches emphasizing feedback and\naccountability mechanisms play a critical role in performance improvement.", "word_count": 250, "start_char": 33213, "end_char": 35258}

It covered\nthe research design, study population, sample size, sampling techniques, sources of\ndata, data collection methods, data collection instruments, data analysis and\npresentation, and ethical considerations.\n3.1 Research design\nThe study adopted a cross-sectional research design. This design allowed for the\ncollection and analysis of data at a single point in time from the selected\nrespondents. The design was suitable because it enabled the researcher to study\nvarious leadership styles and how they influenced employee performance within the\nbank without manipulating any variables.\n3.2 Study population\nThe study targeted employees of Centenary Bank branches located in Kampala Central\nBusiness District. The population consisted of 120 employees, including managers,\nsupervisors, and subordinate staff (Centenary Bank Human Resource Report, 2024).\n3.3 Sample size\nGiven that studying the entire population was not practical due to time and resource\nconstraints, a manageable number of respondents was selected. The sample size was\ndetermined using Krejcie and Morgan’s (1970) table, which recommended a sample\nsize of 92 for a population of 120.\nTable 3.3: Sample size distribution\nCategory\nPopulation\nSample size\n\nManagers\nSupervisors\nSubordinate staff\nTotal\n3.4 Sampling technique\nThe study used stratified random sampling to ensure representation from different\nemployee categories, namely managers, supervisors, and subordinate staff. After\nstratification, simple random sampling was used to select respondents within each\ncategory, ensuring that every individual had an equal chance of inclusion. This\napproach minimized selection bias and enhanced the representativeness of the\nsample.\n3.5 Sources of data\nThe study relied on both primary and secondary sources of data.\n3.5.1 Primary data\nPrimary data was obtained directly from respondents using structured questionnaires.\nThis data was important because it provided firsthand information about employees’\nperceptions of leadership styles and their impact on performance.\n3.5.2 Secondary data\nSecondary data was obtained by reviewing existing literature, including Centenary\nBank annual reports, published journals, books, and other relevant documents. This\ndata provided background information and support for the study findings.\n3.6 Data collection instruments\nThe study used questionnaires as the main data collection instrument.\n3.6.1 Questionnaire\nThe questionnaire consisted of both closed and open-ended questions designed to\ncapture data on leadership styles (e.g., transformational, transactional, and laissezfaire) and their impact on employee performance.

Descriptive statistics such as\nfrequencies and percentages were used to summarize demographic data, while\ninferential statistics such as correlation and regression analysis were used to establish\nthe relationship between leadership styles and employee performance. Results were\npresented using tables, charts, and graphs for easy interpretation.\n3.8 Ethical considerations\nEthical considerations were critical in ensuring the rights and well-being of\nrespondents were protected. The researcher sought informed consent from all\nrespondents, explaining the purpose of the study and assuring them of confidentiality\nand anonymity. Participation was voluntary, and respondents had the right to\nwithdraw from the study at any time without penalty. The study avoided causing any\nphysical or psychological harm to participants and ensured that findings were\nreported accurately and objectively (Saunders, Lewis, & Thornhill, 2009).\n\nCHAPTER FOUR\nDATA PRESENTATION, ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION OF FINDINGS\n4.0 Introduction\nThis chapter presents, analyzes, and discusses the findings of the study on the impact\nof leadership styles on employee performance at Centenary Bank. Data collected\nfrom respondents was analyzed using frequencies, percentages, means, and standard\ndeviations, with results presented in tables for clarity.\n4.1 Response rate\nThe study targeted a total of 120 respondents from Centenary Bank. Of these, 92 fully\ncompleted and returned the questionnaires, giving a response rate of 92%, which is\nconsidered excellent for analysis and reporting purposes. According to Mugenda &\nMugenda (2009), a response rate above 70% is excellent for reporting and ensures\nreliability of the data collected.\n4.2 Demographic characteristics of the respondents.\nThis section presents the demographic attributes of the respondents, including\ngender, education level, and work experience, as these factors provide context for\ninterpreting the study findings.\nTable 4.1: Gender of the Respondents\nCategory\nMale\n56.5\nFemale\n43.5\nTotal\n100.0", "word_count": 390, "start_char": 37689, "end_char": 40488}

This suggests that both genders were well represented in the study,\nalthough the bank had slightly more male employees participating.\nTable 4.2: Education Level of Respondents\nEducation Level\nDiploma\n21.7\nBachelor’s Degree\n54.3\nMaster’s Degree\n16.3\nProfessional Courses\n7.7\nTotal\n100.0\nThe table presents the distribution of respondents based on their education levels.\nOut of a total sample of 92 respondents, the majority hold a Bachelor’s degree\n(54.3%), followed by Diploma holders (21.7%), Master’s degree holders (16.3%), and a\nsmaller proportion having completed Professional courses (7.7%).\nThe findings indicate that most respondents are fairly well-educated, with over 70%\npossessing at least a bachelor’s degree or higher. This suggests that the study involved\nparticipants with substantial academic backgrounds, which may positively influence\ntheir ability to understand the study\nThe presence of respondents with diplomas and professional courses also adds\ndiversity to the educational profile, ensuring that perspectives from individuals with\ndifferent levels of academic and practical training are represented. This diversity can\nhelp capture a more holistic view of the research topic.\nTable 4.3: Work Experience of Respondents", "word_count": 232, "start_char": 40214, "end_char": 41829}

This distribution indicates that most respondents have a considerable length of\nservice at Centenary Bank, with nearly 89.1% having over one year of experience.\nSuch a workforce is likely to have substantial exposure to the bank’s leadership\npractices, enabling them to provide well-informed insights on how different\nleadership styles influence employee performance.\nEmployees with longer tenure can better assess the effectiveness of leadership\napproaches because they have experienced the bank’s organizational culture and\nperformance expectations over time. Moreover, the presence of newer employees\n(10.9%) offers perspectives on how leadership styles impact staff motivation and\nadaptation during the early stages of employment. Overall, the data suggests that the\nfindings on leadership styles and employee performance are based on a workforce\nwith diverse yet predominantly extensive experience, ensuring reliability and depth in\nthe responses.\n4.3 Descriptive Statistics of the Study Variables\nThe study variables were analyzed using means and standard deviations. The mean\nreflects the general trend of responses, while the standard deviation shows the extent\nof agreement or variation among respondents.
