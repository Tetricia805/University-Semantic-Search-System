Both are complementary to each other.\nSame hardware can be loaded with different software to\nmake a computer perform different types of jobs.\nExcept for upgrades (like increasing main memory and hard\ndisk capacities, or adding speakers, modems, etc.) hardware\nis normally a one time expense, whereas software is a\ncontinuous expense.\n\nTypes of Software\nSystem Software: Is a set of one or more programs designed to\ncontrol the operation and extend the processing capability of a\ncomputer system.\nSystem software performs one or more of the following:\nSupports development of other application software.\nSupports the execution of other application software.\nMonitors the effective use of various hardware resources such\nas the CPU, memory, peripherals, etc.\nCommunicates with and controls operation of peripheral devices\nsuch as printer, disk, tape, etc.\n\n©ISBAT UNIVERSITY –2023.\nTypes of Software continued...\nPrograms included in a system software package are called system programs.

These machines have microprocessor\nchips with embedded software.\n\nMiddleware\nIs a set of tools and data that helps applications use networked resources and\nservices.\nIt is a separate software layer that acts as “glue” between the client and server\nparts of an application and provides a programming abstraction as well as\nmasks the heterogeneity of underlying networks, hardware, and operating\nsystem from application programmers.\nExamples include;\nWeb servers\nApplication servers\nTelecommunication softwares\nTransaction monitors\nMessaging and queueing software\n\nComputer Programming Languages\nA language acceptable to a computer system is called a\nComputer language or programming language, and the\nprocess of off writing instructions in such a language is\ncalled programming or coding.\nThe words and symbols of a computer language must be\nused as per the set rules known as syntax rules.\nComputer programming languages are classified into two;\nLow Level Languages\nHigh Level languages\n\nLow Level Languages (LLL)\nMachine Language: Is the only language the computer understands without\nusing a translation program.\nIs normally written as a string of 1s and 0s but doesn’t necessarily have to\nbe. It can also be written using decimal digits if the computer circuitry\npermits this.\nThe circuitry of a computer is wired in a way that it recognizes the machine\nlanguage instructions immediately, and converts them into electrical signals\nneeded to execute them.", "word_count": 427, "start_char": 2136, "end_char": 5031}
