The\norganization was formed by Mary Sumner. “Englishwoman Mary Sumner founded MU. She\ngrew up in a happy home where her father ensured she was well-educated and Mary was very\ngrateful for that but, as she often said later, the house revolved around her mother. In 1848, then\naged nineteen, Mary married a clergyman by the name of George Sumner. When her first child\nwas born, she felt inadequate for the spiritual and moral responsibility of bringing up the child.\nShe also reasoned that, if she thought that, other mothers must feel that too. Later, when she was\nin her fifties, that conviction prompted her to begin a small, local ministry to meet the need.”1\n“The Society had its beginnings in 1876 in the parish of old Alresford, Hampshire, England,\nwhen Mary Elizabeth Sumner, the Rector’s wife, gathered together the mothers of the parish to\nform a group that would unite in prayer and service, working actively in their own homes for\ngrowth in marriage and the Christian upbringing of their children.”2 History says she panicked\nwhen the moment came to speak of this new idea and her husband, George Sumner, had to take\nover. A week later Mary called another meeting and the Mothers’ Union was born.\n“MU is a worldwide Christian organisation that is over 140 years old, active in 84 countries, and\nhas over 4 million members linked by daily prayer. Most members are from India (1.9 million)\nand Africa (1.3 million). It is a ministry to help families at their point of need.”3 Also Cordelia\nMoyse writes, “The MU is a mass organisation which has its roots deep in local parish life and in\nthe lives of ordinary women.”4 MU soon spread across social, economic, national and ethnic\nboundaries. It helped encourage some women to be less private and more public about their\nChristian faith, for example., praying with other women for their children.\nAnother MU ministry, begun by Joyce Hayman in Sydney, serving tea and biscuits to families\nand defendants in the law courts. This ministry began as a three-day-a-week concession by the\nJustice Department, but soon expanded to five days as Magistrates noticed the calming effect", "word_count": 439, "start_char": 12586, "end_char": 15230}

In July 1973, The Sun Herald reported, “It took a\nquiet homemaker to go and look at the place with the intention of trying to improve the\nsituation.” MU members who heard about the ministry in England were soon at work to replicate\nthe ministry in their own country.\nIn the Diocese of Lweru, Mothers’ Union has been in existence since 2006. The Diocese of\nLweru was formed from the Mother Diocese of Kagera. According to the interview from\nMargreth Kyabona “The Diocese of Lweru has 154 members of Mothers’ Union.”5 This\norganization has a Vision, Mission, Core Values and Goals to be achieved within a stipulated\nperiod of time. The main mission is the advancement of Christianity in all spheres of marriage\nand family life. In order to carry out this mission, Mothers’ Union’s objectives are: first to keep a\ncommunity of Christians connected in prayer, worship, and service on a global scale; to inspire\nparents to raise their children in the Church's faith and way of life; to defend and advance the\nlarger understanding of Christ's teaching on the nature of marriage; to encourage social factors\nthat are conducive to stable family life and the protection of children; and lastly to support\npeople whose family lives, have experienced difficulties.\n1.2 Statement of the Problem\nAlthough Mothers’ Union members in the Diocese of Lweru play a critical role in the church but\ntheir involvement in caring the children in the church is generally poor and this has contributed\ngreatly to ineffective children’s ministry generally in the Diocese. Although Jesus Christ himself\ndeclared in the Gospel according to Mathew 19:14, “let the little children come to me and do not\nhinder them for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as thesem,” many of the MU members in\nLweru Diocese have not yet responded well to this divine calling. Jesus is ready to receive the\nchildren into his kingdom but some parents including many mothers are hindering the children\nfrom coming to Jesus Christ in many ways, especially by not allowing them to go to church on\nSundays. They leave them behind to keep their homes or they give the children different kinds of\nwork like cooking and caring for their siblings as their mothers go to the church for Sunday\nworship and discipleship programmes.\n\n5Margret Kyabona, Diocesan secretary of Mother’s Union.

According to the Mothers' Union's Constitution, the organization's main\ngoal is to provide Christian women with knowledge about how to lead Christian families, and its\nsecondary goal is to assist in the Union's economic development so that it can carry out its\nactivities. This secondary goal is beneficial, but it should not take priority over the primary one.\nMany Mothers’ Union members have expressed their dissatisfaction with the Mothers' Union's\ncurrent fundraising efforts across the Diocese, claiming that Christian women are becoming\nincreasingly weary of the organization's excessive requests for monetary and material support.\nDespite being duly elected, several Mothers' Union leaders have been accused of failing to grasp\ntheir responsibilities. Many believe that these leaders never had any official education or training\nregarding their duties and responsibilities. These leaders have not done much to promote\nChristian family life. Since the Kasindaga Deanery represented the Diocese of Lweru, the\nresearcher used this background information to investigate the Mothers' Union's role in children's\nministry.\n1.3 Purpose of the Study\nThe main purpose of this study was to find out the role of Mothers’ Union in the Children’s\nministry, especially in Kasindaga Deanery, Diocese of Lweru, Tanzania.\n1.4 Specific Objectives of the Study\ni.\nTo examine how Mothers’ Union members engage in the children's ministry activities in\nKasindaga Deanery, Diocese of Lweru.\nii.\nTo examine the reasons why sometimes Mothers’ Union members, fail to fulfill their\nroles in the children’s ministry in Kasindaga Deanery, Diocese of Lweru.\niii.\nTo establish the suggestions to ensure that the Mothers’ Union objective of effective\nchildren’s ministry is achieved in Kasindaga Deanery, Diocese of Lweru.\n1.5 Research Questions\nHow do the Mothers’ Union members of Kasindaga Deanery, Diocese of Lweru participate in\nthe children’s ministry activities in Kasindaga Deanery, Diocese of Lweru?\nWhat are the reasons why sometimes Mothers’ Union members fail to fulfill their roles in the\nchildren’s ministry in Kasindaga Deanery, Diocese of Lweru?", "word_count": 384, "start_char": 17652, "end_char": 20207}

Lweru Diocese is one of the\nAnglican dioceses found in the North Western part of Tanzania, Kagera region, Muleba district.\nLweru Diocese is the 23rd Anglican Diocese in the Church of the Province of Tanzania. It was\nestablished on 20 August 2006. “It borders Uganda in the north and Lake Victoria in the east. It\nlies between longitudes 1° and 2.5° S and latitudes 31° and 33° E. The Diocese has 21 islands of\nwhich 15 are inhabitable. The land is well-watered, ever-green and beautiful; with a comfortable\ntemperature range of 17° C – 29° C. The average rainfall is between 800 – 1,500 mm per year.\nThe name Lweru is an indigenous name for Lake Victoria. It means an expansive mass of water\nspread out over a very large area. The name upholds the eminence and immaculacy of the\nworld’s third largest lake.”6\n1.6.2 Content Scope\nThe study was an assessment of the role of Mothers’ Union in the children’s ministry in\nKasindaga Deanery, Lweru Diocese, Anglican Church of Tanzania. It was limited to examining\nwhat the diocese of Lweru in the Anglican Church of Tanzania is doing and not doing in relation\nthe role of Mothers’ Union members’ involvement in the children’s ministry.\n1.6.3 Time Scope\nTime scope is the presentation of a chronological sequence of events along a drawn line that\nenables a viewer to understand temporal relationships quickly. This study covered the period of\n2015 to 2023. This is because it was the period when this problem was taken seriously in the\ndiocese and especially in Kasindaga Deanery.\n\n6https://ardfa.org.au/tanzania-lweru-church-roofs/posts/roofless", "word_count": 331, "start_char": 20056, "end_char": 22073}

The literature was reviewed under the three sub topics\nfollowing the three of objectives of the study which are: to examine how Mothers' Union engage\nin the children's ministry activities in Kasindaga Deanery; to examine the reasons why\nsometimes Mothers’ Union members fail to fulfill their roles in the children’s ministry in\nKasindaga Deanery; and to come up with suggestions to ensure that the Mothers’ Union\nobjective of effective children’s ministry is achieved in Kasindaga Deanery, Diocese of Lweru.\n2.2 Mothers’ Union Involvement in Children’s Ministry Activities\nThe role of Mothers' Union is to bring God's love to others through local activities like\nsupporting children in their own church, or projects and campaigns that everyone can join in, to\nraise awareness of gender-based violence. “As Mothers’ Union members we work as a team,\ninspiring each other during fellowship. We discuss issues of our children, spouses, and look for\nalternative ways of how to handle family and social problems”7\nMU’s specific objectives include: “To encourage parents in their role of developing the faith of\ntheir children. Maintaining a worldwide fellowship of Christians united in prayer, worship and\nservice; promoting conditions in society favorable for stable family life and the protection of\nchildren; helping those whose family life has met with adversity; and promoting and supporting\nmarried life.”8\nThe lessons learned can be applied to inspire and lead others when children return to their\ncommunities of faith and society at large. “Christian parents play an extremely important role in\nhelping to nature the children. It is merely to help the next generation know the Bible so that they\ncan use it as a source of proof texts. It is to impress the word of God on our hearts, on the hearts\n\n7 Worship Book. (1995).

This corresponds to their mandate of assisting those families met with\nadversity. In addition, they engage in charity work and social activities to promote conditions in\nsociety favorable for stable family life and protection of the vulnerable children.\n2.3 How the Church has Supported Mothers’ Union Members’ Involvement in Children’s\nMinistry Activities\nThe Church’s role in underpinning and supporting parents is vital. The church must support\nparents and families so that they in turn are better and able to support the Children. God himself\nentrusted his Son to humankind as a vulnerable child, requiring that Son to be natured by a frail\nbut able family and community, symbolically providing a model of trust and responsibility (Luk\n2:41-45).\n“The Church, is a physical structure where people gather to worship, learn and to have\nfellowship with others who believe in Jesus Christ.”10In another sense, a church, according the\nabove authors, could be a spiritual community of all people who believe in Jesus Christ. In its\nprimary sense it means a visible, local congregation, or an organized company of disciples\nmeeting at a given place and for a given purpose. Therefore, a Church is a congregation of\nbaptized believers united by covenant to carry into effect the will of the Lord Jesus Christ. The\nchurch has a mandate, among other things, to ensure the total development of their members\nincluding the children. “The church, as an agent of child development plays a vital role, in\nconjunction with other stakeholders, not only in the spiritual and moral aspects of the child’s\ndevelopment, but also see to the social, educational and psychological status of the child through\nits (the church’s) peripheral functions. Therefore, an effective faith-based children's ministry\n\n9John Brunt. (1982). The bible's role in Christian ethics. by Andrews University Press. Washington. Pg 5\n1010John Archibald. (2020).

How can we forget all His benefits we receive (Psalm\n103:2). We must therefore give Him all the praise, adoration, worship and thanksgiving.\nHallelujah! Every child born into any family is designed from God in heaven for a purpose. The\nparents, the church, the godly teachers and even the child need to play their roles well for this\npurpose of God to be fulfilled. One of the reasons why God established the home is for the\nmaking of generational godly children. He purposely created the first parents, Adam and Eve, on\nearth, in His own image and likeness (Gen.1:26-28), so that they could produce children who\nwould have the fear of God in every generation of the human race.\nIn the Diocese of Lweru, the church has supported Mothers’ Union members in Kasindaga\nDeanery by raising the children as a deliberate act of bringing up, teaching, disciplining of the\nyounger generation to meet a certain standard of behavior within the given social environment.\nThis includes certain rules and regulations to mound the lives of the younger generation to fit\ninto desired future expectations.\nThe church is a place of worship for all the redeemed of the Lord. The church, through her\nagencies, planned to meet the children’s needs by teaching them moral and spiritual values. Also,\nthe church planned to build a children’s center where all the children of Kasindaga Deanery’s\nChristians and non-Christians can meet together on Saturdays to learn the word of God and other\ntalents like, cooking, music, and singing. The church is expected to nurture her members,\nchildren inclusive, into spiritual maturity – Eph. 4:11-14. Biblical doctrines are to be taught to\navoid heresy 2 Tim 3:1-3.\nThe ambience of the church must be made conducive enough to raise these future heroes, the\nprogrammers of the church must be systematically planned to meet the needs of the children and\nequip them. “Organizing programmers’ relevant to their age and assign them to participate.

These were revealed by the empirical findings of this study that are recorded in\nChapter Four of this dissertation.\n2.5 How the Church can ensure that the Mothers’ Union Members do not fail in their role\nof effective Children’s Ministry\nTo surmount these barriers, we need to engage in formal, informal and non-formal ministry\ntraining, adopt more relational approaches, and strengthen intergenerational connections.\nMothers’ Union members should also prioritize family ministry, including children and parents\nin the process and practice of ministry, and cultivating mindsets that are open to how things\ncould be.\nConcerning volunteers, as one practitioner suggested, we need to get better at identifying\npeople’s gifts, and not just getting people to fill gaps. Catherine Booth, the co-founder of the\nSalvation Army, said, “There is no improving the future without disturbing the present.”13\nSometimes, the greatest hindrance to a strategic approach to children’s ministry is the barriers we\nerect in our minds. Are you welded to what you know? Most religious people tend to love the\npast more than the present or the future (the irony is that God is always “making everything\nnew”14 Revelation 21:5). We must embrace change. Holding onto the past does not give\nchildren’s ministry much of a future.\nYes, change is risky, but not changing is even riskier! If we do not change, we sentence\nchildren’s ministry to stagnation or decline. To surmount these barriers, we need to ramp up\nformal, informal and non-formal ministry training, adopt more relational approaches, and\nstrengthen intergenerational connections.\n\n12Joyce Maneno Beja.

Children and the students are part of the church now,\nand we will lose them if we do not minister well to them today.\nEstablish prayer partners with children. Imagine what might happen if assigned people in your\nchurch prayed weekly for every child in your ministry. Connect the generations by establishing\nan intentional plan to do so. “Gifted communicators will creatively teach Bible lessons in a way\nthat intrigues and engages children of all ages. A child will hang on every word of stories, then\ntalk about how to apply a biblical truth to their everyday lives. The learning experience will\ninclude drama, video, storyboards, fun activities, music children think is cool, and other creative\ncomponents to help the Bible make sense. For example, when a child walks into the Best Hour,\nthey see decorations that are colorful, interesting, and bright. It is a place they know right away is\njust for them and where they belong—even if they have never been to church before. A place\nthey want to invite their friends to. Yet no matter how many friends they have or do not have, it\nis a place where they will feel accepted and welcomed.”15\nDevelop a church membership and begin discipleship classes for the children. When children\nchoose to follow Christ, the biblical demands on their lives are not different than adults. Help\nthem get started well as new believers.\nHang out with the children, walk through their areas every Sunday, talk to them, get to know\ntheir names, listen to them and their stories, and love them.\nTraining. Willingness to serve does not automatically equal ability to serve. The Mothers’ Union\nmembers must get training on how to lead children.\nCapitalize on media resources.

This was attributed to the fact that\nwomen tend to take leadership roles in the Church more than men.\nTable 1 also reveals that majority of the respondents (86%) are married and 14% are single. This\nimplies that most of the respondents are married. This means that the married Christians are easy\nto access than the unmarried Christians because most of the time they are always at home\nlooking after their children.\nI also show that majority of the respondents(68%) attained primary education, 14% attained\ncollege education, 12% attained secondary education while only 6% attained University\neducation.

Also, the church prepares seminars that have been conducted by the church at\ndifference times. Through its preaching, teaching and seminars the church encourages all\nChristians not to copy and adopt foreign traditions and culture that are harmful to our nation.\n\nThe first objective of the study was to examine how the Mothers’ Union members engage in the\nchildren's ministry activities in Kasindaga Deanery, Diocese of Lweru. The respondents were\nrequested to respond to a question regarding how the Mothers’ Union members engage in the\nchildren's ministry activities in Kasindaga Deanery, Diocese of Lweru (question 1 of this study’s\nquestionnaire).

This implies that the Church prays for the\nchildren through Mothers’ Union. The role of Mothers' Union is to bring God's love to others\nthrough local activities like supporting children in their own church, or projects and campaigns\nthat everyone can join in, to raise awareness of gender-based violence. To support the above\nfindings, one of the respondents interviewed said that;\n“As Mothers’ union members, we work as a team, inspiring each other during fellowship.\nWe discuss issues concerning our children and spouses, and look for alternative ways of\nhandling family and social problems.”\n4.3 Reasons why sometimes Mothers’ Union Members fail to fulfill their roles in the\nChildren’s Ministry in Kasindaga Deanery, Diocese of Lweru\nFindings indicated that 46% of the respondents said that Mothers’ Union members sometimes\nfail to fulfill their roles in the children’s ministry due to the drought which causes a shortage of\nfood.

The\nresponses are summarized in Table 4.3 below.\nPoverty among many members of the Mothers’ Union is another cause of failure to fulfill their\nrole in the children’s ministry. They use the day time to work for the needs for their families but\non the other hand they fear the many financial contributions to the Union which are continuous.\nConflict in some families and among some communities: These conflicts bring discord and, in\nthe end, the work fails because of that. This is why some mothers are unable to work realistically\nand serve with great difficulty because of family conflicts.\nAlso, lack of unity is an obstacle to the development of the unity of the mothers. This is caused\nby some mothers having a high income and looking down on those with low income, or others\nbeing educated and others uneducated. This causes mothers to lack unity and solidarity.\nTable 3: Reasons why sometimes Mothers’ Union Members fail to fulfill their roles in the\nChildren’s Ministry in Kasindaga Deanery, Diocese of Lweru\nReason\nDrought which causes a shortage of food (poverty)\nLack of unity\nFamily conflicts\nTotal\nFindings from table 4.3 indicate that majority of the respondents 46% said that Mothers’ Union\nmembers sometimes fail to fulfill their roles in the children’s ministry due to the drought which", "word_count": 359, "start_char": 44520, "end_char": 46700}

According to Mark 10:13-16, people were bringing little children to Jesus for\nhim to touch them but the disciples rebuked them. This is a problem of some of the parents in\nmany areas in Lweru Diocese because they have such behavior. Jesus is indignant and this is the\nonly passage in the Gospel narratives where the holy anger of Jesus is so sharply aroused.\nIn relation to this section some of the participants interviewed said that:\n“I recommend the unity of mothers to stay close to the children and give them education\non building their mental, physical and social capacity because many children fail to\ncomplete their education by being lured into businesses and sent to the cities to do\ndomestic work as a part of the family's economy, thus leading to failure to achieve the\nMU goals and sometimes they get HIV/AIDS infection and lose their lives.”\n“Children should be protected against the bad values that are emerging now, gender\ndiscrimination should be strongly opposed, children should also be given safety and\nprotection, especially stop sending them to the bus stand at night.”", "word_count": 351, "start_char": 48395, "end_char": 50543}
{"chunk_id": "DOC0040__00022", "doc_id": "DOC0040", "chunk_index": 22, "text": "CHAPTER FIVE: THEOLOGICAL ANALYSIS\n5.1 Introduction\nThis chapter presents the theological analysis of the role of Mothers’ Union in the Children’s\nministry in relation to the Bible, both the Old Testament and New Testament throughout the\nHistory of the Church up to the modern Church. This analysis is done on the basis and context of\nthe first three chapters of this study. The main aim is to come up with a wider picture about the\nreal role of Mothers’ Union in the children’s ministry.\n5.2 The Role of Mothers’ Union in the Children’s ministry in relation to the Old Testament\nBiblical examples can be used to illustrate the variety of responsibilities that Christian mothers\nhave. According to Genesis 3:16, God created Eve (women) expressly for the purpose of\nphysically becoming pregnant and giving birth. He also gave women an emotional disposition\nthat makes it easier for them to bond with and care for their offspring. Paul references the fifth\ncommandment, which is for children to reverence their parents, in Exodus 20:12 in verse 20. In\nverse 21, fathers are admonished to control their rage and any other hostile feelings they may\nhave towards their children. Deuteronomy 4:9; Deuteronomy 6:7-9; Deuteronomy 11:18-19 and\nPsalm 71:18 elaborate the concept of rearing and teaching children along with the scriptural\nmandates of the Bible. Therefore, it indicates that the parents are the ones with the primary\nresponsibility of rearing children, while the society and the church come the second. Hence, the\nresponsibility lies with the parents in fulfilling their biblical responsibilities. This relates very\nclosely with the role of the Mothers’ Union Organization in their responsibility to model\nChristian families according to their objectives.\nMany parents leave their children at home and do not give them priority to worship in church as\nthe results children fail to have time of gathering in the church to worship and share the word of\nGod together as we see in the book of proverb 22:6 “train a child in the way he should go and\nwhen he is old e will not turn from it” this means this verse explains how to raise a child in\nmorals and in Christian life. Furthermore, Mothers’ Union members should encourage parents to\nbring up their children in the faith and life of the Church of Christ by teaching them at home.\nIts recognizing that children are frequently exploited the fatherless child is snatched from the\nbreast; and the infant of the poor is seized for a debt (Job 24:9). Job here points to a particularly", "word_count": 425, "start_char": 50543, "end_char": 53076}

Here it is\nknowing that children can be victims of hunger and nakedness lacking clothes, they go about\nnaked, they carry the sheaves but still go hungry (Job 24:10). It is believed that children are\nsometimes face some challenges of abused in different position and this happening because of\nfailing to care children in good moral as we see in the book of Joel is trying to show how\nchildren pass through in their life because of lack of good care they cast lots for my people and\ntraded boys for prostitutes they sold girls for wine to drink (Joel 3:3).\nIn Psalm 127:3, the Bible confirms that “children are a heritage from the Lord, the fruit of the\nwomb is its reward.” Their arrival brings joy, jubilations and celebrations as they are ushered in\nto be part and parcel of the larger community. This implies that children are a blessing to behold\nfor parents as well as the larger community. The role of Christian mothers is multifaceted as can\nbe depicted from biblical examples.\nHannah the mother of Samuel stands out as an outstanding example: Before she conceived, she\npromised to dedicate her son Samuel to God (1 Samuel 1:11). The number one role of a mother\nis to put God first and seek to dedicate their lives to God and to seek His blessings in everything\nthey intend to do. Godly and devoted mothers should mirror their perspective like Hannah, they\nshould teach their children to be committed and obedient to God and live to serve Him in all their\nways.\n5.3 The role of Mothers’ Union in the Children’s ministry in relation to the New Testament\nThis section deals with Biblical passages related to the role of Mothers’ Union in children’s\nministry as found in the New Testament. Relevant lessons are drawn from such passages for the\ndiscussion of the issues raised in Chapter four.\nThe Apostle Paul tells us in 1Cor 15:58 that all Christians (not just clergy or elders) are to be\ninvolved in the work of the Lord. We also see in Romans 12, 1Cor 12, 1 Peter 4 and Eph 4 that\nall Christians have been gifted to serve the Church. God’s Spirit has equipped all Christians to\nbuild the church and reach the lost. We exercise these gifts in our homes and other family and\nfriendship groups. But of course, we also exercise these gifts in our local churches and\nparachurch ministries like Mothers’ Union.

Mothers should teach the young women how to develop motherhood qualities and\nhow to lead Christian lives. The main responsibility of the young women is to help their\nhusbands to raise their children in a godly way.\nPaul provides guidelines for the various members of the home who live a Christian life in\nColossians 3:18–25 and Colossians 4:1. Paul addresses fathers, mothers, slaves, and children as\nmembers of the household. Paul provides guidelines for each family member so that everyone\nmight live a Christian life. Paul warns that if dads provoke their kids, the children would lose\nhope in being liked by both their parents and God.\nIn Luke 1:27-3 and 2 Timothy 1:5, children learn through observation and imitation of what their\nforebears say and do. Additionally, children learn through positive or negative reinforcement.\nFor the Christian mothers to train their children spiritually in a sustainable manner, the mothers\nthemselves must be spiritually mature and sincere in their faith.\nChildren must be raised to understand that God is love, holiness, justice, and that he expects\nsubmission from his followers. Rebellion and disobedience toward God result in eternal\ndamnation. Children must be made aware of the fact that Jesus died on the cross in place of us\n(Galatians 3:13). Additionally, they must understand that God pardons sins out of kindness and\npity (1 John 2:2). They need to be aware that everyone is answerable to God (2 Corinthians 5:10;\nRomans14:12) as they raise their children in God's word.\n5.5 The Role of Mothers’ Union in the Contemporary Church\nMothers' Union works by creating safe spaces and listening, breaking down barriers between and\nwithin people. Members often make use of participatory exercises, including Bible study, to\nsurface sensitive issues and challenge harmful norms. Active listening is encouraged and plans\nare forged together.\nMothers' Union equips members and their communities to recognize and use the skills, resources\nand talents around them. Through this process, people are able to take ownership of their own\nfuture, lifting them from dependency.", "word_count": 404, "start_char": 55297, "end_char": 57844}

Christian Mothers must train their children on how to live\naccording to the word of God that separates right from wrong in relation to the greatest\ncommandment (Mark 12: 30-31) that requires Christians to love God and well as man. Children\nneed to see their mothers applying this commandment while teaching them to apply it in their\nown lives.\n\nCHAPTER SIX: CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n6.1 Introduction\nThis chapter presents the conclusion based on the findings and recommendations based on both\nthe study findings and other relevant literature considered necessary and vital to be used in future\nto improve the study situation.\n6.2 Conclusion\nThis study has revealed that a lot more needs to be done by different stakeholders to ensure that\nthe Mothers’ Union objective of effective children’s ministry is achieved.\n6.4 Recommendations\nMothers’ Union members need to get training on how to lead children in a Godly way. This is\nbecause they are the foundation of the church and are very dependable in the church and the\nfamily.\nThe Mothers’ Union members have mandate to teach children and mobilize themselves to know\nthe value of children in the church. Therefore, the researcher recommends that Mothers’ Union\nin Kasindaga Deanery, Diocese of Lweru need to develop a church membership and begin\ndiscipleship classes for children.\nNot only that but also, there should be a mass sensitization about the importance of effective\nchildren’s ministry in Kasindaga Deanery, Diocese of Lweru so that the members of Mothers’\nUnion and other congregants can join hands to expand and improve the children’s ministry.\nThere is need to encourage parents to bring up their children in the Christian faith and life of\nchurch, and especially in kasindaga denary Lweru diocese.\nThe Denery should promote conditions in society that are favorable for stable communities and\nthe protection of children (Isaiah 49:15-16) “Can a mother forget the baby ate breast and have no\ncompassion on the child she has born? Though she may forget, I will not forget you.” Here Lord\nassures the people that he will never forget them because they are inscribed on the palms of His\nhands.", "word_count": 440, "start_char": 57555, "end_char": 60303}

And\nconcerning volunteers, as one practitioner suggested. We need to get better at identifying\npeople’s gifts, and not just getting people to fill gaps.", "word_count": 82, "start_char": 60144, "end_char": 60633}
