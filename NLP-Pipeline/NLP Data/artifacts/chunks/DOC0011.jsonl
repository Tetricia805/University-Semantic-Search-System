This problem has led to\nthe division in spiritual beliefs. Social norms and institutions.\nThis research topic aims to explore many different aspects that church leaders play in\naddressing domestic violence within their congregation.\nThis study seeks to identify both the challenges and opportunities in creating a safe and\nsupporting evil for the victims of domestic violence and with findings will contribute to\na better understanding of how religious institutions can effectively address this issue,\npromoting the wellbeing and safety of all members with church community.\n\nCHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION\n1.0 Background of the study\nDomestic violence remains a widespread problem in Uganda and has become a major\nbarrier to achieving national development goals, including those outlined in the\nMillennium Declaration and the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Domestic\nviolence occurs when someone in a close relationship—such as a husband, wife, parent,\nor partner—hurts, controls, or mistreats the other person. This mistreatment can be\nphysical, emotional, sexual, spiritual, or financial. It is a sin against God’s command to\nlove one another (John 13:34) and to treat each other with kindness, respect, and\ndignity (Ephesians 4:32).\nChristians believe that every person is created in the image of God (Genesis 1:27) and\ndeserves to live in peace, safety, and love. Domestic violence breaks the trust and love\nthat God intended for families and marriages. It goes beyond physical harm and includes\nharsh words, threats, neglect, forced sexual acts, and even preventing someone from\nattending church or working.\nDomestic violence is not God’s will. The church must be a safe haven for victims and\nspeak out against all forms of abuse. God calls His people to protect the vulnerable\n(Psalm 82:3-4), speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves (Proverbs 31:8),\nand bring healing and justice to the suffering.\nThe church is called to serve and equip its ministers and members to care for families.\nThis mission is outlined in Matthew 28:18-20, where Jesus commands His followers to", "word_count": 359, "start_char": 10252, "end_char": 12568}

This includes ministering to and supporting victims\nin a broken and, at times, violent society. Many churches and clergy may mistakenly\nbelieve domestic violence is not a major issue within the church. However, it is a serious\nand widespread problem that crosses racial, ethnic, and social boundaries and affects\neven conservative Christian communities (Nelson-Clark, 2012).\nIn Uganda, statistics show that among married, divorced, or separated women, about\none in four has experienced emotional violence by their current or former husband.\nAdditionally, 40% have experienced physical violence, and 16% have experienced sexual\nviolence (CBS & MOH, 2006). Marriage is intended to be a life-long covenant, but due\nto humanity living in a fallen world, issues like divorce and domestic violence arise. The\nBible acknowledges that brokenness and abuse in the home must be addressed.\nDomestic violence cuts across all socio-economic levels, cultures, and religions.\nDomestic violence refers to intentional acts of harm imposed by one partner on another,\ntypically through coercion, manipulation, humiliation, or force to gain control over the\nother. Some families experience a cycle of violence that can last for years, with some\ncases even ending in fatalities. If violence is not recognized and addressed, it escalates.\nAlarmingly, deaths resulting from domestic violence are becoming increasingly\ncommon.\nViolence against women is often seen as a private matter, but women from all walks of\nlife experience it—rich or poor, educated or illiterate, high-ranking or low-income.\nViolence affects women of all ages and should no longer be hidden behind closed doors\nfor the sake of family pride or stability.

Women often\nfeel shame and fear, causing them to hide the violence or accept it as part of life. Some\nwomen also perpetrate violence, highlighting the need for a broader understanding and\nresponse.\nThe church has a role to play in addressing the moral decay in society. It must also\nrecognize that people with different values are entering the church, and church\nleadership must respond appropriately. Although Scripture clearly instructs husbands to\nlove their wives, many victims do not feel comfortable reporting abuse to clergy. The\nchurch’s patriarchal nature has, in some cases, led to the misuse of biblical teachings\nto justify violence. For example, Ephesians 5 on submission has been misinterpreted to\nencourage women to remain submissive even in abusive relationships, without proper\ninterpretation and context (Mollenkott, 2003:40).\nChurch leaders, guided by Scripture such as Jesus' references to Deuteronomy in\ndiscussions about marriage, should proactively support families in crisis. Pastors should\nnot wait until a marriage is in crisis to offer biblical counsel. Providing biblical teachings\non marriage and divorce in a non-crisis setting helps couples reflect and pray about\ntheir relationship with God's guidance. Pastoral counseling should aim not to dictate\nbut to guide, leaving room for God to speak through His Word.\nResearch shows that clergy are often the first people approached for help with domestic\nviolence issues (Rotunda et al., 2004:357).

Often, clergy struggle with the tension between preserving marriage and\nprotecting victims. Unfortunately, many lack the training necessary to support victims\neffectively (Levitt & Ware, 2006:237).\nDespite the church’s teachings promoting peace and harmony, reality often tells a\ndifferent story. This contradiction highlights the urgent need for studies like this one.\nIt seeks to draw attention to the issue and encourage church leaders to reflect, respond,\nand help bring healing to families in crisis.\n1.1 Statement of the Problem\nUganda is mostly a Christian country, so people expect the Church to help stop domestic\nviolence and build peaceful families. But in Kitojo Parish, Nyabiteete Archdeaconry, this\nis not happening. Even though church leaders try to help through preaching, counseling,\nand marriage programs, many church marriages still break up within five years\n(Tumwebaze, 2020). This shows that the Church's efforts may not be working well.\nA report from Georgia (2009) says that many survivors of domestic violence feel alone\nand afraid to speak up.

Because of this, many families\nstill suffer. This study wants to find out how church leaders respond to domestic\nviolence and why some methods may not be working (Jendia, 2015).\n1.2 The purpose of the study\nTo investigate the role of the church leadership in responding to domestic violence\namong their followers in Kitojo Parish Nyabiteete Archdeaconry.\n1.3 Specific Objectives\na) To examine the Church leaders understanding of domestic violence in Kitojo\nParish Nyabiteete Archdeaconry.\nb) To determine the framework that informs the church response to domestic\nviolence in Kitojo Parish Nyabiteete Archdeaconry.\nc) To examine the effectiveness of the church leaders in addressing domestic\nviolence in Kitojo Parish Nyabiteete Archdeaconry.\n1.4 Research Questions\na) What are the church leaders understanding of domestic violence in Kitojo Parish\nNyabiteete Archdeaconry?\n\nb) What Frameworks the church leaders in Kitojo Parish Nyabiteete Archdeaconry\nuse in their response to domestic violence?\nc) How effective is the church in addressing domestic violence in Kitojo Parish\nNyabiteete Archdeaconry?\n1.5 Hypotheses and Assumptions of the Study\nThe study had the following hypotheses.\nH1.

It would also highlight key areas where clergy need further\ntraining, supporting Bible colleges and theological institutions in strengthening their\ncounseling and pastoral care curricula.\nUltimately, the study would identify specific training needs for Anglican church leaders,\nequipping them to play a more active and informed role in preventing and responding\nto domestic violence within their communities.\n1.7 Content, Geographical and Time scope of the Study\nContent Scope:\nThis study focused on the role of church leaders in addressing domestic violence, which\nis one specific form of gender-based violence. It should aim to understand how church\nleaders could respond to cases of domestic violence reported within their\ncongregations. The study would be limited to examining pastoral care, counseling, and\nother church-based interventions, and were not include other forms of gender-based\nviolence or responses from other religious groups.\n\nGeographical Scope\nThe study was conducted in Kitojo Parish, Nyabiteete Archdeaconry, located in\nRukungiri District, Uganda. This area included several sub-parishes where church\nleaders were residing within church premises and were responsible for spiritual\nleadership and pastoral care. The research focused only on the Anglican Church context\nwithin this specific geographical area.\nTime Scope\nThe study covered a period of 10 to 15 years. This timeframe was selected because\ndomestic violence would have become more recognized during this period within the\nAnglican Church, and efforts to address it would have gained attention. The study\nallowed for analysis of how church leaders will have responded to these issues over\ntime.\n1.8 Definition of Terms\nViolence has been defined as the utilization of coercive means of power, utilization of\nforce or threats of its utilization to force an individual into doing something that the\nindividual may otherwise not do.\nViolence Against women means any act of violence that causes, or has the likelihood of\ncausing, physical, sexual or psychological suffering or harm to women, either through\nthreats to do the same, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether at home\nor public life.", "word_count": 406, "start_char": 19777, "end_char": 22532}

In addition to evaluating the material on how the church and clergy\nrespond to violence outside of Africa, it examines conceptual definitions of domestic\nviolence. It also contains works that analyze the biblical foundations that guide\nChristian communities' responses to domestic abuse.\n2.1 Literature Review\n2.1.1 The Church leaders understanding of domestic violence in Kitojo Parish\nNyabiteete Archdeaconry.\nAccording to the United Nations' 1993 Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against\nWomen, domestic violence includes physical, sexual, and psychological abuse of women\nin the home, such as battering; sexual abuse of female children; violence related to\ndowries; marital rape; female genital mutilation; and other harmful customs against\nwomen. It also covers violence related to exploitation and non-spousal violence.\ncategory (UN, 1993). Negative actions in a family or close relationship are referred to\nas domestic abuse. It encompasses dominating actions, mental and physical abuse, and\nsexual coercion. It is defined by the UN (1993) as when a family member or intimate\npartner commits acts of physical, sexual, or psychological violence.\nIn the context of Kitojo Parish, domestic violence manifests in various forms:\n\n\nPhysical Abuse: This includes hitting, slapping, or any form of physical harm.\n\nEmotional Abuse: Involves verbal insults, threats, and isolation from friends and\nfamily.\n\nSexual Abuse: Forcing a partner into sexual activities without consent\n\nEconomic Abuse: Controlling a partner's access to financial resources\nChurch leaders in Kitojo Parish recognize these forms and understand that domestic\nviolence is not limited to physical harm but encompasses a range of abusive behaviors\nthat undermine the dignity and well-being of individuals.\nChurch leaders in Kitojo Parish, Nyabiteete Archdeaconry generally agree with this\ndefinition, as the cases they handle often reflect these various forms of abuse.\nAccording to Shannon-Lewy & Dull (2005:357), domestic violence is a pervasive problem\nthat cuts across social class, gender, race, and religion. In order to obtain power and\ncontrol over an intimate partner, it is commonly defined as a pattern of coercive\nbehaviors, such as physical, sexual, and psychological abuse, as well as verbal and\nemotional threats and intimidation. Although domestic violence can affect men, women\nare more likely to sustain serious and sometimes fatal physical harm (Rosen et al.,\n2003:182; Stith & Rosen, 2004:415). Social and cultural norms that uphold gender\ninequality and frequently support or encourage discrimination against women, including\nmale reprimands, are ingrained in domestic violence. (Ileise et al., 1994:43). It\nexemplifies the unequal power relationships between women and men (Canadian Panel\non Violence Against Women, 1993:4).

These actions are\nrecognized by many as examples of physical abuse and control. Pence and Paymar\n(1993:135) assert that batterers may also demand sex from their partners after an\nabusive incident. For many women, this sex is further degrading, solidifying the\nabuser’s power. Sexual abuse includes a range of acts that are often manifested as rape\nor sexual assault in an abusive relationship. This understanding is relevant to the\nsituation in Kitojo Parish, Nyabiteete Archdeaconry, where church leaders frequently\nencounter these types of abuse within their congregations.\nChurch leaders play a pivotal role in addressing domestic violence. They are often the\nfirst point of contact for victims seeking help. In Kitojo Parish, leaders provide\ncounseling, spiritual guidance, and, when necessary, refer victims to appropriate\nsupport services.\nHowever, challenges exist. Some leaders may lack training in handling such sensitive\nissues, leading to inadequate support for victims.

Collaborations with social workers and human rights\norganizations can also bolster their capacity to support victims effectively.\nAccording to Londt (2004:64), some abusers use sexual violence as a primary method of\nintimidation and harm, which may include pressured, coerced, or physically forced sex.\nVictims may also be forced into sexual activities they find humiliating, painful, or\nunnatural.\nPsychological and emotional abuse is another prominent aspect of domestic violence.\nPaymar (2000:83) describes emotional abuse within the context of battering as a\npowerful psychological weapon designed to cause pain, depersonalize the victim, and\nincrease the batterer's power. Ganley (1996:20) views emotional abuse as a tactic of\ncontrol, comprising a variety of verbal attacks aimed at degrading the victim’s worth\nin their roles as an individual, parent, family member, friend, or community worker.\nThe Bible promotes love, respect, and peace within families. Scriptures such as\nEphesians 5:25 urge husbands to love their wives as Christ loved the church,\nemphasizing selflessness and care. Similarly, Colossians 3:19 advises husbands not to be\nharsh with their wives.\nHowever, misinterpretations of certain passages have been used to justify abusive\nbehaviors.

This patriarchal structure often discourages women from reporting abuse,\nfearing stigma or family dishonor.\nPractices such as bride price can also contribute to the problem. Once a bride price is\npaid, women may be perceived as property, limiting their autonomy and increasing their\nvulnerability to abuse. To address these issues, community education is vital. Church\nleaders can collaborate with cultural leaders to challenge harmful traditions and\npromote values that uphold the dignity and rights of all individuals.\n2.1.2 Biblical stand and teaching on domestic violence.\nThe role of religious teachings and church leaders has been both helpful and\nproblematic in efforts to address domestic violence. A report by the National Catholic\nReporter in 1996 revealed that when social services in Santa Clara County, California\nsurveyed domestic violence victims, many stated they first turned to the church for\nhelp. However, when asked where support was lacking, their answer was also the\nchurch, a situation mirrored within the Anglican Church, including in Kitojo Parish.\nGrady (2000:83) notes that some religious traditions teach that women should not\nseparate from or divorce their partners, even in cases of abuse.

In a similar vein, the church has\ntold batterers that their attempts to manipulate their girlfriends or wives are\nacceptable since women are supposed to submit to men (Ephesians 5:22-24, The Holy\nBible, New International Version, 2012). In addition to immobilizing victims, religious\ncommunities' denial and silence regarding wife abuse may unintentionally encourage\nperpetrators. Given the personal and institutional role of religion in many people's lives,\nit is not surprising that religious teachings influence how women deal with violence.\nThrough doctrines, traditions, and teachings, religious communities impart values and\nbelief systems to their members (Fortune and Enger, 2005:341).\nThe church’s response to violence against women has often been shaped by Judeo-\nChristian cultural beliefs (Fox, 2002:1). In this patriarchal culture, male dominance over\nwomen was seen as natural. Early church history, influenced by the Greco-Roman world,\nsupported Aristotle's theory that men should rule over their wives and children. Feminist\ntheologians argue that both scripture and Christian theology are ingrained in a\npatriarchal culture, perpetuating biases that view women as inferior and in need of\nmale control (Fox, 2002:5). Consequently, church teachings have often legitimized male\nviolence against women. Early church doctrines included instructions that condoned\nmale violence, such as the belief that it was acceptable for husbands to physically\ndiscipline their wives if necessary (Fortune and Enger, 2005:34).\nResearchers have shown that church leaders are often among the first to be approached\nfor advice on family problems and domestic violence.

It does not\nsupport violence in any way. From the beginning, God made both man and woman in\nHis image and wants them to live together in harmony. In Genesis 1:27, the Bible says,\n“So God created man in His own image... male and female He created them.” This shows\nthat men and women are equal before God and both should be treated with respect\nand love.\nThe Bible shows that God's plan for a family is for the husband and wife to love and\ncare for each other. In Ephesians 5:25, it says, “Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ\nloved the church and gave himself up for her.” This verse teaches that husbands should\nnot harm their wives but should protect and care for them. Any form of abuse, whether\nphysical, emotional, or verbal, goes against God's will for marriage.\nJesus Christ always taught people to love one another. In John 13:34, He said, “A new\ncommand I give you: Love one another.” Jesus never allowed violence and always\npromoted peace and forgiveness. In homes, this means that husbands and wives should\nforgive and talk things out instead of fighting or hurting each other. Violence breaks the\npeace that Jesus wants in our lives.\nThe Apostle Paul gave advice on how Christian families should behave. In Colossians\n3:19, he says, “Husbands, love your wives and do not be harsh with them.” This clearly\nshows that God does not allow men to beat or mistreat their wives.

The book of Galatians 3:28 says, “There is neither male nor female, for you are\nall one in Christ Jesus.” This means that God values men and women equally.\nChurches and pastors have a duty to speak against domestic violence. They should\ncounsel families to live in peace. The church should not keep silent when someone is\nbeing beaten or abused at home. Instead, it should guide, support, and help the victims\nto be safe. James 1:27 says that true religion is to “look after orphans and widows in\ntheir distress.” This includes helping abused women and children. Silence only makes\nthe violence continue.\nSome people wrongly use Bible verses like Ephesians 5:22, “Wives, submit to your\nhusbands,” to justify beating women. But the Bible does not say husbands should beat\ntheir wives to make them submit. That verse continues to say that husbands must love\ntheir wives as Christ loved the church. Christ never hurt the church—He died for it. This\nshows that the right understanding of the Bible is against domestic violence.\nThe Bible teaches forgiveness, but it does not mean keeping silent about sin or abuse.\nVictims can forgive abusers, but justice must still be done.

When we talk about theology and domestic violence, we are asking:\n“What does God think about people hurting each other in families?” Theology teaches\nthat all people are made in God’s image (Genesis 1:27), so no one should be beaten,\nabused, or mistreated. God made man and woman equal in value.\nThe Bible shows that God is loving and wants peace in families.

When you read the next verse, it says the husband must love his wife and treat\nher well.\nAccording to Fortune and Enger (2005), theology can help people stop domestic violence\nwhen it teaches love, respect, and kindness.

Marriage conflict, for example, domestic violence, is one of the most common\nissues addressed by church leaders because it can play a significant part in impacting\nfamily life and spiritual life. Despite the church's impact in offering advice, domestic\nviolence is no exception to religious communities because violence can exist in any\nsocial setting, including churches.\nHowever, church leaders are often faced with a dilemma in their response to domestic\nviolence. On one hand, they are duty-bound to defend the sacredness of marriage, but\non the other hand, they have a duty to protect victims of abuse. This balancing act can\nprove tricky to manage, especially because clerics are not necessarily trained or\neducated to deal with such sensitive issues. Research by Levitt and Ware (2006:237)\nhighlights that the majority of the church leaders lack proper training to provide\nassistance to victims of domestic violence. Such a lack of information can lead to\nresponses that are irrelevant to the needs of the victims.\nStudies in countries like the United States and South Africa found that church leaders\nsee domestic violence as a serious issue but admit they are not well-informed about\nappropriate treatment programs, the law, and counseling techniques. Peterson\n(2006:87) notes that this lack of training restricts the actions of church leaders in\nrelation to domestic violence.

Research by Gengler and Lee (2001:51)\nindicates that clerics holding conservative, fundamentalist religious beliefs have a\nnarrow conception of domestic abuse and will remain less likely to respond to cases of\ndomestic violence. These clergy members holding such views can emphasize male\ndominance within marriage and follow archaic gender-role assumptions, leading to a\nlack of intervention in cases of domestic abuse. This clinging to traditional roles may\nalso extend to victim-blaming, where blame for abuse is placed on the victim, further\nobscuring the reaction of the church to abuse.\nIn contrast, studies have found that clergy with greater formal education and training\nin counseling are most suited to handle domestic violence. Lowe (1986:27) concluded\nthat formally trained clergy in counseling resorted to professional means of tackling\ndomestic violence as opposed to prayer and reading the Bible alone. Trained clergy who\nare taught how to recognize signs of abuse and understand the legal and psychological\neffects of domestic violence can better respond appropriately, such as referring victims\nto professional services and community agencies for further assistance.

Feminist theorists argue that violence\nagainst women is not merely a personal issue but also embedded in a system of\ngendered inequality. Feminist theory propounds that men's violence against women\narises from patriarchal structures that give men more power and control over\nrelationships and society as a whole.\nThis theory identifies that the majority of social systems like religious institutions such\nas the church maintain the belief that men need to dominate women. Women in\nchurches, for instance, are trained to be submissive wives and mothers and re-affirm\ntraditional gender roles that support male dominance. Feminist writers argue that such\nbeliefs contribute to a culture where men's violent attitudes towards women are not\nseriously addressed since the cultural norm is that men have to control the behavior,\nactions, and decisions of women. Domestic violence in the home may therefore be\nnormalized or ignored, and women supposed to endure it as part of their family\nresponsibility.\nFeminist theory also points out that religious and cultural institutions, churches\nincluded, are part of this larger system that legitimates male dominance.

This model is critical in the explanation of why domestic violence\nmay be perceived by some to be a concern of lesser magnitude or justified, in some\nreligious communities.\nEcological Systems Theory\nThe ecological systems theory, which was developed by White & Klein (2002:37), is\nanother influential conceptual framework to view domestic violence in the context of\nchurch leadership. This theory suggests that a person's life is shaped through different\ninteracting systems such as family, culture, religion, and society. These systems shape\nhow one perceives and reacts to the world where he/she lives, including how one\nunderstands issues such as domestic violence.\nThe ecological systems theory points out that human growth occurs in different tiers of\ninterrelated environmental systems. The most immediate system is the microsystem,\nwhich consists of the individual's own attributes and immediate surroundings, such as\nhis own family, friends, and community. For an example of a church leader, these would\nconsist of his own religious community and his own marriage and family life.\nThe next system is the mesosystem, and this is an interaction among multiple\nmicrosystems. An instance of this can be an interaction between church leader home\nlife and church work under the mesosystem. The ecosystem also encompasses broader\ncommunity environments, such as social services, legal systems, and community-based\nfamily services that exert an indirect influence on the person's development and choicemaking.", "word_count": 303, "start_char": 48084, "end_char": 50093}

For\nchurch leaders, such intersecting systems — for example, family functioning, cultural\nnorms, and religious doctrine to which they are exposed — influence how they respond\nto domestic violence in their churches.\nCultural Feminist Perspective\nBased on feminist theory, cultural feminists argue that the majority of society's\ninstitutions, including religion, are patriarchal. These institutions are generally\nstructured in manners that reinforce male dominance, and this influences how they\nrespond to issues like domestic violence. Traditional religious, economic, political, and\njudicial institutions are structured based on masculinity, cultural feminists argue, and\nthey perpetuate patriarchal norms, which allow violence against women to persist. As\nsuch, these institutions, including the church, do not necessarily challenge the\nimbalance of power that perpetuates domestic violence.\nThe cultural feminist theorists consider that the church's response to domestic violence\nis guided by these deeply rooted patriarchal values. They suggest that the church's\nteachings may be inadvertently supporting male control over women, and this in turn\nlimits the church from being effective in responding to domestic violence.

The role entrusted to them by the\nchurch gives them the leverage to decide the treatment of domestic violence victims,\nboth directly and indirectly, by influencing the culture of gender roles within the\ncongregation. In Kitojo Parish Nyabiteete Archdeaconry, this function is particularly\nimportant as church leaders are often the initial chain of care for victims. Responses\nby clergy are shaped by professional education, personal spirituality, culture, and the\necclesiastical doctrine they subscribe to (Dickinson, 2007).\nSocial and cultural influence of gender on responses\nGender plays a significant role in shaping the responses of church leaders to domestic\nviolence. Men and women are socialized differently, with distinct expectations placed\non each gender. This socialization influences how both victims and perpetrators of\nviolence are perceived, and how their experiences are addressed by the church.\nPastors, whether male or female, bring different perspectives based on their gender,\nupbringing, and experiences.

In contrast, male pastors may sometimes struggle to relate to these\nexperiences, or they may hold traditional beliefs about male dominance in the family,\nwhich can influence how they respond to women in abusive situations (Steven, 2011).\nIn Kitojo Parish, the church's responses to domestic violence may vary but more\nimportantly, they are also deeply embedded in the cultural understanding of gender\nroles. In many communities, men are often seen as the head of the household, and\nwomen are expected to submit to their husbands. This cultural belief can affect how\nchurch leaders perceive the rights of women in the home and, ultimately, how they\nadvise victims of domestic violence. If the victim is a woman, the pastor's response may\nbe influenced by cultural norms that expect her to endure hardship, forgive, or remain\nsubmissive, even in the face of abuse. On the other hand, some pastors, especially\nthose who are more progressive or trained in family counseling, may advocate for the\nwoman to leave her abusive relationship in order to preserve her dignity and well-being\nThe role of professional training in clergy responses\nThe level of education and professional training that church leaders receive is another\ncrucial factor in shaping their responses to domestic violence.

These leaders can help victims navigate the emotional and psychological\neffects of abuse, providing a safe space for them to express their feelings and fears.\nMost importantly, they can provide concrete advice and referrals to such services as\nlegal aid, medical treatment, and counseling that are absolutely vital to victims seeking\nto exit abusive relationships. Without this level of professional training, clergy may be\nunable to provide the assistance that is necessary or, worse, may actually contribute to\nthe victim's further victimization by providing advice based on outdated or problematic\nassumptions (Dickinson, 2007).\nA range of reactions among church leaders\nIn addressing domestic violence, the church leaders in Kitojo Parish give diverse\nresponses depending on their individual understanding of the issue and the\ncircumstances of the victim's situation. A common response is preaching against\nviolence, explaining clearly that violence is a sin and contrary to Christian teachings.\nChurch leaders may also provide women with counsel to submit to their husbands and\nforgive their abusers, based on their interpretation of scripture like Ephesians 5:22-24,\nwhich instructs wives to submit to their husbands.

Such a response is typically rooted in a more holistic reading of\nChristian teaching that emphasizes the well-being and dignity of individuals, and in this\ninstance, women. For example, the Bible instructs on love, respect, and mutual\nsubmission within marriage (Ephesians 5:21-33), and there are some pastors who\ninterpret this to understand that abuse is never an option in a relationship. These\npastors are able to provide referrals to local domestic violence programs, legal\nassistance, or counseling in a bid to help victims leave abusive situations (Steven, 2011).\nAnother common response of church leaders is to pray for the family and the victim,\nrequesting God's intervention for restoration and healing. As soothing and empowering\nas prayer may be to victims, praying is not the only response that must be taken to\ndomestic violence. The church must do more than that and offer more proactive\nresponses, concrete support, and resources through which victims may be helped\npractically (Dickinson, 2007).\nFramework for Response to Domestic Violence\nChurch officials' responses to domestic violence in the Kitojo Parish are also affected\nby a written and an unwritten set of rules that govern how they handle these issues.\nThese rules of guidance are typically based on biblical teachings and the policy of the\nchurch, which is used to guide the clergy in handling difficult situations.

Failure to have a clear, consistent\nresponse by the church could lead to confusion among clergy and create discrepancies\nin the way domestic violence is approached in different churches in Kitojo Parish.\nIn addition to biblical teaching, church leaders will also be guided by national legislation\nand local church policy regarding domestic violence. These can provide more specific\nguidelines for addressing abuse and helping victims. For instance, the Uganda Church\ncan establish policies to publicly condemn domestic violence and make calls for action,\ne.g., establishment of committees to address domestic violence, congregational\neducation on healthy relationships, and pre-marriage counseling with a focus on\nequality, conflict resolution, and controlling behaviors (Steven, 2011).\nSteps to Improve Church Responses to Domestic Violence\nThe Church of Uganda must engage proactively to assist victims and stop additional\nviolence in order to effectively handle domestic abuse in Kitojo Parish.

Through raising awareness and openly condemning abuse, pastors will be able\nto create a protective environment for victims to talk and seek help. The church can\nalso invite personnel from local domestic violence organizations to conduct educational\nworkshops with the congregation, fostering education and victim support for abuse\nProviding a special day or week to train and activate the congregation about domestic\nviolence matters is an effective method.
