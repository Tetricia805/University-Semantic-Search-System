This research focused on\nidentifying the quality and quantities of grey water in institutions specifically at St.\nFrancis Borgia and going on to recover grey water as a valuable source that if recycled\nand reused for non-potable purposes like irrigation.\nLocal and low cost materials were suggested to be used in grey water treatment and\nquartz sand filters showed promising results. Experiments were made with plain quartz\nsand and treated quartz sand and results showed higher percentage of contaminant\nreduction (between 40% and 80%) with treated quartz sand. Based on results, there was\na suggestion of design of treatment unit using treated quartz sand for adsorption and\nfiltration of grey water to ensure it meets standards for which it is treated for.\n\nii\n\nDECLARATION\nI NIMUSIIMA EDITOR with the registration number M22B32/039, hereby declare that this\nis my original work, is not plagiarized and has not been submitted to any other\ninstitution for any award.\nNIMUSIIMA EDITOR\nM22B32/039\nSignature....................................................\nDate.............................................................\n\niii\n\nAPPROVAL\nThis is to certify that this report has been done by NIMUSIIMA EDITOR under my\nsupervision and is ready for submission to the Department of Engineering and\nEnvironment, Faculty of Engineering, Design and Technology in partial fulfillment of a\nBachelor of Science in Civil and Environmental Engineering of Uganda Christian\nUniversity.\nPROF.

The treatment and reuse of grey water is one of the biggest\nresource recovery and sustainable water use in institutions (Misra, 2020)\nWater scarcity and pressure on freshwater systems are the main reasons for\nincreased sustainable water reuse in the world especially in cities that are rapidly\ngrowing. Globally, 50-70% of the total household wastewater is greywater, and the\nsafe reuse of greywater has been considered one of the main measures for reducing\nthe demand for freshwater (Eriksson et al., 2002). Greywater reuse has already\nbecome a necessity in water stressed areas such as the Middle East, South Asia, and\nEast Africa for irrigation, landscaping and non-potable applications. Research in\ncountries like India, Kenya, and Ethiopia indicate that untreated greywater is a\nmajor cause of nutrient loading, groundwater contamination and clogging of soil\ninfiltration systems (Mbae et al., 2024).\nIn Sub-Saharan African countries, mostly greywater is not treated before disposal\nbecause of the limited infrastructure, poor enforcement of environmental standards\nand the use of economical disposal methods like soak pits (Semiyaga et al., 2015).\nIncreased student numbers lead to more greywater that soon surpasses the capacity\nof the existing systems. Thus, rapid clogging of soak pits occurs leading to overflow\ninto yards and the increased BOD, COD, TSS, and nutrient concentrations reach\nsurrounding soils and aquifers causing increase in vector and pathogens due to\nstagnancy (Matos et al., 2012).", "word_count": 340, "start_char": 10731, "end_char": 13059}

Research studies from East Africa have confirmed\nthat wastewater of institutions usually exceed the discharge limits defined by WHO\nand the national standards (Niwagaba et al., 2021).\nSchools in Uganda generally produce greywater with high BOD (50-120 mg/L) mainly\ndue to the presence of soaps and organic matter, high COD (100-250 mg/L), TSS over\n100 mg/L, and phosphates 3-10 mg/L particularly where commercial detergents are\nused (Niwagaba et al., 2021).\nWorldwide and regionally, low-cost filtration has been practiced with natural and\nmodified sand, biofiltration, and adsorption media besides others. Iron-coated\nquartz sand (ICQS) has been identified as one of the best materials for phosphate\nand organic matter removal with proven scientific techniques, especially in\ndetergent-based greywater (Xu et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2018).\n1.2 PROBLEM STATEMENT\nIn many schools across Mukono District, soak pits are the primary method of grey\nwater disposal. This method is effective for small volumes however it is inadequate\ndue to the growing student population and expanding school activities.\n(Atwebembeire et al., 2019)\nSt. Francis Borgia a secondary school in Mukono disposes its grey water into soak\npits.

(Semiyaga et al., 2015)\nFurthermore, the seepage of untreated grey water poses risks of contaminating\ngroundwater sources used for domestic and institutional purposes. It is extremely\ndifficult to eliminate the risk of ground water contamination when onsite sanitation\nsystems effluent is discharged into sub surface. (Mbae et al., 2024)\nPreliminary tests were carried out and the presence of high BOD, COD, total\nsuspended solids, and nutrients in untreated grey water exceeded recommended\nNEMA standards for discharge and reuse. Such pollution not only degrades the\nenvironment but also increases the risk of waterborne diseases within the school and\nsurrounding communities. The current disposal methods fail to utilize grey water as\na resource, despite its potential for reuse in irrigation thus missing an opportunity\nto conserve water. Experiments (batch and column) were made in the lab for both\n\nplain quartz sand and treated quartz sand and it was found out that the treated\nquartz sand removes the highest percentage of contaminants in grey water due to\nlarge surface area for phosphates and organic matter.

What are permissible limits for grey water discharge into the environment\nand for various reuse options?\n\n1.5 SCOPE OF STUDY\nSt. Francis Borgia High school, Mukono\n1.6 JUSTIFICATION\nIron-coated quartz silica sand has a high adsorption capacity of ferric oxides which\nbind contaminants like phosphate ions through electrostatic interactions as\nphosphate anions are attracted to the positively charged iron surface. (Liu et al.,\n2018) This happens when iron oxides get positively charged under a low to neutral\nPH with a high variance, they are able to attract the negatively charged phosphate\nions.\nFe 3+ +PO4 3- == FePO4 + H2O\nQuartz silica sand has as a porous support material, hard and resistant to abrasion.\nIt enhances flow and its large surface area enhances contaminant removal. Coating\nit with iron oxides significantly improves its adsorption efficiency. (Rusch et al.,\n2010). In presence of oxygen and alkaline conditions, ferric oxides are stable thus\ninsoluble in water.\nIts local availability and low cost, will provide a practical solution to promote water\nreuse and enhance sanitation in institutional settings hence reduction in fresh water\nconsumption. There has been cases of water scarcity in institutions in Mukono as\nreported by Love Binti in 2023 thus this study can address this issue to some extent\nusing locally available materials.\n1.7 SIGNIFICANCE OF RESEARCH\nEnvironmental protection: This study provided a low-cost and eco-friendly solution\nto reducing pollution in grey water before it is discharged into the environment.", "word_count": 384, "start_char": 16421, "end_char": 18893}

By treating grey water, the risks of contamination and\nrelated diseases among school communities were reduced. For example, issues of\nwater related diseases.\nSustainable water management: Institutions will be empowered to recycle and reuse\ntreated grey water for non-potable purposes, thus conserving fresh water resources.\nScientific contribution: The research also contributed to scientific knowledge on the\nuse of modified natural materials ie iron-coated sand in wastewater treatment.\n1.8 THEORETICAL/CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK\nThe adsorption theory rooted in surface chemistry is the basis of this study. This\ntheory states that attractions, either physical or chemical, between solid surfaces\nand pollutants, like phosphates in greywater, are the means for their removal. The\niron coating over quartz sand brings in ferric oxides whose charges are positive and\nbecause of that they tend to associate with the negatively charged phosphate ions\n(PO4^3−) massively and most of the contaminants in grey water are negatively\ncharged thus easy and fast interaction. The interaction causes the contaminants to\nstick to the media surface so they are removed from the water. The filtrate is then\ntreated to eliminate any pollutant that might have evaded the adsorption process.\nCOST BENEFIT ANALYSIS\nA cost benefit analysis was done to find out the benefit of incorporating a grey water\ntreatment plant versus the cost of soak pits, fresh water consumption and use in\nirrigation and other non-potable purposes and it was found out that there are more\ncost benefits in treating grey water for non-potable purposes.", "word_count": 305, "start_char": 18513, "end_char": 20523}

Given\nthat a student uses 18.6 liters of water per day, the total amount of grey water\ngenerated in the next 20 years is 37.2m3\n\nThis indicates that more volumes of grey water will be generated as population keeps\nincreasing\nCalculating savings\nSavings= volume of treated grey water x cost of NWSC water per litre\n\nCHAPTER 2: LITERATURE REVIEW\n2.1 WASTEWATER\nThis refers to used water that contains a mixture of both organic and inorganic\nmaterial that is harmful to the environment (Shah, 2017). It simply means water that\nis not clean because it has been used in households, factories, runoff from farms,\nand others. Wastewater is polluted water, and its pollutants are from both point\nsources and dispersed sources (R L and Mehta, 2020). It is dangerous to the\nenvironment when released without treatment.\nPoint sources: this simply means a single identifiable source of pollution for example\ndrain or a pipe (usually industrial wastewater effluent being discharged by a pipe\ninto a river)\nDispersed/ non-point sources: Also known as diffuse pollution simply mean inputs\nthat happen over a large/ wide area and can be zeroed down to one source. They\nare usually attributed to a specific land use for example urban land use, Agricultural\nland use and factory land use and others. Diffuse pollution is executed by agents like\nstorm water that greatly impact the water quality of the different waterways they\nflow into (EPA, 2021). Wastewater from the different sources affects the quality of\nsurface and ground water.\nCOMPOSITION OF WASTE WATER.\n• Nutrients like nitrates and phosphates", "word_count": 449, "start_char": 20189, "end_char": 22916}

Excess\nphosphorus promotes eutrophication, leading to algal blooms, oxygen depletion, and\naquatic ecosystem damage. It is often contributed by detergents, fertilizers, and\nsewage. Studies show that grey water contributes significantly to nutrient loading in\nlocal rivers (Niwagaba et al., 2021).\nTurbidity refers to the cloudiness of water caused by suspended solids that scatter\nlight. It is measured in Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU). High turbidity can\nindicate the presence of pathogens, organic matter, or pollutants and affects water\nclarity and quality.\npH\npH measures the acidity or alkalinity of wastewater on a scale of 0 to 14. A pH of 7\nis neutral, below 7 is acidic, and above 7 is alkaline. pH affects biological processes,\nchemical reactions, and the solubility of pollutants. Wastewater should have a pH\nbetween 6.5 and 8.5 to be considered safe for discharge.\n\nBiochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)\nBOD is the amount of dissolved oxygen needed by aerobic microorganisms to break\ndown organic matter in water. It is an indicator of organic pollution. High BOD means\nmore organic matter, leading to oxygen depletion in receiving water bodies. It is\nusually high in black water due to high organic matter from human fecal matter.\nChemical Oxygen Demand (COD)\nCOD measures the total quantity of oxygen required to chemically oxidize all organic\nsubstances in water. High COD indicates the presence of significant organic and\ninorganic pollutants\nTSS refers to the solid particles suspended in water that can be trapped by a filter.\nHigh TSS can reduce water clarity, hinder light penetration, affect aquatic life, and\nclog treatment systems. It includes silt, decaying matter, and industrial waste\nparticles.\nElectrical conductivity\nElectrical conductivity in wastewater measures the water’s ability to conduct\nelectricity, which depends on the concentration of dissolved ions such as salts (e.g\nsodium, chloride, sulfate, nitrate). It is expressed in μS/cm (micro siemens per\ncentimeter). High EC indicates a high concentration of dissolved salts or ions from\ndetergents and low EC indicates low salt content, meaning the water is less\nmineralized and relatively clean.", "word_count": 422, "start_char": 22610, "end_char": 25351}

This waste water is less\ncontaminated compared to black water thus treatment is easier.\nPhysical, chemical and microbiological quality of greywater\nPhysical and chemical quality\nThere is a high amount of variability in the chemical and physical quality of\ngreywater produced by institutions, due to factors such as the source of water, the\nwater use efficiency of appliances and fixtures, Individual habits, products used\n(e.g. detergents, shampoos, soaps,) and other site-specific characteristics.\n\nThe amount of salt (sodium, calcium, magnesium, potassium and other salt\ncompounds), oils, greases, fats, nutrients and chemicals in greywater can largely be\nmanaged by the types of products used within an institution or community.\nNutrients\nGreywater contains nutrients generated from the bathroom and laundry. By\nmanaging the type and amount of washing detergents, personal hygiene products\nand cleaning agents that are used, the amount of nutrients in greywater can be\nmanaged.\nSalts\nSalts in greywater originate from washing detergents and are commonly in the form\nof sodium, magnesium and calcium compounds.\nWhy grey water is treated before disposal or reuse\nTreating grey water at household or institutional level reduces the volume and\norganic load entering centralized wastewater treatment plants, improving system\nefficiency and reduces expansion costs (NEMA, 2020).\nProtect Public Health.

One of the\ngreatest properties of quartz is its high surface area and that is why it has found its\nplace in the filtration systems as a filtering media. And since it is an inert material,\nit will not take part in the reaction going on with water or other substances, thus\nkeeping the quality of the treated effluent.\nHowever, uncoated quartz silica sand has a low ability to hold up the pollutants\nmainly because of its negatively charged surface. For it effective with phosphate\nanions, it has to go through a surface modification by getting coated with metal\noxides like iron.\nIron specifically in the form of ferric oxides (Fe2O3, FeOOH) have a tendency to bind\nto phosphate ions.

Not only does this process impart hardness to the filtration medium\nit is also suitable for both batch and column types of greywater treatment systems.\nThe natural adsorption capacity of quartz sand is such a way that it quickly captures\nand gets rid of iron particles thus contributing not only to the water quality but also\nto the longevity of the water infrastructure.

Among\nthe most widely accepted applications are:\n•Toilet flushing and landscape irrigation. In the United States, greywater is most\ncommonly used for watering landscapes, including lawns, ornamental plants, trees,\nand even certain food crops provided the water has been properly disinfected (Matos\net al., 2012).\n•The application of greywater in toilet flushing has been encountered all over the\nGlobe especially Europe (OMS, 2006).\n• Grey water is also used for general washing\n• Also used as a cooling tower make up water.\nSources of grey water\n▪ Hand basins and washing dishes\n▪ Washing machines/laundry tubs, sinks, and water from washing clothes\n▪ Showers and baths etc.\n2.5 GREY WATER TREATMENT SYSTEMS\nGrey water does not typically produce unpleasant odors immediately after it is\ndischarged. However, when stored in a tank without treatment, it rapidly depletes\noxygen and transitions into an anaerobic state. In this condition, it becomes septic,\nforming sludge that may either sink or float depending on the amount of gas trapped\nwithin and its overall density. At this stage, greywater can emit foul smells similar\nto raw sewage and may also harbour anaerobic microorganisms, some of which are\npotentially pathogenic (Matos et al., 2012).", "word_count": 258, "start_char": 30485, "end_char": 32106}

One of the simplest and most suitable approaches is to use\nfreshly produced grey water directly, without allowing it to stagnate (Verstraete et\nal., 2009).\n2.6 GREYWATER TREATMENT METHODS\nThere are many different approaches available for treating grey water (GWT) each\nvarying in terms of how they operate the types of pollutants they target their design\nand the stages of treatment they involve. Choosing the right treatment method\nusually depends on several factors such as the amount of grey water being produced,\nhow much organic matter it contains, what the treated water will be used for and\nthe regulatory standards it must meet (Kulabako et al., 2009).\nTypically, grey water treatment is divided into three key stages: preliminary,\nprimary and secondary treatment. Across the board, there is strong agreement that\ntreatment methods should aim to be environmentally sustainable ideally avoiding\nharsh chemicals or the creation of toxic waste. While some studies suggest that grey\nwater can be stored for a short time before treatment this period should be kept as\nbrief as possible to prevent the growth of harmful microorganisms.\nTreatment techniques vary physical and chemical methods often involve filtration\nand disinfection, while biological processes might include aeration or the use of\nmembrane bioreactors (Oteng-Peprah et al., 2018). Because they can create high\nquality treated grey water, sophisticated systems like sequencing batch reactors and\nbiologically aerated filters are being used more and more all over the world.", "word_count": 305, "start_char": 31775, "end_char": 33753}

These processes consist of activated sludge,\nbio filters, constructed wetlands (nature-based systems that combine filtration,\nadsorption, and biological degradation). (Arden et al., 2018)\nSedimentation in Grey Water Treatment\nSedimentation is one of the simplest and most natural ways of cleaning grey water\nbefore it moves on to more advanced treatment steps. It works on a very basic idea\nif you give water enough time to rest heavier particles will slowly sink to the bottom.\nThis simple action helps remove a big portion of the dirt and solids found in grey\nwater from showers, sinks, and laundry. As grey water comes into the sedimentation\ntank, the water flow is reduced to allow the settling down of different kinds of debris\nsuch as soil, hair, soap and food particles. The sinking materials aggregate into a\nsludge layer on the floor of the tank. This sludge is to be removed at intervals to\nensure the system remains clean and working efficiently. The water which is clearer\nthan before now on the surface is then permitted to pass on to the following\ntreatment stage.\nSedimentation is especially useful because it can significantly reduce several\nparameters making the rest of the treatment process easier and more effective.\nSome of the main parameters reduced include total suspended solids and turbidity.\nThis is the biggest improvement achieved through sedimentation. Most of the solid\nparticles settle out, often reducing TSS by a big percentage.\nBecause the solids settle, the water becomes clearer. Turbidity may drop\nsignificantly.\n\nOther parameters like BOD, COD and microbial load reduce slightly. They may be\nsignificantly reduced by biological processes.\nFactors that influence sedimentation efficiency\n▪ Retention time (1-3 hours)\n▪ Tank depth and type\n▪ Temperature\n▪ Particle size and density\n▪ Presence of surfactants\nTypes of sedimentation tanks\nCircular sedimentation tanks\nThe tanks are circular in shape and influent normally enters at the center and flows\noutward.

It is used in most cases for disposing pre treated waste water from\nseptic tanks, grease traps, and grey water treatment installations.\nIn Uganda and several other countries that can be categorized as low or middleincome, gravel-packing soak pits are a common practice for the disposal of small\nflows of waste water effluent or greywater. The sanitation guidelines refer to soak\npits as inexpensive alternatives that do not require much area of land to be set aside\nand can only accommodate the influence volumes that are relatively small and may\nbe a higher risk of groundwater pollution if they are poorly sited or designed (Ministry\nof Water and Environment, 2018).\nThrough hydraulic infiltration, physical filtration, and biological processes, the\neffluent is infiltrated through the porous pit wall and the surrounding soil at a rate\nwhich is mainly controlled by the soil infiltration rate. The soil infiltration rate is\nobtained through percolation tests and the wetted wall area of the soak pit. Sandy\nor granular soils with high permeability are suitable while clayey or black-cotton\nsoils have very low infiltration rates thus leading to quick ponding, back-up of\nwastewater, and surface overflow.\n\nAs the gray water comes in contact with gravel and soil, it gets rid of suspended\nsolids, soap scum, and very fine particles that are all held within the voids of the\nsoil. Such solids together with microbial biofilm undergo the process of forming a\nclogging layer(biomat) at the interface between the soil and water. This layer\ngradually decreases the effective infiltration capacity of the soak pit (UNHCR &\nEawag, 2024).\n\nFigure 1: Typical soak pit design (UNHCR & Eawag, 2024).", "word_count": 356, "start_char": 41035, "end_char": 43236}

The neutral pH (7.3) and low EC (248.6 μS/cm) are\nfavorable, indicating no acute salinity or acidity issues for treatment or reuse (WHO,\n2006).\n\nTable 3: Results of grey water samples taken from St. Francis Borgia\nPARAMETER\nMORNING\nAFTERNOON\nEVENING\nMEAN\nCOD\n146.3\n128.8\nBOD\n49.3\n74.7\n62.0\nTP\n3.8\n3.1\n5.1\n4.0\n29.6\n26.6\n37.7\n31.3\nTSS\n118.7\n80.3\n152.3\n117.1\nEC\n244.7\n241.7\n259.3\n248.6\npH\n7.3\n7.2\n7.3\n7.3\n4.2 Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)\n\nFigure 5:Variation of COD with time\nMorning\nAfteroon\nEvening\nCOD(mg/L)\nTIME", "word_count": 299, "start_char": 46708, "end_char": 48655}

This trend aligns with greywater patterns in East African\ninstitutions, where evening bathing and laundry activities produce concentrated\norganic-rich greywater (Mbae et al., 2024). COD indicates the amount of oxygen\nrequired to oxidize totally both biodegradable and non-biodegradable organic\nmatter in water. Evening high COD levels could be the result of a large amount of\ngrey water that has high concentrations pointing to the presence of organic\npollutants such as soap residues, oils, and detergents which are typical in grey water\nfrom showers.\nThese pollutants interact with water and thus they require more oxygen for chemical\noxidation since the inorganics cannot be decomposed naturally as shown in fig 5\nAccording to the adsorption theory, the presence of large amounts of biodegradable\nand non-biodegradable organics increases the oxygen demand and determines how\nmuch can be removed by adsorption onto modified media. Treated quartz sand with\niron oxides offers ligand exchange sites and electrostatic attraction that enhance\nbinding of organic anions, partially explaining the improved removal in Table 4.\n\n4.3 Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD)\n\nFigure 6: Variation of BOD with time\nThe BOD value was measured as 74.7 mg/L in the evening, which was above the\nNEMA recommended limit of 50 mg/L for treated effluent discharge. BOD signifies\nthe quantity of oxygen that living organisms would consume while eating away at\norganic matter, or rather in an aerobic situation. A high BOD indicates that the\ngray-water hides a lot of biodegradable organic materials like body fat, soap and\nskin coming from the shower water. If such water is disposed of or reused without\nproper treatment, the oxygen that is needed for microbial breakdown will outcompete the one used by aquatic organisms, which will eventually result in oxygen\ndepletion.\n4.3.1 VARIATION OF BOD AND COD IN GREY WATER THROUGHOUT THE DAY\nGrey water has been mainly produced in schools from kitchen, bathroom, and\nlaundry uses.

These fluctuations are mainly caused by humans' different\nactivities and the differing amounts of water being produced at different times.\nMorning\nThe generation of grey water in the morning is at its highest point when most of the\nstudents and staff take their baths, brush their teeth, and do laundry. Soaps,\ndetergents, body oils, and a little bit of organic matter make up the grey water at\nthis time. Consequently, BOD and COD levels range moderately high because of both\nfresh organic input and higher concentrations.\nOn the other hand, the highwater volume leads to slight dilution thus lowering the\nconcentration of the pollutants a bit. (fig6)\nAfternoon\nIn the afternoon, the production of grey water is less because most daily activities\nhave already taken place. The water might become a bit stagnant, which would\nallow some microbial degradation to happen. The BOD and COD values are moderate\nor slightly lower than in the morning due to the less addition of fresh organic matter\nto the system.\nEvening\nGrey water production in the evening goes up again because of increased bathing\nand cooking activities. This water usually contains food particles, grease, soaps, and\nother organic pollutants in higher proportions. Hence the BOD and COD levels are\nhighest at night due to a higher concentration of pollutants and less dilution\ncompared to the morning period.\n\nInfluence of grey water volume on BOD\nThe volume of water generated has an impact on the Biochemical Oxygen Demand\n(BOD) of grey water. From fig6, when the volume is high, such as during the\nmorning, pollutants are more diluted thereby leading to a lower BOD concentration\n(dilution effect). In the case of the evening when the water volumes are low, there\nis less dilution of pollutants which results in the high BOD values. Hence, the\nconcentration of BOD is inversely related to the volume of grey water produced.\ntable\n4.4 Total Phosphates\n\nFigure 7: Variation of TP with time\nThe total phosphate concentration was found to be 5.1 mg/L, in the evening time\nwhich is slightly above the NEMA standards for effluent discharge of 5 mg/L.

However, the moderate concentration observed in this study is not harmful.\nFor irrigation purposes, such phosphate levels are beneficial, as phosphorus is a key\nnutrient that supports plant growth and root development.\nBut also applying phosphates grey water for irrigation might result in the soil's high\nphosphorus content which could change the chemical composition of the soil causing\nnutrient imbalance.\n4.5 Total Suspended Solids (TSS)\n\nFigure 8: Variation of TSS with time\nThe evening value of Total suspended solids concentration was 152 mg/L which is\nmore than the NEMA discharge limit of 50 mg/L. These values are the main factor in\nthe rapid clogging of soak pits. In Uganda, it has been reported that soak pits with\nTSS >100 mg/L will lose their infiltration capacity within 6–12 months due to the\n\nformation of a bio mat (Semiyaga et al., 2015). The TSS levels are over this limit in\nfig 8 thus demonstrating that the failure of the system was anticipated.\nTSS is made up of very tiny particles like silt, hair, soap residues, and other organic\nwaste usually found in grey water. The presence of high TSS can slow down the water\nmovement in soil and that can eventually lead to sealing up the surface and clogging\nthe soak pits. The high TSS value implies that effective sedimentation or filtration\nis required before the grey water is approved for watering plants.\n4.6 Ph\n\nFigure 9: Variation of pH with time\nThe pH of the grey water was 7.3 in the evening and morning time which falls within\nthe NEMA and WHO acceptable range of 5.0 to 8.5 for effluent discharge reuse.

The\nmeasurement of EC indicates the amount of dissolved ions including sodium,\nchloride, and sulfate that are present in the water. Low EC values indicate low\nsalinity, which is ideal for irrigation because it minimizes the risk of salt\naccumulation in soil and prevents osmotic stress in plants.\nHigh EC values, by contrast, suggest high salt levels that can damage soil structure\nand inhibit plant water uptake. Therefore, the recorded EC value (tab shows that\nthe grey water poses minimal risk of soil salinization and is appropriate for reuse\nafter basic treatment.\n4.8 PERCENTAGE REDUCTION OF CONTAMINANTS WITH PLAIN AND TREATED\nQUATRZ SAND\n4.8.1 COLUMN EXPERIMENTS\nColumn experiments were carried out for adsorption and filtration with different\nbed heights, surface areas and with plain quartz sand and treated quartz sand at\ndifferent contact times.\nResults showed that there is a higher percentage removal of contaminants by\nincrease in contact time from 30minutes to 60minutes and bed height of treated\nquartz sand from 20cm was 40cm because adsorption is time dependent. The plain\nquartz sand showed a smaller percentage of contaminant reduction indicating that\ntreatment(modifying) was necessary. This was indicated by different percentages by\nthe parameters measured before and after treatment of grey water. The treated\n\nquartz sand showed better results possibly because higher adsorption capacity of\niron oxides for contaminants. These findings are similar to studies in Kenya and South\nAfrica where ICQS increased phosphate removal by 40–80% and enhanced organic\nmatter capture (Oteng-Peprah et al., 2018)\nTable 4: Percentage reduction of contaminants by untreated quartz sand and\ntreated quartz sand after column experiments\n\nUntreated quartz sand\nTreated quartz sand\nMedia depth(cm)\nPercentage reduction (%)\nCOD\n11.8\n22.1\n44.1\n47.1\nBOD\n21.6\n29.7\n40.5\n51.4\nTotal phosphates\n34.5\n37.5\n41.2\n50.4\n11.6\n20.8\n49.6\nTSS\n35.2\n39.8\n62.9\n70.3", "word_count": 360, "start_char": 55024, "end_char": 57335}
