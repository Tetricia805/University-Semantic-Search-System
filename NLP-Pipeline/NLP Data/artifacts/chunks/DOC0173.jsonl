A household-level sand filter\nincorporating crushed fired clay as an adsorbent was designed for a household to reduce the Fluoride\nconcentration in their drinking water from the natural raw water levels (2-3 mgF/L) to permissible, healthy\nlevels (0.5-1.0 mg/L). Pieces of fired clay bricks were crushed, and particles of 150 μm to 300 μm in size were\nselectively obtained by sieving. Stream water was filtered through replicate model layered filter columns of the\nprepared clay, sand (fine sand of 150 μm-2 mm; coarse sand of 2-5 mm), and gravel (6-15 mm). It was found\nout that fired clay layers of 2.5 and 5 cm thick reduce the concentration of Fluoride in water by up to 74%, to\nless than 1.0 mg/L. This was deduced by evaluating Fluoride concentration in both the clay and water before\nand after filtration, using the SPADNS Colorimetric method. Use of crushed fired clay for reduction in\nFluoride concentration in drinking water is the focus of this paper.

Seawater\ngenerally contains about 1.0 mg/L, while\nrivers and lakes mostly exhibit concentrations\nof less than 0.5 mg/L. In groundwater\nhowever, low and high concentration of\nFluorides can occur, depending on the nature\nof the rocks and the occurrence of Fluoridebearing rocks (Djossou et al., 2015). Many of\nthe lakes of the African Rift Valley especially\nthe soda lakes, have extremely high Fluoride\nconcentration.\nGeographical areas around the world\nthat have concentrations of Fluoride include\nSyria, Jordan, Egypt, Libya, Algeria and\nMorocco. It also includes the rift valley area\nin Africa from Sudan through Kenya to\nTanzania and Malawi. Another geographical\narea extends from Turkey through Iraq, Iran\nand Afghanistan to India, northern Thailand\nand China. The most affected areas by\nFluoride include India, China and Rift Valley", "word_count": 192, "start_char": 1859, "end_char": 3146}

The maximum value of\nFluoride in these waters is reported to be 3.31\nmg/L and the most affected areas include\nvolcanic areas of Elgon, Mbale, Moroto and\nthe Rift Valley of western Uganda (Malago et\nal., 2017).\nPreliminary tests carried out in October\n2018 on water from Ntabago Stream in\nWestern Uganda showed concentrations of\nFluoride between 2 mg/L to 3 mg/L, which\nhas led to fluorosis and discolouration of teeth\nfor the residents consuming the water (Figure\n1). According to the Ugandan Standard\n(UNBS, 2008), this range is greater than the\npermissible levels (0.5 mg/L to 1.0 mg/L for\npotable treated water, and 1.5 mg/L for\npotable untreated water). This has made the\nwater unsafe for human consumption due to\nhigh concentration of Fluoride in water (Das\nand Mondal, 2016).\nThe National Water and Sewerage\nCorporation (NWSC) has provided piped\nwater, but because of the cost attached, the\nresidents prefer free water from this stream to\npiped water, which makes them susceptible to\nhealth\nrisks\nassociated\nwith\ncontamination\n(Table\n1).\n34%\nof\nthe\npopulation in Rwimi Town Council have\naccess to safe and clean water (MWE, 2018).\nThis implies that the bigger percentage (66%)\nof the population have no access to safe and\nclean water. The focus of this study is mainly\non the potential for defluoridation of water\nfrom Ntabago Stream to permissible levels\nusing crushed fired clay as an adsorbent.\nCrushed fired clay was chosen as it is\nreadily available to households in Uganda\nwhere small scale industries involved in firing\nof clay bricks for construction, firing of\npottery, and charcoal stove linings are\ncommon. Other adsorbents have been studied\nfor fluoride reduction including bone char,\nceramics, and oxides (Djousse Kanouo et al.,\n2020; Yadav et al., 2018; Habuda-Stanić et\nal., 2014; Madhukar et al., 2014; Loganathan\net al., 2013), but these may not be available at\nhousehold level.\n\nFigure 1 Affected residents of the study area showing teeth discolouration.\n\nTable 1: Health impacts of Fluoride in drinking water.", "word_count": 403, "start_char": 2856, "end_char": 5337}

After sieving, the clay was\nwashed to eliminate very fine particles (dust\nof less than 75 μm). Clays reportedly have a\nFluoride adsorption capacity of 84-95 mg/g;\nand over 85% adsorption for clays with high\nAl and Fe content. Heat treatment (firing)\nincreases adsorption capacity (Madhukar et\nal., 2014).\nSand was washed using clean water\nuntil clean water from it was observed. The\nsand was sun dried for two days, and fine sand\nand coarse sand portions were obtained after\nsieving. Coarse sand and fine sand of 2 mm\nto 5 mm, and 150 μm to 2 mm, respectively,\nwere used.\nThe gravel to be used was thoroughly\nwashed with clean water to eliminate dust and\nthen sun dried, after which gravel of size 6\nmm to 15 mm obtained by sieving.\nThe model filter layers were arranged\nwith the gravel at the bottom, followed by\ncoarse sand, then fine sand, and crushed fired\nclay at the top. The gravel and sand layers had\na constant thicknesses (5 cm) while the\ncrushed fired clay had varying layer thickness\n(2.5 cm, 5 cm, 7.5 cm) in each of the three\nmodel filters.\nA 3 mgF/L solution comprised of\ndistilled water and Sodium Fluoride (NaF)\nwas prepared for the model filter test runs.\nAfter stock preparation, the solution was\nanalyzed to confirm the concentration of\nFluoride ions using SPADNS Colorimetric\nMethod (APHA/AWWA/WEF, 1999). 750\nmL of the 3 mgF/L solution was passed\nthrough the model filter in each test run, and\nthe filtrate\nwas analysed for Fluoride\nconcentration.\nThe SPADNS Colorimetric Method\nwas used to determine the concentration of\nfluoride in the water before and after\nfiltration.

The complex, which is proportional\nto the fluoride concentration, tends to bleach\nthe\ndye\nwhich\ntherefore\nbecomes\nprogressively\nlighter\nas\nthe\nconcentration increases. In the case of the\nFluoride ion reaction with Zr-SPADNS\n(sodium\n2-(parasulphophenylazo-)-1,8dihydroxy-3,6-naphthalene disulphonate), the\nresulting coloured complex is measured in a\nspectrophotometer\nat\nnm\n(APHA/AWWA/WEF, 1999; HP, 2000).\nTo determine the clay-adsorbed portion\nof Fluoride, the clay was removed from the\nfilter and a homogenized sample washed\nusing 250 mL of 1 M of hydrochloric acid for\n1-hour in order to extract Fluoride ions in a\nsolution. The acid enabled the detaching of\nthe Fluoride ions from clay particles into the\nwashing solution (Moon et al., 2015).\nAfter one hour, the suspension was\nfiltered using a 0.45 μm micropore filter and\nthe filtrate was then analysed for Fluoride\nconcentration according to the SPADNS\nColorimetric Method as described above.\n\nAdsorption capacity and effect of adsorbent\nlayer thickness\nFluoride reduction with tests with\nmodel filters were carried to determined layer\nthickness of the adsorbent and the initial\nFluoride ion concentration in the solution was\ndetermined at ambient temperature (~25 °C).\nThe Fluoride concentration in the filtrate and\nfired crushed clay from the filter was\ndetermined using SPADNS Colorimetric\nMethod.

Other studies with fired clay show\nsimilar reduction levels (Mottora and Tesema,\n2017).\nThe 7.5 cm clay layer filter reduced the\nFluoride levels by 95% to below 0.5 mgF/L\n(Figure 3), which is a risk factor for dental\ncaries. Reduction in the clay-free control was\nabout 10%. Therefore, the 5 cm clay layer\nfilter was chosen as a conservative option for\nfurther study.\n\nFigure 3: Defluoridation test runs show reduction of Fluoride to within and below the optimum\nrange for dental health in filtrate from model filters with a crushed fired clay layer receiving water\nspiked with 3 mgF/L.\n\nDISCUSSION\nWith the 7.5 cm clay layer, 95% of the\nFluoride could be accounted for in the filtered\nwater and HCl acid-washed clay, which\ncompares favourably with the findings of\nMoon et al., (2015). However, with the 5 cm\nand 7.5 cm clay layers only about 70% of the\nspiked Fluoride was accounted for at the end\nof the test run. It is therefore important to\ncarry out more tests to account for the\nremaining 30% in order to understand the\ndefluoridation process better, and to determine\nhow long the clay layer can remain effective\nbefore needing to be replaced.\n\nFiltered water quality\nRaw water quality improvement in\nother parameters of interest was therefore\nchecked with a 5 cm clay layer test filter\n(Table 2).\nWhile the 5 cm clay layer model filter\nreduces Fluoride levels to optimum, and\nimproves other physicochemical parameters\n(Electrical Conductivity), it produces water\nwhich needs still improvement in Apparent\ncolour, Turbidity and Total Suspended Solids\nlevels (Table 2). Further optimization of the\nsand filter layer thickness is needed for overall\nphysicochemical and biological water quality\nimprovement for household level drinking\nwater treatment.
