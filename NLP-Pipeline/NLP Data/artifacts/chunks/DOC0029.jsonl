Business people face considerable challenges, incredibly uncertain\neconomic conditions due to global competition, and the strengthening of the dollar against the\nshilling. The business sector small and medium size enterprises (SMEs), which have the\npotential to increase economic growth and create new jobs, are expected to make a significant\ncontribution to the Ugandan economy.\nA large number of SMEs are scattered in each region, and their contribution to the Ugandan\neconomy does not make SMEs a vital sector and is free from various problems. In general,\nSMEs often experience delays in their development. According to Abor (2016), most of the\nSMEs are difficult to develop due to various conventional problems that cannot be resolved\nentirely, such as problems with the capacity and quality of human resources, ownership,\nfinancing, marketing, finance, and various other issues related to business management, so\nthat SMEs find it difficult to compete to bigger companies.", "word_count": 332, "start_char": 6625, "end_char": 10669}
{"chunk_id": "DOC0029__00002", "doc_id": "DOC0029", "chunk_index": 2, "text": "ccording to Abor (2016), most of the\nSMEs are difficult to develop due to various conventional problems that cannot be resolved\nentirely, such as problems with the capacity and quality of human resources, ownership,\nfinancing, marketing, finance, and various other issues related to business management, so\nthat SMEs find it difficult to compete to bigger companies.\n\nTherefore, strategic efforts are needed to improve the performance and sustainability of\nSMEs. One of the ways that can be done is by enriching the knowledge of SMEs people on\nfinancial expertise so that management and accountability can be better accounted for as\nbefits a large company (Adomako et al., 2016; Sadat & Lin, 2018).\nFinancial literacy is an important thing that must be owned by SMEs manager in achieving\nsuccess and improving business performance. However, there are still many people, including\nSMEs in Uganda, who do not understand financial literacy well. In the third National\nFinancial Literacy Survey (SNLIK) conducted by the Financial Services Authority (OJK) in\n2017, the financial literacy index reached 38.03%, and the financial inclusion index\n76.19%. Based on the regional strata, for urban areas, the financial literacy index reached\n41.41%, and the financial inclusion for urban communities was 83.60%. In comparison, the\n\nliteracy index and financial inclusion for rural communities were 34.53% and 68.49%\n(OJKRI, 2017).\n\nLow financial literacy level makes it difficult for SMEs to access funding because they are\nunable to produce financial reports properly and inaccurate financial management.\nGood financial literacy can minimize financial risks that occur in corporate organizations\nbecause the financial risk attitude allows entrepreneurs to identify opportunities and risks\nassociated with business and financial decisions. It is also found that financial risk attitudes\naffect the organization's financial decision-making process.

According to Kimani & Ntoiti (2015), financial literacy allows\nentrepreneurs to make projections of income and expenditure, thus concluding that debt\nmanagement, budget planning. Banking services and training on record-keeping that made it\neasier for them to access credit had a positive effect on business performance.\nAlso, some research (Aribawa, 2016; Dermawan, 2019; Dewi, Yurniwati, & Annisaa, 2018)\nobtained significant positive results between the effects of financial literacy, access to\nfinance, and the performance of SMEs. Meanwhile, other research (Eresia-Eke & Raath,\n2013; Fowowe, 2017; Kumalasari & Asandimitra, 2019; Olawale & Garwe, 2010; Sibanda,\nHove-Sibanda, & Shava, 2018) show a significant negative effect of financial literacy, access\nto finance, and SMEs performance.\nPrevious research on the effect of financial literacy and financial risk attitudes on SMEs\nperformance has also found several different results. According to Esiebugie, Richard, &\nEmmanuel (2018), the financial attitudes affect the performance of SMEs. However, most\nSMEs managers and owners have poor attitudes towards their financial activities. Their low\nfuture orientation evidence this, inability to take risks, and lack of participation in training\nprograms that can promote their financial skills despite the knowledge of the importance of\ndirecting short-term activities towards the long-term goals of the company.

It also deals with the actual review of literature that was done by previous\nscholars objective by objective. The rationale of the literature review is to discuss the existing\nliterature with the objective of revealing contribution made by earlier scholars.\n2.2 The impact of Financial Literacy on SMEs Performance\nAccording to Remund (2010), financial literacy is knowledge of all the basics of finance,\nunderstanding financial concepts, and is used as an individual or individual or company\ndecision-making. Meanwhile, Aribawa (2016) explains that financial literacy is knowledge of\nfinancial concepts, abilities, and skills related to financial concepts, skills in business\nmanagement, the ability to make strategic business decisions, relatively precise and fast in\ncertain situations. Moreover, Financial Services Authority of Indonesia (OJK) in 2016\ndefines that financial literacy is not limited to the understanding the product and services in\nfinancial institutions. This financial literacy can make the ability for people to arrange the\nfinancial goals, to compile financial planning, to manage finances and be able to make a good\nfinancial decision in using financial products and services.\nPrevious research argue that the level of personal financial literacy has an impact on their\nability to make the right financial decisions. Knowledge of personal finance will affect their\nfinancial future (Chen & Volpe, 1998; Lusardi & Mitchell, 2011). The findings can also be\nadapted for companies. In this case, MSMEs that have good financial literacy will be able to\nmake the right business decisions, have a business development orientation and be able to\nsurvive in their business. Furthermore, it is also found that the low level of financial literacy\nin financial statement will make the small business financial condition poorly (Dahmen &\nRodríguez, 2014). Moreover, it is mentioned that the financial literacy will make the small\nbusiness survive in the competition (Wise, 2013). Financial literacy refers to the financial\nknowledge and abilities which enable entrepreneurs to implement effective financial\nmanagement strategies for their enterprises. Literacy is defined as the ability to read and write", "word_count": 407, "start_char": 16429, "end_char": 19201}

Financial literacy\nis defined as the degree to which one understands essential financial concepts and possesses\nthe ability and confidence to manage personal finances through appropriate, short-term\ndecision-making and sound, long-range financial planning, while mindful of life events and\nchanging economic conditions\n(Remund,2 010). Huston, (2010) acknowledged that a generally accepted definition of\nfinancial literacy among researchers did not exist and this has led to researchers developing\ntheir meaning of the construct. For that reason, Zuhair et al., (2015) argued that a lack of a\ncommonly used definition was indicative of the fact that financial literacy was multidimensional and had a different meaning to researchers and academicians.\nHowever, according to Klapper et al., (2012) financial literacy is a combination of awareness,\nknowledge, skill, attitude and behavior necessary to make sound financial decisions and\nultimately achieve individual financial wellbeing, this was basically in line with what\nLusardi, (2013) said, that financial literacy is a blend of awareness, knowledge, skill, attitude,\nand behavior essential to make full financial decisions and ultimately accomplish individual\nfinancial well-being. Recently, Schuhen, (2014) convey the most and widely accepted\ndefinition for financial literacy all over the world consisting of three main pillars as financial\nknowledge, attitudes and behaviours.\nHowever, financial literacy has got an increasing interest in both developed, and developing\ncountries including Uganda. Nonetheless, Matewos, (2016) carry out a review on financial\nliteracy for developing countries in Africa and the result showed low level of financial\nliteracy in both developed and developing countries and concludes that policymakers and\nacademics in African developing countries need to understand the level of financial literacy\nin the population, in order to devise suitable financial education and other related policy\ninterventions to improve personal financial literacy for its benefits of enhancing individual\nsocio-economic welfare and building an inclusive financial system and sustainable economic\ngrowth.\nConsequently, according to Eresia-Eke and Raath, (2013) financial literacy is about\ndiscernment and making effective decisions on utilization of financial management. With that\nthe person can use various substitutes for instituting financial objectives which relate to an\nindividual knowledge of financial concepts and products which in turn affects the\nindividual’s value system and behavior, consequently impacting positively on the personal", "word_count": 425, "start_char": 18852, "end_char": 21889}

Notably, on the increasing complication of\nfinancial markets (Miller et al., 2009, Lusardi & Mitchell, 2013b) increasing cost of business\nfailure (Chepkemoi et al., 2017, Lusardi & Tufano, 2015) which all demand personal\nfinancial management capability in both individual and business, are among the repeatedly\ncited reasons behind enhancing financial literacy in both developed and developing countries\n(Matewos, 2016).\nMoreover, Matewos, (2016) emphasized that financial literacy is not only at the benefit of\nindividuals or business, but is equally at the paramount interest of financial service providers\nand soundness of the financial system. Chepkemoi, (2017) studied the effects of financial\nliteracy training on business profitability by SMEs in the coastal region of Kwale County on\na sample of 74 SMEs drawn from the Kinang, Matuga and Msambweni. The findings\nrevealed that financial literacy positively influenced the performance of SMEs and enhanced\nprofitability. Four variables were examined: working capital management, savings,\nbookkeeping and financial accessibility skills, profitability being the dependent variable.\nThe findings concluded that financial literacy affected the profitability of SMEs.\nAdditionally, the study was also in line with the findings of Sabana Beatrice, (2014) studied\nthe influence of financial literacy and performance of microenterprises in Nairobi County,\nKenya and the result established that financial literacy has a statistically significant influence\non microenterprise performance. It is also consistent with a study carried out by Joseph,\n(2017) on the correlation between credit schemes and financial accessibility, and the findings\nestablish a clear correlation between business performance and financial access.\nIn addition, it further confirms the findings of Jacqueline Siekei, (2013) who carried out a\nstudy on the effect of financial literacy education on performance of small businesses in\nNjoro, Kenya and established that training in financial awareness, budgeting and credit\nmanagement improved the performance of entrepreneurial business owners. In confirming\nthe influence of financial literacy on the business performance of entrepreneurs, the study\nachieved the fourth objective of the study by founding the influence of financial literacy on\nentrepreneurial business performance in Bauchi metropolis Nigeria. Moreover, Njoroge,\n(2013) studied the relationship between financial literacy and entrepreneur success among\nSMEs in Nairobi City County, Kenya and the findings established that financial literacy had a\nstatistical significance influence on entrepreneurial business performance.

Access to Finance increases financial inclusion and contributes to the deepening\nof the financial sector and overall economic growth. Financial inclusion aims to attract the\nunbanked population into a formal financial system to enable them to access a variety of\nfinancial services including savings, payments, money transfers, credit and insurance (Hannig\n& Jansen, 2010). Development theory also emphasizes the importance of access to finance in\novercoming income inequality and achieving a country's economic growth (Nkundabanyanga\net al., 2014). Access to finance also plays an essential role in the development of Small and\nMedium Enterprises (SMEs) (Kimani & Ntoiti, 2015; Nkuah et al., 2013).\nWaithanji (2014) studied the relationship between of financial accessibility on the financial\nperformance of small and medium enterprises in Kiambu County, Kenya. The study was\ndone through the use of survey design. Out of the 2,061 SMEs licensed, the study randomly\nsampled 60 SMSs. The study found that there is a direct relationship of financial accessibility\nand financial performance of the companies. The study also concludes that the enterprises\nbenefit from loans from microfinance institutions, the SMEs seek financial assistance from\nthe MFIs due to interest rate, easy loan repayment and amount offered (Osoro and Muturi,\n2013). There is need to provide an enabling environment for SMEs to grow and thrive,\ntherefore there is a need to develop strategies to enhance increased access to financial\naccessibility by SMEs from commercial banks and microfinance institutions. In a related\nview, financial accessibility in Uganda provides assistance to SMEs in the area of accounting,\nfinancial management and entrepreneurship that complies with national accounting\nrequirements and/or best practices, this will improve the performance of SMEs (Nkurunziza,\n2015). The inaccessibility of credit and capital is a major impediment to the development of\nSMEs, particularly because it prevents them from acquiring the new technology that would\nmake them more productive and more competitive.\nMoreover, the results of previous studies found that financially literacy of the SMEs increase\ntheir access to financial resources through the timely dissemination of financial information", "word_count": 452, "start_char": 24316, "end_char": 27410}
{"chunk_id": "DOC0029__00009", "doc_id": "DOC0029", "chunk_index": 9, "text": "he inaccessibility of credit and capital is a major impediment to the development of\nSMEs, particularly because it prevents them from acquiring the new technology that would\nmake them more productive and more competitive.M\n\noreover, the results of previous studies found that financially literacy of the SMEs increase\ntheir access to financial resources through the timely dissemination of financial information\n\nthat can be used to related parties, such as bankers or lenders, thereby convincing funders.\nHowever, SMEs with low financial knowledge, they find it challenging to access finance\n(Mashizha & Sibanda, 2017; Van Auken & Carraher, 2013). In addition, the result of\nprevious studies found that financial literacy improves the physical access and feasibility of\nSMEs to financial resources, as well as makes finance more affordable and makes it easier to\ncreate a healthy capital structure, thereby improving business performance (Adomako et al.,\n2016; Cowling et al., 2014; Hussain et al., 2018; Kimani & Ntoiti, 2015). Measurement of the\nvariable access to finance for MSME manager in this study consists of indicators of\nownership and utilization of accounts for service providers and financial services which\nrefers to Adomako et al. (2016).\nThere is a strong relationship between financial accessibility and performance of SMEs\n(Kasekende and Opondo, 2013). The inaccessibility of credit and capital is a major\nimpediment to the development of SMEs, particularly because it prevents them from\nacquiring the new technology that would make them more productive and more competitive.\nAccess to finance will provide assistance to SMEs in the area of accounting, financial\nmanagement and entrepreneurship that complies with national accounting requirements\nand/or best practices, which will improve the performance of SMEs (Turyahebwa et al.,\n2013). Entrepreneurs and small business owners often turn to access to finance in order to\nestablish or expand their business ventures. Business enterprises that choose this method of\nsecuring funding, which is commonly called debt financing, need to be aware of all\ncomponents of those loan agreements, including interest.\nAccording to Kelley and Nakosteen (2015), financial accessibility is not a problem as long as\nthe borrowed money is invested in ventures with high rate of return. They however found out\nthat for this to be achieved, a big amount of capital should be accessed by the borrowers in\norder for them to increase their levels of investment so as to enjoy economies of scale. Their\nfinding was confirmed by Koech (2011) who found out that loan performance is influenced\nby the loan size and loan repayment period. According to him, the bigger the amount of\nborrowed money with longer repayment, period the better will be the liquidity of the\nenterprise as well as high levels of profitability that will be achieved after meeting the\nobligation of loan repayment", "word_count": 455, "start_char": 26999, "end_char": 29928}

Perceptions of risk play an important role in human behavior, especially in\nrelation to decision making in uncertain situations. Perceived risk is defined as a person's\nassessment of a risky condition (uncertainty) which is strongly influenced by psychological\nfactors and the decision-making situation. The degree of uncertainty will be evaluated and\nassessed differently by different decision makers. The tendency to risk is the tendency of a\ndecision maker to take or avoid risks. The likelihood of risk changes as circumstances change\nso that it is considered an accumulated result of (Ye & Kulathunga, 2019). Business and\nfinancial risks are assumed to increase rapidly in line with economic instability in developing\ncountries such as Indonesia. SMEs entrepreneurs must face challenging economic conditions\nand must be prepared to survive in the midst of global competition.\nThis explains that SMEs in emerging markets must manage risk efficiently to ensure the\nsurvival of their organizations (Oláh et al., 2019). Moreover, the results of previous research\nfound a positive relationship between financial literacy and financial risk attitudes. High\nfinancial literacy can manage financial risk attitudes efficiently so that SMEs actors can solve\nproblems and make decisions appropriately in running their business (Goswami, Hazarika, &\nHandique, 2017; Hsiao & Tsai, 2018). Measurement of the variable of financial risk attitudes\nof SMEs players in this study consists of indicators of risk perception and risk tendency\nwhich refers to the research of Ye & Kulathunga (2019).\n\nSMEs are regarded as engines of economic growth and development in any given economy.\nAccording to Ariyo (2005), SMEs are responsible for about 97 percent of all businesses in\nNigeria, employing about 50 percent of Nigeria’s workforce and accounted for about 50\npercent of the industrial outputs in the country.

The\n\npayment for the goods or services translates into survival, growth, and profit for the\nenterprise in question. In the opinion of Cokins (2004), the primary reason for embarking on\nperformance measurement is to assist business operators to sense business uncertainties early\nand respond appropriately to them more quickly. However, the concept of performance\nmeasure is contextual in relation to enterprise, industry, and sector. The parameter for\nperformance measurement has been a matter of debate amongst several authors.

The questionnaire\nmethod will help in eliciting specific responses which are easy to analyze. This method will\nbe economical in terms of time management as questionnaires are easy to fill and will take\nless of respondents` time and that of the researcher in administering and analyzing them\n(Amin, 2005). The questionnaires will be issued to all the 62 selected respondents.\n3.7 Data Collection Instruments\n3.7.1 Questionnaires\nA structured questionnaire with closed ended questions will be used to collect information\nfrom the randomly sampled respondents.\n3.7.2 Interview Guide\nThe interview guide will be developed by the researcher to be used when conducting\ninterviews for the purposive sampling strategy as guided by Marjorie (2003). Marjorie asserts\nthat in every community, family, neighborhood, workplace and schools, there are people who\nhave knowledge and skills to share.\n3.8 Data Analysis\nData will be organized in a manner that facilitates analysis and it involves data being\nconverted to numerical codes, a process known as coding. Completed questionnaires will be\nedited for completeness, accuracy, uniformity and comprehensiveness. The interview guide\nwill be used to check the feedback from the respondents, noting the relationships between the\ngiven answers and asked questions. The data analysis will help the researcher to make\nconclusions on the previously stated hypothesis.\n\nThe data collected will be summarized using descriptive analysis such as frequencies and\nmeasures of central tendency that is; mean and standard deviation statistics by use of SPSS to\nenable the researcher meaningfully describe a distribution of scores or measurements. The\ndata will be presented in the form of descriptive tabulations, percentages, frequencies, mean\nand standard deviation before a comprehensive analysis of statistics is generated to determine\ntheir relationships.\n\nCHAPTER FOUR\nPRESENTATION, ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION OF FINDINGS\n4.1 Introduction\nThis chapter presents the study findings on financial literacy and performance of small-scale\nbusinesses.

This chapter presents a\nsummary, discussion, conclusions and recommendations of the study on credit risk\nmanagement and financial performance. The first section presents a summary of the study\nfindings in relation to the specific objectives. This is followed by a discussion, conclusion,\nand recommendations of the study in relation to the objectives of the study. Limitations of the\nstudy, contributions of the study and recommendations for further studies are also presented\nin this chapter.\n5.2 Summary of the key findings\n5.2.1 Financial Literacy and performance of SMEs\nBased on the research results, it is known that financial literacy has a positive influence on\nthe performance of SMEs so that the first hypothesis is suspected that there is an effect of\nfinancial literacy on the performance of SMEs in Mukono to be accepted. So, this study also\nconfirms and aligns with the previous studies according to (Adomako et al., 2016; Dahmen &\nRodríguez, 2014; Fatoki, 2014; Kimani & Ntoiti, 2015; Wise, 2013).\nIn addition, it is noted that the SMEs managers have weakness regarding the loan from the\nbank then it is implied that the government need to find the way to enhance the capability of\nthe manager in this knowledge as it is needed to finance the firm. Moreover, from the\nindicator of SME performance it also is found that the managers have difficulties in\nmanaging the cost. The results of this study serve as a warning to the Ugandan government to\naccelerate the SME skills and knowledge improvement program considering that this finding\nhas been disclosed by several previous studies (Abiodun & Entebang, 2015; Tambunan)", "word_count": 353, "start_char": 46608, "end_char": 48867}

The mean values suggest that, on average, SMEs somewhat agree that loans\nprovided are needed, the terms and conditions of the loans are favorable, and the financial\nservices offered by the bank help their businesses grow. Furthermore, SMEs find the account\nopening charge fee to be affordable and consider the lending rates to be low and favorable.\nHowever, the relatively high standard deviations for some items indicate significant\nvariability in responses, indicating differing opinions among SMEs. It's important to note that\nthe mean value for comparing loans from SACCOS to those offered by the bank suggests\nthat, on average, SMEs somewhat agree that SACCOS loans are better, but the standard\ndeviation shows variability in opinions\nThe findings of this study confirm the previous studies of the hypothesis. The access to\nfinance will enhance the performance of the SMEs (Kimani & Ntoiti, 2015; Nkuah et al.,\n2013). It is also found a positive impact of financial literacy on the access of finance\n(Mashizha & Sibanda, 2017; Van Auken & Carraher, 2013). Furthermore, this study also\nprovide the positive impact of access to finance on the SMEs performance (Adomako et al.,\n2016; Claessens, 2006; Cowling et al., 2014; Hussain et al., 2018; Kimani & Ntoiti, 2015;\nYang, Chen, Gu, & Fujita, 2019). In addition, this study also found that the manager of the\nSMEs has problems in access to finance as the proportion of the manager who are not\nfamiliar with the bank product are more than 30%.\n5.2.3 Risk Attitude on SMEs performance\nThis study found the positive impact of financial risk attitude on MSMEs performance,\nconfirming the findings of previous studies (Gärling et al., 2009; Oláh et al., 2019;\nWillebrands, Lammers, & Hartog, 2012). The findings also support the argument that people\nwith higher level of financial literacy can manage financial risk attitudes efficiently so that\nSMEs can solve problems and make decisions appropriately in running their business\n(Goswami et al., 2017; Hsiao & Tsai, 2018; Widdowson & Hailwood, 2007). Finally, this\nstudy also explores the mediation role of financial risk attitudes on a positive relationship\nbetween financial literacy and SMEs performance. This result is in line with the previous\nresearch by Rooij, Lusardi & Alessie (2011).", "word_count": 461, "start_char": 48497, "end_char": 51397}

The standard deviations for all statements are relatively high,\nranging from approximately 1.154 to 1.261. This indicates that there is a significant variation\nin respondents' opinions on these statements.\n5.3 Conclusion\nFinancial Literacy and SME Performance. The research shows that financial literacy has a\npositive influence on the performance of SMEs in Mukono. This aligns with previous studies\nthat have also demonstrated a similar positive relationship between financial literacy and\nSME performance. It is essential for the Ugandan government to accelerate SME skills and\nknowledge improvement programs, especially in areas related to managing loans and costs,\nas these were identified as areas of weakness for SME managers.\nAccess to Finance and SMEs Performance. Access to finance plays a crucial role in\nenhancing the performance of SMEs. The study highlights that SMEs generally agree that\nloans, terms, and financial services from banks are favorable. However, there is variability in\nopinions, indicating that some SMEs may still face challenges in accessing finance. The\nfindings confirm previous studies that have also established a positive impact of access to\nfinance on SME performance.\nRisk Attitude and SMEs Performance. Financial risk attitude has a positive impact on SME\nperformance. SMEs with a higher level of financial literacy can better manage financial risk,\nenabling them to make appropriate decisions and solve problems efficiently in their business\noperations. The study also explores the role of financial risk attitudes as a mediator in the\nrelationship between financial literacy and SME performance, suggesting that having a\npositive risk attitude can enhance the benefits of financial literacy on SME performance.\nNeutral Sentiments on Risk Attitude and SME Performance. Respondents generally\nexpressed neutral sentiments on statements about risk attitude and SME performance.
