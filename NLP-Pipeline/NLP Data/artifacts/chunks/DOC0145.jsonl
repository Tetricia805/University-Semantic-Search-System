Nevertheless, it is significant to recognise the big gap in\nconsumption between rich and poor. Around 10% of the richer populaces of the world account\nfor approximately half of global greenhouse gas emissions in control for climate change\n(UNEP, 2020). These unsustainable practices have backed the existing major environmental\ncrises like climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution (UN, 2020). This has two\nimplications: one being the urgent need for both social and ecological transformation; and two,\nthe need to address high levels of inequality.\nSustainable Consumption and Production (SCP) aims to minimize the negative environmental\nimpacts from consumption and production systems, considering all stages of the life-cycle of\nproducts and services while promoting quality of life for all. Efforts concerning sustainable\nconsumption and production (SCP) have been crucial and prevalent during the past few\ndecades. Both business and governments have worked tirelessly to decouple economic growth\nfrom the environmental degradation that has consistently accompanied it (UNEP, 2008). The\nmeasures adopted and solutions implemented by the business world range from pollution\ncontrol to improved industrial efficiency (environmental resources exploited per unit of\noutput), reached through organizational measures and the adoption of new technologies.\nDeveloped countries like China and Canada and international organizations have set up\nprograms, policies, and regulations targeted toward sustainability. The European Union, for\nexample, has adopted several new modes of communication and policy since the inception of\nthe Fifth Environmental Action Programme (European Commission 1992), encompassing\nnumerous conventions and protocols at the global and local levels, notably the Kyoto Protocol\n(UNFCCC 1997).", "word_count": 350, "start_char": 7562, "end_char": 9996}

The development of national and local SCP programmes in numerous African countries\nhas placed the ground for highlighting the importance of SCP in attaining sustainable\ndevelopment in Africa, (Prosperity, 2019). The backing offered by the Marrakech Task Force\non Cooperation with Africa in endorsing SCP in the region displays that partnership is too vital\nin attaining sustainable development and lessening of poverty in Africa.\nThrough inspiring countries to endorse Sustainable production and consumption technologies\nof Agenda 21, the government of Uganda promoted for the introduction of better production\napproaches through all crucial segments of the economy. The part of sustainable consumption\nis gradually attracting thoughtfulness to the quality and safety parts of products in addition to\nprices (Vergragt, 2013). Progressively, new people are nowadays giving attention to related\nfeatures plus labels, data sheets, chemical composition, product efficiency, and disposal after\nuse and impacts on the environment.\nMore sensitisation, capacity development and technical assistance is however still critical to\nimprove people’s appreciation of eco-labels and other certification systems. The identified\npriority areas of the SCP Programme in Uganda are demonstration of Cleaner Production (CP)\neffectiveness, information exchange and dissemination of technical information, and\nharvesting and demand-side management of energy use were selecting for piloting (Hall,\n(2011).\nThe coca cola company incorporated on September 5, 1919 is a beverage company.

These crises and related\nenvironmental degradation, threaten human well-being and achievement of sustainable\ndevelopment goals. In spite of the increasing participation of government of Uganda and all\ncitizens working together to improve resource efficiency, reduce waste and pollution and shape\na new circular economy, little or no impact on the change of attitude and implementation of\nsustainable production and sustainable consumption has been achieved (Shove, 2019).

Hence, the need to carry out this study to establish the cause for this mismatch.\n1.3 General objective of the study\nThe general objective of the study was to investigate the impact of sustainable production on\nsustainable consumption.\n1.4 Specific objectives\nThe specific objectives of the study are;\ni.\nTo assess the factors for achieving sustainable production at Coca-Cola company\nNamanve branch.\nii.\nTo analyse the challenges encountered in implementing sustainable consumption at\nCoca-Cola company Namanve branch\niii.\nTo suggest possible ways of ensuring sustainable production and sustainable\nconsumption at Coca-Cola company Namanve branch.\n1.5 Research questions\ni.\nWhat are the factors for achieving sustainable production at Coca-Cola Company\nNamanve branch?\nii.\nWhat are the challenges encountered in implementing sustainable consumption at\niii.\nWhat are the ways of ensuring sustainable production and sustainable consumption\nat Coca-Cola Company Namanve branch?", "word_count": 279, "start_char": 12061, "end_char": 14023}

The study\nthen assessed the factors for achieving sustainable production at Coca-Cola Company\nNamanve branch, analysed the challenges encountered in implementing sustainable\nconsumption at Coca-Cola Company Namanve branch and suggested possible ways of\nNamanve branch.\n2.0 Introduction\nSustainable Consumption and Production (SCP) can be defined as: a holistic approach to\nminimising the negative environmental impacts from consumption and production systems\nwhile promoting quality of life for all (Bhuiyan, 2015). Thus, while Sustainable Consumption\nand Production (SCP) may mean different things to different people, it can generally be agreed\nthat SCP is about systemic change, decoupling economic growth from environmental\ndegradation and applying a lifecycle thinking approach that takes into consideration all phases\nof resource use in order to do more and better with less. It has rightly been pointed out that a\nmajor challenge in environmental policymaking is determining whether and how fast our\nsociety should adopt sustainable management methods as these decisions may have long lasting\neffects on the environment.\nIn the 1970s, the scientific community began to realize that unsustainable development was\nleading toward environmental and economic collapse. This warning is also known as “limits\nto growth”, which was proposed by the Club of Rome, (Southerton, 2018). After decades of\neconomic development, sustainable development (SD) is assumed to be an attempt “without\nalternative” for the survival of humankind (Geels, 2018). As a predominant goal and crucial\nnecessity for establishing SD, the integration of consumption and production systems with SD\nwas formulated and implemented (Spaargaren,2019). The concern over sustainable\nconsumption and production (SCP) patterns has been elevated to an unprecedented level and\nhas gained international prominence. A series of international conferences related to on-going\nclimate changes and SCP matters have been held. The Johannesburg Plan of Implementation\nin 2002 called for all countries to promote SCP patterns with the developed countries taking\nthe lead and with all countries benefiting from the process, and a decade later, the United\nNations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) reaffirmed that SCP was a\ncornerstone of SD, proposing a 10-Year Framework of Programmes on SCP patterns.", "word_count": 419, "start_char": 17690, "end_char": 20607}

Committing to\nminimise waste is recognised as desirable in managing resources. Waste minimisation is\ndescribed as ‘the reduction of waste’ at source recognising that is cheaper not to produce waste\nin the first place. Waste minimisation covers activities aimed at reducing wastes from raw\nmaterial and ingredient use, product loss, water consumption and effluent generation, paper\nand packaging, factory and office consumables, energy consumption, all other solid, liquid and\ngaseous wastes, and wasted effort (Akenji, 2014).\nSupply chain management (SCM) involves the flow of goods and services from origin to\nconsumption, aiming to reduce costs, improve quality, and foster product innovation. As\nenvironmental concerns grow, manufacturers are adopting green practices in SCM to meet\nenvironmental and social goals. Barber (2003) suggests that green supply chain management\ncan enhance company performance, competitiveness, and meet stakeholders' demands for\nenvironmental protection, aligning with Berg's (2011) findings that enterprises face pressure\nfrom stakeholders, including NGOs, to integrate social and environmental issues into SCM.\nResource efficiency also called resource productivity, has received much attention recently\nbecause it is not only focused on managing resources as a whole rather than being limited to\none stage of the resource's life, such as waste minimisation and pollution prevention which\ncentred the focus on waste (cause) and its polluting effect but also on reducing the consumption\nof primary materials without affecting the level of output qualitatively. The UK government\nactively promotes resource efficiency as a part of its sustainable development policy (Bilen,\n2008). This strategy aims to efficiently use and reduce the flow and consumption of resources\nfrom nature (Hukkinen, 2011). Unlike past approaches, resource efficiency considers the entire\nlifecycle of resources, focusing on waste reduction, resource conservation, and\nenvironmentally-friendly production processes (Brizga, 2014). By curbing resource extraction\nand emissions, the government aims to reduce environmental damage and exhaustion nonrenewable resources.\nExternal pressure as in recent years as enterprises have been increasingly influenced by the\npressure from governments, international standards and their communities regarding both\nenvironmental and social issues to the extent that current measures of organizational\ncompetitiveness have changed from managing costs to sustainability. According to previous\nstudies, external pressure is divided into two parts, namely, regulatory pressure and\nstakeholder’s pressure. Regulatory pressure from international and domestic regulations are", "word_count": 445, "start_char": 20223, "end_char": 23441}
{"chunk_id": "DOC0145__00010", "doc_id": "DOC0145", "chunk_index": 10, "text": "ccording to previous\nstudies, external pressure is divided into two parts, namely, regulatory pressure and\nstakeholder’s pressure.R\n\negulatory pressure from international and domestic regulations are\n\ninfluencing various industries to adopt and prioritize sustainable manufacturing processes,\nurging them to implement green practices, (Burja, 2009) for example the Montreal Protocol\n(1987), Kyoto Protocol (1997) and ISO standards. Stakeholders play a crucial role in\nencouraging companies to adopt sustainable manufacturing practices and engage in process\nand product innovation. Pressure from stakeholders in the supply chain can lead companies to\nbecome more sustainability-conscious, prompting the establishment of sustainability goals and\npractices in response to stakeholder demands (Ward, 2007; Cohen, 2010).\nEco‐efficiency is the broadest strategy, because it not only aims to prevent waste and increase\nresource productivity but also to ensure minimal impact towards ecology while improving the\nquality of life all without exceeding Earth's limits, (Chang, 2013). Thus, it is bigger in scope,\ncovering economic, social and ecological dimensions, and is not limited to the company itself.\nEco‐efficiency is a management philosophy, which encourages business to search for\nenvironmental improvement while at the same time giving social and economic benefits by\nfostering innovation, growth and competitiveness. Eco‐efficiency can be viewed from many\nlevels and is basically a call to achieve more value added from resources input with reduced\nemissions and waste.\nThe adoption of sustainable reporting has become widespread among major companies\nworldwide. Over 80% of S&P 500 firms reported on sustainability in 2015, up from 20% in\n2011. Around 73% of the top 100 companies in 45 countries surveyed by KPMG also reported\non corporate responsibility. While many reference sustainability reporting guidelines, less than\nhalf have their corporate responsibility information independently verified, (Vandenbergh,\n2019). The rise in sustainable reporting is driven by increasing demand from investors and\ngovernments. By 2016, over 50 countries had regulations or policies encouraging or requiring\nsustainability reporting by organizations.\nEnergy management is crucial due to the negative environmental impacts of fossil fuels.\nAdopting low-carbon technologies and reducing dependence on energy suppliers can help\nreduce energy consumption and promote sustainable development (Tihanyi, 2016). As climate\nchange intensifies, companies are facing external pressures from regulations to reduce their\ncarbon footprint and emissions. Additionally, the increasing energy demand in developing\ncountries has led to higher energy costs and shortages, making it a pressing issue to address.\nHowever, these challenges also provide motivation for the manufacturing industry to", "word_count": 397, "start_char": 23242, "end_char": 26111}

It also reduces the impact of toxic waste on the environment,\nleading to better manufacturing flexibility and product quality. Strategies like Lean Production\ncan enhance a company's competitiveness, as it positively correlates with environmental\nperformance by reducing pollution costs and strengthening overall environmental performance\n(Pape, 2014).\n2.2 The challenges encountered in implementing sustainable consumption\nExcessive use of agrochemicals and overreliance on agriculture has rightly been pointed out as\nthe commercialization of horticulture farming, expansion of farms, and the practice of\nmonoculture favour the proliferation of pests, which in turn increases the need for pesticides.\nCurrently, due to agricultural industrialization, more and more farmers in Uganda and indeed\nglobally, are using agro-chemicals that is fertilizers and pesticides in their farms to deal with\npests and all other destructive insects as well as increasing productivity (Rau, 2014). These\nagrochemicals lead to soil degradation, increased greenhouse gas emissions, pesticide\naccumulation, and declining water availability and quality (Carragher, 2019). Additionally, the\nindiscriminate use of chemical pesticides impacts soil texture, productivity, and poses risks to\nthe environment, human health, and non-target microorganisms.\nArguably, environmental unsustainability is due to both structural features and historically\nspecific characteristics of industrial capitalism resulting in specific patterns of production and\nconsumption, as well as population growth. Poverty has often contributed to unsustainable\nproduction and consumption patterns and ultimately to environmental degradation in the\ncountry (Seyfang, 2019). The poor depend much more on nature for their livelihoods than the\nrich (Prothero, 2018) hence exhausting natural resources in the process, on top of that\nsustainability tends to come at an expense and goods usually produced sustainably are too\nexpensive for most to afford.\nFood wastage and losses at consumer and production levels as it has been noted that although\nSub-Saharan Africa faces severe food shortages, on one hand, it experiences high rates of\npostharvest loss on the other, with an estimation that about 50% of fruits and vegetables, 20%\nof cereals, pulses and legumes and 40% of roots and tubers are lost before they reach the\nconsumer (Freund ,2018). Thus, such wastage and loss not only leave the people hungry with", "word_count": 428, "start_char": 25739, "end_char": 28782}

The increase in e-waste is mostly brought about by\nexporting of e-waste to developing countries which lack technology to properly dispose of it,\nplanned obsolescence, the cost associated with repairs and ignorance, (McDonagh, 2017). With\nthis increase in e-waste, we see that there has been an increase in resource depletion, greenhouse gas emissions, soil contamination, water and air pollution.\nA survey of 2,000 Americans revealed that 61 percent believe green goods perform poorly\ncompared to traditional products, citing issues like weak cleaning supplies and underpowered\nelectric cars as well as the cost associated to green goods in comparison to traditional goods,\n(Overy, 2016). This negative perception of sustainability labels can create distrust and result in\nconsumers opting for less eco-friendly options. However, green brands have improved over\ntime and can now compete with traditional products. To address these biases, businesses should\nread reviews and select brands that meet their standards while being mindful of the\nenvironment. (Adams, 2016)\nLimited retail availability or difficulty in finding sustainable and sweatshop-free options in\nbrick and mortar and mortar retail stores is a common and serious structural barrier. The\nsustainable product assortment carried by the local Walmart, Target, or grocer is a mere\nfraction compared to traditional product shelves, ranging from apparel, cleansers, makeup, and\nproduce. As demand for earth-conscious products goes up, they are more likely to go out of\nstock at least until the corporations start to notice (Antunes, 2014). What’s more, businesses\nand consumers may have trouble locating them in the store’s layout since certain products will\nbe categorized differently from the traditional item they are replacing. Overall, the dominating\nretail environment can make it incredibly difficult and inconvenient to shop consciously,\n(Stakeholder Forum, 2013).\nSocial norms and community standards are the primary determinants of our behaviour,\nespecially when it concerns the environment. Therefore, it can be one of the biggest barriers to\novercome, (Gilmer, 2019). If one’s family, friends, or co-workers are not concerned with their\nimpact on the environment or how their purchases affect workers overseas, it can be incredibly\ntough to stick to individual goals (Byers 2019).

This applies not only to consumers but to\nbusinesses and policy makers as consumers often lack understanding of the environmental and\nsocial impacts of their consumption choices, leading to unsustainable behaviours, most\ncompanies may not be fully aware of the potential benefits, cost savings, and market\nadvantages associated with sustainable production, the lack of awareness of policymakers\nabout the urgency of sustainability issues can delay or hinder the implementation of effective\nregulations and policies. What we don’t know can hurt the planet, and the only cure for not\nknowing is reading, listening to informational podcasts, watching climate change\ndocumentaries, and reading up on favourite brands’ manufacturing processes to see if they\nalign with sustainable values (Simpson, 2020).).\nIt’s an extreme privilege to have the time, knowledge, and financial resources to practice proenvironmental production and consumption behaviours. While a growing number of\nconsumers are willing to pay a premium price for products with a moral cause, we must\nrecognize that not everyone is in a comfortable position to do so, (Phipps, 2020). Even if the\nitem’s production process is not ideal, it’s hard to refuse a bargain or store-brand item that\ndoesn’t break the bank. Financial constraints pose a significant challenge for individuals,\nbusinesses, and governments looking to adopt sustainable practices as the cost of sustainable\nproducts and services are higher than conventional alternatives, making them less accessible to\nconsumers and businesses with limited financial means (Bessant, 2016). However, the extra\nprice associated with quality and ethically-made apparel can actually pay off in the long run.\n2.3 The possible ways of ensuring sustainable production and sustainable consumption\nBalancing the use of natural resources to foster growth encourages the efficient use and\nsustainable management of natural resources. The difference between national production and\nconsumption, the policy-induced change in a country's wealth is measured by adjusted net\nsavings. This considers investment in human capital, depreciation of fixed capital, depletion of\nnatural resources, and pollution damage (Noble, 2017).

This problem is evident not only in our homes but\nespecially in catering companies that waste unconsumed food daily due to excessive production\n(Gaffney, 2017). To combat this issue, we need to encourage proper planning, inventory\nmanagement, sharing of surplus food, freezing of foodstuffs, feeding of scraps to animals,\nbeing creative with leftovers and initiatives like the Food Reform for Sustainability and Health\nproject aim to develop intelligent solutions and foster partnerships in the restaurant sector to\nsupport a healthy population and planet (Nair, 2011).\nEncourage e-waste management which aims to reduce the amount of electronic waste by\nfocusing on end-of-life practices. To minimize e-waste, we need to raise awareness of its\nimproper management in developing countries, promote the purchase of energy star rated\nelectronics from companies that encourage buy-backs, and emphasize recycling, repair, and\nrepurposing of equipment (Bengtsson, 2014). Governments should also implement export\nlimits to ensure that exported e-waste is matched with an equal quantity of recycled or reused\nmaterials in various countries as in 2019, the world generated a staggering 53.6 Mt of e-waste,\nwith Asia producing the highest amount at 24.9 Mt, followed by the Americas (13.1 Mt) and\nEurope (12 Mt), while Africa and Oceania generated 2.9 Mt and 0.7 Mt, respectively (Global\nE-waste Monitor 2020).\nDevelopment, implementation and enforcing of various strategic legal, policy, and institutional\nframeworks that promote sustainability. Uganda's commitment to green growth and sustainable\ndevelopment is evident through the 1995 Uganda constitution, the Uganda vision 2040, the\nUGGDS and recently the Switch Africa Green project which Uganda is implementing and\ncoordinating through NEMA. It is one thing to develop and implement various strategic legal,\npolicy, and institutional frameworks that promote sustainability and it is another to enforce and\nreinforce them as enforced regulations can compel businesses to integrate environmentally\nfriendly technologies, reduce pollution, and minimize waste generation.\nEnd-of-life management is crucial when it comes to enforcing sustainability as it is essential\nto make a correct management of waste to be able to protect the environment around us,\n(Wittmer, 2018). The 5 R's (Reduce, Recycle, Repurpose, Repair, and Reuse) are vital terms\nin the search for sustainability, in this case companies should adopt and align them to their\ngoals and objectives as this will help them to minimize waste, recycle materials, be creative in\nrepurposing, repair instead of replacing, and promote reusability in their products and practices.", "word_count": 475, "start_char": 33853, "end_char": 37106}

For example, using renewed interest in dry or neardry machining, using as little coolant as possible while performing metal removal or deburring, taking the burrs off of finished material after it’s been cut is another process that uses\nquite a few powerful chemicals (Kanemoto, 2021).\nOptimizing the current use of fossil fuels is a given as cutting energy cost is a win-win situation\nin today’s environment. There seems to be little argument that we are close to peak oil that is\navailability, when half of the world’s known oil reserves have been consumed. The only\nargument left is when the supply crunch will start, or if it has already begun. Save now by\nturning off machinery when it is not being used. Replace a single-speed motor with a variablespeed or servo drive to reduce energy consumption (Heavey, 2017). Also, look into alternative\nsustainable sources of energy like wind, solar, or hydroelectric power.\nRaising awareness among customers about the environmental consequences of their\nconsumption choices, such as carbon emissions, water usage, and waste generation is crucial\nin the fight for a better tomorrow. They can be educated through various forms, such as\nsustainability campaigns, labelling systems (e.g., eco-labels), and information dissemination\nthrough digital platforms, (Griggs, 2017). Some research shows that informed consumers are\nmore likely to demand sustainable products, which, in turn, encourages businesses to adopt\ngreener practices.\nGreen financing and economic incentive for example green bonds, sustainable investment\nfunds, and incentives like tax breaks, subsidies, and grants for sustainable initiatives from\ngovernments and financial institutions can provide businesses and individuals with the\nnecessary funds to invest in sustainable consumption and production hence doing away with\nthe barrier of financial constraints, (Brown, 2013).

This\nstudy used a cross-section study design using both qualitative and quantitative approaches\n(Amin, 2005). The cross-sectional approach was used because the issues of sustainable\nproduction on sustainable consumption was studied at that point in time (Amin, 2005). The\nstudy used both quantitative and qualitative approach because qualitative methods provided indepth explanations to events while quantitative methods provided the data needed to meet\nrequired objectives and to test the hypotheses (Mugenda, 1999).\n3.3 The Study Population\nMugenda and Mugenda (2003) define population as an entire group of individual or objects\nhaving common observable characteristic. The study population comprised of management\nstaff and employees from the procurement, accounting and finance departments in addition to\nthe relevant departments responsible for sustainable production on sustainable consumption\nCoca-Cola Company Namanve branch and 50 respondents helped to get the required\ninformation.\n3.4 Sample Size and Selection Technique\nAccording to (Sekaran, 2003) a sample is a subset of a population. It comprised some selected\nmembers who were referred to as elements. Sampling is the process of selecting a sufficient\nnumber of elements from the population so that a study of the sample and an understanding of\nits characteristics would make it possible to generate such characteristics to the population\nelements. The study selected up to 44 respondents based on Krejcie and Morgan Sampling\nGuidelines (see appendix III) as shown in table 1 below.\n\nTable 1: Population Category and Sample Size of the Respondents\nPopulation category\nTotal population\nSample size\nSampling Techniques\nSenior staff members\nPurposive\nEmployees\nSimple random sampling\nTotal", "word_count": 345, "start_char": 39226, "end_char": 41703}

In this study purposive sampling\ntechnique was used for senior staff members whereas Simple random sampling was used for\nthe employees because of their large number.\n3.5 Sampling Techniques\nSampling is a systematic process of selecting the number of individual cases/units to provide\ninformation needed for the study (Kombo and Tromp 2006). Thus, sampling was important in\nresearch due to the limitations in studying the whole population and reduction of both costs\nand time required since a small number of units have to be investigated (Eswaran and Singh,\n2010).\nThere are broadly two sampling approaches thus probability and none probability sampling\ntechniques. The probability sampling approach involved selecting a sample in such a way that\nall the elements in the population have some chances of being selected (Amin, 2005). This\nstudy used simple random sampling which was a sample obtained from the populations in such\na way that samples of the same size have equal chances of being selected (Amin, 2005). As\nindicated in table 1 above, the study used simple random sampling for employees. In using\nsimple random sampling, the study used the cluster approach where names in each category\nwas written on a sheet of paper and one picked at a time until the required number was reached.\nTo arrive at the sample size the study used proportionate sampling (50/44*the No in the\npopulation category).\nIn the non-probability approach, the elements in the population do not have a well-defined\nchance of being selected (Amin, 2005). This study used purposive sampling which involved\nthe researcher using own judgment or common sense regarding the participants from whom\nthe information was to be collected.

There are several\nsurvey approaches, however for the purpose of this study the questionnaire was used as\ndiscussed below.\n3.6.1 The questionnaire method.\nThe questionnaire was issued to 44 respondents at Coca-Cola Company Namanve branch. The\nrespondents noted their answers within closely defined alternatives. The aim of using this\nmethod was to get broad-based views from the respondents. The questionnaire used a 5-point\nLikert rating scale to secure the degree of the presence of the variables of interest in the study\npopulation. In cases of open-ended questions, the respondents encouraged to express\nthemselves more freely as well as provide any other information as they saw fit.\n3.7 Data Collection Instruments\n3.7.1 Self-Administered Questionnaire\nA total of 44 questionnaires was distributed to the targeted population. The study used a close\nended questionnaire for getting response from respondents. A standard Questionnaire on a fivepoint Likert scale was used to get quantifiable primary data from individual respondents on a\nscale of 5- Strongly Agree; 4- Agree; 3- Not Sure; 2- Disagree; 1- Strongly Disagree.\n3.8. Data collection procedure\nThe researcher obtained an introductory letter from the faculty of Business and administration\nof Uganda Christian University Mukono, to conduct research to Coca-Cola Company Namanve\nbranch. A letter of permission to carry out the research was obtained from Coca-Cola Company\nNamanve branch offices in order for the researcher to carry out the study. The researcher then\nobtained a document containing the names of senior staff members and employees in the\norganization. The researcher distributed questionnaires herself with the help of the office\nmessenger who knew better all the employees at the organization and 44 respondents received\nthese questionnaires.

Data was collected using questionnaires which were based on set objectives\nwhich included; assessing the factors for achieving sustainable production at Coca-Cola\nCompany Namanve branch, analysing the challenges encountered in implementing sustainable\nconsumption at Coca-Cola Company Namanve branch and suggesting possible ways of\nNamanve branch\n4.1 General characteristics of respondents.\nThe characteristics of respondents in terms of Gender (sex), Age bracket and level of education\nwere as shown below.\n4.1.1 Gender of respondents\nTable 1: showing Gender of respondents\n\nValid\nCumulative\nValid\nmale\n53.3\n53.3\n53.3\nfemale 14\n46.7\n46.7\n100.0\nTotal\n100.0\n100.0\nAccording to the table above, majority (53.3%) of the respondents were males whereas the\nminority; (46.7%) were females. This showed that there was gender imbalance in the study\nwhich was related to the willingness of the respondents to participate in the study. This however\nassisted the researcher to obtain distinct data from respondents of different sex which was\nunbiased.\n\n4.1.2 Age of respondents\nTable 2: showing Age of respondents\n\nValid\nCumulative\nValid\nbelow\nyears\n6.7\n6.7\n6.7\n20-25 years\n60.0\n60.0\n66.7\n26-30 years\n20.0\n20.0\n86.7\n31-35 years\n6.7\n6.7\n93.3\n36-40 years\n6.7\n6.7\n100.0\nTotal\n100.0\n100.0\n\nAccording to the table above, majority (60.0%) of the respondents were aged between 20-25\nyears, (20.0%) had 26-30 years whereas the minority (6.7%), (6.7%) and (6.7%) all had years\nranging from below 20 years, 31-35 years and 36-40 years respectively. This also helped the\nresearcher to obtain varying views about the study under investigation since the study involved\nrespondents with different age groups.\n4.1.3 Education level of the respondents\nTable 3: showing Education level of respondents\n\nValid Percent\nValid\nCertificate 1\n3.3\n3.3\ndiploma\n26.7\n26.7\nBachelors\n30.0\n30.0\nothers\n40.0\n40.0\n\nTotal\n100.0\n100.0\n\nAccording to the table above, majority (40.0%) of the respondents had attained other levels of\neducation, (30.0%) had attained a bachelors, (26.7%) had diploma whereas the minority;\n(1.1%) had attained a certificate level of education.

Such a full-scale transition will take considerable time; thus, given\nthe urgency and magnitude of unsustainability and the central role of consumption and\nproduction, there is a need for immediate forceful action to bring the transition in\nmotion. The SDGs, which have been in place for a good number of years, should serve\nas a catalyst to kick-start this societal transformation. This requires addressing the major\ndrivers of consumerism and overconsumption, as well as unequal consumption\nopportunities, in modern society. Dealing only with the symptoms and addressing only\nthe politically less challenging issues will not result in the kind of changes needed for\nputting our civilization on the track to sustainability. The goals and indicators of the\nSDGs, and the associated action plans for implementation, must be formulated from\nthis perspective.\nFurthermore, SCP must be coordinated with the 10YFP to ensure complementarity and\nsynergies. An immediate opportunity for such coordination is through the 10YFP UN\nInter-Agency Coordination Group. The setting of indicators and targets for both the\nSDGs and the 10YFP is a foundation for complementary operation. Together, both\nprograms would need a comprehensive set of indicators that would consolidate\nenvironmental, social and economic elements into a common framework for\nmonitoring progress.

The summary of findings is based on the literature available in chapter two. This\nchapter also provides, the conclusions, recommendations and suggested areas for further study.\n5.1 Summary of the Findings\n5.1.1 The factors for achieving sustainable production\nFrom the study finding, it was highlighted that majority of the respondents strongly agreed\nand agreed that resource efficiency not only looks to minimize waste but also reduce\nexhaustion of non-renewable resources and this was supported by (Brizga, 2014), who stated\nthat unlike past approaches, resource efficiency considers the entire lifecycle of resources,\nfocusing on waste reduction, resource conservation, and environmentally-friendly production\nprocesses. Also, the study highlighted that most of the respondents acknowledged that, eco‐\nefficiency not only aims to prevent waste and increase resource productivity but also to\nensures minimal impact towards ecology and this was similar to Chang, 2013) who said that\neco‐efficiency is a management philosophy, which encourages business to search for\nenvironmental improvement while at the same time giving social and economic benefits by\nfostering innovation, growth and competitiveness. Eco‐efficiency can be viewed from many\nlevels and is basically a call to achieve more value added from resources input with reduced\nemissions and waste. Likewise, the study indicated that incorporation of green practices into\nsupply chain management activities can enable organizations meet goals associated with\nenvironmental and social sustainability and this was in agreement with (Shaw, (2011), who\nrevealed that the increasing energy demand in developing countries has led to higher energy\ncosts and shortages, making it a pressing issue to address. However, these challenges also\nprovide motivation for the manufacturing industry to implement practices that reduce\ngreenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption. Lastly, the study stipulated that external\npressure from stakeholders, international and domestic regulations influence the adoption\nsustainable manufacturing processes and this was related to (Burja, 2009) who said that\nStakeholders play a crucial role in encouraging companies to adopt sustainable\nmanufacturing practices and engage in process and product innovation.

Likewise, the study\nfindings showed that food wastage and losses at consumer and production levels exerts undue\npressure on the lands for higher production of food to feed the ever-growing population and\nthis was in agreement with (Freund, 2018) who revealed that wastage and loss not only leave\nthe people hungry with inadequate food to consume but also exerts undue pressure on the\nlands for higher production of food to feed the ever-growing population. Likewise, the study\nfindings acknowledged that social norms and community standards are the primary\ndeterminants of our consumption behaviour, especially when it concerns the environment and\nthis was related to (Gilmer, (2019) who revealed that having a community that keeps one\naccountable is incredibly influential which is why it’s important to seek out like-minded\npeople wherever one can and with online communities brightly growing every day, it will not\nbe hard to find a squad to cheer one on.\nLastly, the study findings agreed that there is lack of awareness of consumers as to the\nimportance of sustainable consumption in communities and this was related to Sedlacko,\n(2014), who revealed that the lack of awareness of policymakers about the urgency of\nsustainability issues can delay or hinder the implementation of effective regulations and\npolicies.\n5.1.3 The possible ways of ensuring sustainable production and sustainable\nFrom the study findings, most of the respondents agreed and strongly agreed that balancing\nthe use of natural resources can foster growth and the efficient use natural resources and this\nwas related to (Noble, (2017) who acknowledged that consistently negative saving rates\nindicate diminishing wealth and unsustainable development. Positive savings form the basis\nfor future growth. More so, the study indicated that proper planning, inventory management,\nsharing of surplus food, freezing of foodstuffs, feeding of scraps to animals, being creative\nwith leftovers are some of the ways to minimize food loss and waste and this was similar to\n(Gaffney, 2017) who stressed that minimizing food loss and waste is crucial and involves\naddressing decreases in food quantity and quality at all stages of the supply chain. This\nproblem is evident not only in our homes but especially in catering companies that waste\nunconsumed food daily due to excessive production. Likewise, the study findings showed", "word_count": 570, "start_char": 69296, "end_char": 73054}

The only argument left is when the supply crunch will start, or\nif it has already begun.\nLastly, the study findings, stressed that encouraging the purchase of energy star rated\nelectronics from companies that encourage buy-backs can minimize increase of e-waste and\nthis was similar to Bengtsson. (2014) who said that to minimize e-waste, we need to raise\nawareness of its improper management in developing countries, promote the purchase of\nenergy star rated electronics from companies that encourage buy-backs, and emphasize\nrecycling, repair, and repurposing of equipment.\n5.2 Conclusion\nFrom the study findings, the factors for achieving sustainable production included; Resource\nefficiency not only looks to minimize waste but also reduce exhaustion of non-renewable\nresources, Eco‐efficiency not only aims to prevent waste and increase resource productivity\nbut also to ensures minimal impact towards ecology, Incorporation of green practices into\nsupply chain management activities can enable organizations meet goals associated with\nenvironmental and social sustainability, Adopting low-carbon technologies can help reduce\nenergy consumption and promote sustainable development, The practice of sustainability\nreporting ensures accountability, transparency and compliance, Adopting process design\nstrategies and standardization plays a crucial role in the promotion of sustainable production\nand external pressure from stakeholders, international and domestic regulations to influence\nthe adoption sustainable manufacturing processes.\nAlso the study findings highlighted that the challenges encountered in implementing\nsustainable consumption included; There is application of excessive fertilizers and pesticides\nto improve crop production that has negative environmental implications, Lack of e-waste\nmanagement has led to an increase in resource depletion, green-house gas emissions, soil\ncontamination, water and air pollution, Food wastage and losses at consumer and production\nlevels exerts undue pressure on the lands for higher production of food to feed the ever-growing\npopulation, The negative perception of sustainability labels can create distrust and result in\nconsumers opting for less eco-friendly options, There is limited retail of green products which\nmakes it incredibly difficult and inconvenient to shop consciously, Social norms and\ncommunity standards are the primary determinants of our consumption behaviour, especially\nwhen it concerns the environment, Green products are usually more expensive compared to\ntraditional products and this limits consumers from purchasing sustainable products and there", "word_count": 440, "start_char": 72874, "end_char": 75997}

The current financing modes in Uganda are not favourable. The interest rates\ncharged by commercial banks in Uganda are exorbitant and as a result, this has made it very\ndifficult for manufacturing firms like Coca-Cola Company to invest in new and up-to-date\nmanufacturing technologies.\nManagement of Coca-Cola company should Carry out Cleaner Production Assessments and\nprepare industry specific Environmental Management Plans; develop a code of conduct that\ncould be abided by the industry and promote labelling and recognition mechanisms that\nrecognises continuous improvements by the manufacturing industry; promote lifecycle\nassessments in the sector. This in turn may enhance efficiency of resource consumption in the\nmanufacturing subsector while minimizing adverse environmental impacts and thus increase\nproductivity.\nThere is need for strengthening awareness creation and trainings in the areas of waste\nmanagement like the application of circular models where waste is used as an input as opposed\nto the current traditional linear model of take make and waste which being applied in most\nmanufacturing firms of Uganda. Knowledge generation through research should go hand in\nhand with strategies to create the capacity to apply and roll out new knowledge to promote the\nimplementation of sustainability practices.\n\n5.4 Areas for further study\nTransforming systems of consumption and production for achieving the sustainable\ndevelopment goals.\nMaking Sustainable Consumption and Production the Core of Sustainable Development Goals.", "word_count": 405, "start_char": 75997, "end_char": 78834}
