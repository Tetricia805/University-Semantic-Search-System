Funding for health care has over the time become a\ncollective responsibility because of the importance of the facility and the rising costs of health\nservices. The Ugandan government has spent over UGX 4,179.2 billion2 down from the UGX\n4,739.1 billion approved for FY 2022/23 (Wasswa, J. H., Oundo, H., Oteba, M. O 04, 2023)The\ncuts in the health budget have affected a number of critical sectors of health insurance mostly the\ngovernment underwritten ones. Despite all that government has come up with a number of\nfactors to increase a number of people under taking health insurance.\nOver the last 20 years, the private health sector in Uganda has grown significantly. Any\nmeaningful strategy to improve health outcomes in Uganda must look beyond the public sector\nand consider the potential of the not-for-profit and the for-profit (commercial) health sector. The\ncurrent Government of Uganda understands this, and the private sector is very much a part of\ntheir Vision 2030 plan for growth in all areas, including health insurance sector.\nDespite all offers put in by the government and the private sector to improve health insurance\nuptake there is still a gap that needs to be covered and this is seen among university students as\nmany have no health insurance coverage.\nThis chapter therefore talks about the perception of health insurance uptake among university\nstudents, this focuses on the significance of the topic of study, the background study of the topic\nthat describes what literature has already been said about the perception of health insurance\nuptake among university students, the statement problem was made to ensure that a specific\nproblem is defined. Objectives were set accordingly and hence creation of the research question\nto be answered, In this very chapter the justification of the topic was generated identifying the\ngaps that the study intends on solving, and it is in this very chapter were the scope of study and\nthe limitation were stated to show how the research was conducted, when, where and for what", "word_count": 394, "start_char": 14142, "end_char": 16530}

This has helped us to\nunderstand the factors affecting the uptake of health insurance among the students today.\n1.2 Background study\nAccording to Lieberthal, R. D. (2016). Health insurance can be thought of mainly as a form of\nhealthcare finance, the mechanism by which people pay for healthcare. The majority of\nhealthcare payments come well after the time that services are rendered, and payments come\nmainly from third parties. Like any economic service, there is a market for healthcare finance\nwith a demand side and a supply side. Unlike many services that are purchased on credit,\nhealthcare is a highly subjective product owing to the subjective nature of health. Health\ninsurance is also known as medical. (Julia Kagan, August 06, 2023) also defined health\ninsurance as when a corporation and a customer enter into a contract for health insurance. In\nexchange for the payment of a monthly premium, the corporation offers to cover all or part of the\ninsured person's medical expenses.\nThe contract, which is typically for a year, outlines the precise costs linked to disease, injury,\npregnancy, or preventative treatment that the insurance will be liable for covering.\nMedical or health insurance covers all medical and surgical costs paid by covered members as a\nresult of their contracting an illness, disease, or suffering an unintentional physical injury during\nthe insurance period; The health insurance policy can either pay the healthcare provider directly\nor reimburse the insured for any out-of-pocket expenses; Health insurance helps one’s mind to be\nat ease as a result, it gives access to the top medical centers, encourages a saving culture and\nraises welfare, the resources and tools for health and wellness are made available to insured\npeople and for group policies, it establishes a \"Employer of Choice\" situation that boosts\nemployee productivity and reduces absenteeism.\nJust like any other developing country Uganda has adopted the use of health insurance and\naccording to Monitor newspaper April 18, 2023 the health insurance uptake in Uganda has\ngrown with its users growing to Shs245b in comparison to when it had just started in 1996. A\nnumber of participants have entered in to this game and have ensued the awareness and\nimportance of health insurance to the people of Uganda.", "word_count": 385, "start_char": 16530, "end_char": 18911}

Although the Ugandan government has taken\nsteps to increase healthcare access and affordability, there is a dearth of detailed information on\nhow the university students perceive and use health insurance. The issue at hand centers on\ncomprehending the variables affecting how university students in Uganda now perceive health\ninsurance and the obstacles preventing their adoption. Despite the potential advantages of health\ninsurance, including better access to medical facilities, financial security from unanticipated\nmedical costs, and enhanced health outcomes, a sizable portion of students lack coverage.\nWhereas it is being embraced by some people, insurance uptake in Uganda is generally still low\nsays; (Bandese Walala 2019). The main reasons for this are economic factors and ignorance of\nhow insurance works, with the latter forcing some to opt for out-of-pocket payments (Kasemiire,\n2018). Individuals incur heavy costs when it comes to medical care and in most cases these costs\nare unexpected. Since majority of Ugandans lack health insurance while some do not know what\nhealth insurance is or how it works, this means that in case of illnesses requiring medical\nattention they fall into debt in some cases and their lifestyle is greatly affected (Kasemiire,\n2018). University Students are among those who should purchase health insurance to protect\nthemselves from financial damage as over 275,254 students join the universities every year, due\nto that fact they have a higher than average chance of developing health issues as a result of a\nchange in lifestyle from their earlier years. Because of the strain associated with their studies,\nthey are also susceptible to stress, which might result in various illnesses.Students at universities\nhave access to a variety of dining options, some of which are unhealthy. Some students also\nreside in dormitories away from the campus, some of which are situated in dusty areas and may\ncause health issues. Due to all of these dangers, if a student becomes ill without health insurance,\nthey will be forced to pay out-of-pocket, which can occasionally result in debt.

There is currently\na great number of published studies on this study but however the finding of this study therefore\nwill provide a valuable reference to the health insurance community and body of knowledge as\nto if Health insurance knowledge among adolescents is low as far as the perception of health\ninsurance uptake among students is concerned.\n1.8 Scope of study\nThe main aim of this study is to determine the perception of health insurance uptake among\nuniversity students. The study will consider most preferable the BBA students of Uganda\nChristian University, excluding non-students. He participants will be interviewed through the use\nof questionnaires. A time period of about 10 minutes will be given to each student to create a\nmore comfortable space for the student in order for the researcher to get their points of view.\nHowever, the assumption is that the student will be open to this since there is nothing to fear and\nthey are not under any kind of pressure.\n1.8.1 Geographical Scope\nThis research seeks to investigate the factors that determine uptake among BBA students of\nUganda Christian University from 3:3 to 2: 1.\n1.8.2 Time Scope\nThe study is limited and will only be carried out within Uganda Christian University Our\ngeographical scope shall be Uganda Christian University, located Mukono for a period of 2\nweeks.\n\n1.8.3 Population Scope\nThe research shall seek to study BBA students at Uganda Christian University, one of the largest\nprivate institution of higher education in Uganda. The study shall mainly target undergraduate\nstudents studying at the university.\n1.9 Limitation\nDue to the nature of the research questions, when carrying out the research, the following factors\nwill hinder data collection: the students may limit the generation of data, resulting in inadequate\nresults since there is historical data pertaining to material specifications. Using questionnaires\nmay make it possible to reach a larger number of students, but they may lack the ability to\nprovide detailed context or explanations for respondents' answers. This can make it challenging\nto interpret their responses accurately or fully understand the underlying reasons behind their\nanswers.\n1.10 Conceptual model; (Gichuru, K.

These components interact to shape the perception of health\ninsurance among university students.\nAwareness levels\nAttitude\nGender\nIncome levels\nUptake of health insurance\n\nAwareness Levels: This component focuses on assessing the awareness levels among students\nregarding health insurance options available to them. It includes variables such as knowledge\nabout different types of health insurance plans, understanding of coverage benefits, familiarity\nwith insurance providers, and awareness of the enrollment process. The objective is to determine\nhow informed students are about health insurance options.\nCost: The cost factor refers to the financial implications of obtaining insurance. This includes\nthe premium amount that students need to pay to be covered by an insurance plan. The\nrelationship between cost and insurance uptake can be both direct and inverse. As the cost of\ninsurance increases, the likelihood of insurance uptake may decrease. Higher insurance\npremiums might deter financially constrained students from obtaining insurance coverage.\nConversely, if insurance plans are offered at a more affordable rate or with subsidies, the\nlikelihood of students opting for insurance may increase. Lowering the financial barrier makes\ninsurance more accessible and attractive.\nAttitudes: Attitudes refer to the beliefs, opinions, and perceptions that individuals have towards\ninsurance. Positive attitudes can encourage insurance uptake, while negative attitudes can\ndiscourage it. If students perceive insurance as a valuable protection against unexpected medical\nexpenses or other risks, they are more likely to enroll. Positive attitudes can arise from awareness\ncampaigns, understanding the benefits of insurance, and personal experiences of needing\ncoverage. Negative perceptions, such as thinking insurance is unnecessary, confusing, or a waste\nof money, might lead to lower uptake. Misinformation or lack of education about insurance\ncould contribute to negative attitudes.\nGender: Gender plays a role in shaping individuals' behaviors and decisions, including\ninsurance. Depending on cultural norms, societal expectations, and personal experiences, gender\ncould impact insurance uptake. For example, if one gender is generally more risk-averse or more\nhealth-conscious, it might influence their likelihood of obtaining insurance. In some cases,\ngender might not directly influence insurance uptake. Students of all genders could make\ndecisions based on factors other than their gender.", "word_count": 431, "start_char": 25018, "end_char": 28076}

In order for me\nas the researcher to address the research problem, understanding of the theoretical dynamics of\nhealth insurance uptake among students was necessary. This chapter gives the theoretical review\nand literature related to the respective objective in my study.\nFirst, health insurance uptake is defined in this chapter and its antecedents and constructs are\nexplored, after which perception and the nature and essence of perception and its link to health\ninsurance uptake are assessed.\n2.2 Overview Health Insurance\nThe main purpose of insurance is to mitigate risk, i.e., to transfer risk from one party, the\ninsured, to the insurer; this does not mean that the loss is prevented from happening, but it does\ngive the insured some measure of financial security and peace of mind; the major financial risk\nthat an individual may face, such as getting into an accident and needing surgery, is transferred\nto the health insurer and replaced by a smaller known financial risk, such as the cost of the\nsurgery; and the replacement risk is paid for by the money.\nGetting health insurance is a crucial responsibility for adolescents making the transition to early\nadulthood (Charlene A. Wong et al., 2015). Health insurance is a sort of insurance that spreads\nthe risk of a person needing medical expenses among a large number of people. It may cover all\nor part of the risk. It includes coverage for losses resulting from mishaps, medical bills,\ndisabilities, or unintentional death and limb loss. A health insurance policy is a legal agreement\nbetween a person and an insurance company. The individual can be an employer or a local\ngroup, and the insurance provider can be the government or an insurance firm. In the case of\nprivate contracts, the term may be renewed annually, monthly, or even indefinitely.", "word_count": 390, "start_char": 27660, "end_char": 30114}

In the context of health insurance uptake among students, this\nframework could explore how students perceive their susceptibility to health issues, their\nperceived severity, the perceived benefits of having insurance, and the barriers they face in\nobtaining coverage.\n2.3.2 Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB)\nThe Theory of Planned Behavior posits that people's intentions and behaviors are determined by\nthree main factors: attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control. Attitudes refer\nto an individual's positive or negative evaluation of a behavior (e.g., getting health insurance).\nSubjective norms involve the influence of social pressure and the perception of what others think\nabout the behavior. Perceived behavioral control relates to an individual's belief in their ability to\nperform the behavior. Applying this framework to the perception of health insurance uptake\namong students would involve examining students' attitudes towards insurance, the influence of\ntheir social environment, and their perceived control over obtaining coverage.\n2.3.3 Social Cognitive Theory (SCT)\nSocial Cognitive Theory emphasizes the interaction between personal factors, environmental\nfactors, and behaviors. It suggests that individuals' behaviors are influenced by their self-efficacy\n(belief in their ability to perform the behavior), observational learning (learning from others'", "word_count": 316, "start_char": 29803, "end_char": 32027}
{"chunk_id": "DOC0075__00011", "doc_id": "DOC0075", "chunk_index": 11, "text": "t suggests that individuals' behaviors are influenced by their self-efficacy\n(belief in their ability to perform the behavior), observational learning (learning from others'\n\nexperiences), and outcome expectations (anticipated consequences of the behavior). When\napplied to the perception of health insurance uptake among students, this framework would\nconsider how students' self-efficacy, observations of others obtaining insurance, and expectations\nregarding the benefits and costs of insurance influence their decision-making.\n2.3.4 Diffusion of Innovations Theory\nThe Diffusion of Innovations Theory explores the process through which new ideas, products, or\nbehaviors spread among individuals and groups. It suggests that the adoption of an innovation (in\nthis case, health insurance uptake) is influenced by the characteristics of the innovation itself, the\ncommunication channels through which information is spread, the social system within which\nindividuals interact, and the individual's readiness to adopt the innovation. Applying this\nframework to health insurance uptake among students would involve examining how\ncharacteristics of insurance plans, communication strategies, social networks, and individual\nreadiness influence students' perception and decision to obtain coverage.\n2.4 Gap in Literature\nYoung adult’s viewpoints on health insurance are crucial. Their preferences for health insurance\ncan help improve engagement and expand coverage in this community (Charlene A. Wong et al.,\n2015). The uptake of health insurance among adolescents in particular deserves special attention,\neven though earlier research offers useful data on the topic generally. Investigating the situations\nand conditions under which university students get health insurance may therefore be helpful in\norder to learn about their preferences for health insurance.\n\nCHAPTER THREE\nMETHODOLOGY\n3.1 Introduction\nThis chapter describes the methodology that will be used in the design of this study. This chapter\naddresses issues concerned with the research design, the study population, the sampling method\nand the data collection that will be used as well as the data analysis method.\n3.2 Research Design\nThe study's survey design will be cross-sectional. Data from a population or a representative\nsubset are observed in cross-sectional research at a certain time. By interviewing a sample of\nchosen BBA students at Uganda Christian University Mukono, this study will determine how\nhealth insurance is perceived and used by college students.\n3.3 Study Population\nAll of the students that share the trait we're interested in are included in the study population.\nThe study's target population is BBA students at Uganda Christian University at the time of the\nstudy. It is believed that the students who will participated in the survey would do so voluntarily.\nThe students who will take part in the survey will do so voluntarily.\n3.4 Population Size.\nBBA UCU\nPopulation\nBBA 3:2\nBBA 3:1\nBBA 2:2\nBBA 2:1\nTotal", "word_count": 437, "start_char": 31854, "end_char": 34856}

Data is collected from a\nselected sample of students studying at Uganda Christian University using a questionnaire.\n3.5.2 Sampling Design\nIn this research, probability sampling is used meaning selection is random. A two-stage sampling\ndesign is used where the population is first divided into strata (subpopulations), namely male and\nfemale, from which simple random sampling (without replacement) is used to achieve the\ndesired sample of students from each stratum.\n3.5.3 Sample Size Determination\nTo have confidence in the survey results, the sample must be representative of the study\npopulation in terms of selection procedure and number. The total number of students chosen for\nthe study will be determined by Cochran’s formula (1963). This formula is used for an infinite\npopulation, that is to say, one that is too large or unknown. The formula is shown below:\nn – Total sample size selected\nz – The standard z-statistic of the normal distribution\np – Degree of variability\nq – (1-p)\ne – Margin error\nWe shall set p=0.5 implying q=0.5\nThe following values were also assumed:", "word_count": 255, "start_char": 34614, "end_char": 36169}

The\nquestionnaires will comprise both closed-ended and open-ended questions aimed at collecting\ninformation from the respondents on the different factors affecting their uptake of health\ninsurance. The questionnaire is first piloted by asking a few students to read through it and see if\nthere are any ambiguities which the researcher may not have included.\n3.6.1 Data Collection Instrument\nThe researcher will use a questionnaire to collect. The quantitative questionnaire used will\nconsist of 17 questions in total. There will be one open ended question, which is question 2\nasking for the respondent’s age. The rest of the questions will be closed ended, most of which are\nYes/No type of questions.\n3.6.2 Reliability and Validity\nReliability was ensured by paying more emphasis on the BBA 3:2 who are expected to have\nmore reliable information. The validity of the data was ensured by collecting primary data\nthrough the use of questionnaires.\n3.6.3 Data Collection Procedure\nThe researcher requested for an introductory letter from Uganda Christian University, which\nletter was presented to the different class coordinator. The researcher went on to explain what the\nresearch is all about, why the research population was chosen and the benefit of the case study.\nFollowing, the researcher sought permission to request participate fill in questionnaires, putting\ninto consideration a high level of confidentiality.", "word_count": 295, "start_char": 35929, "end_char": 37805}

Univariate analysis was\ncarried out which included frequency analysis of each variable.\n3.8 Ethical Consideration\nEthical considerations were taken into consideration by first; requesting for an introductory letter\nfrom UCU and then Questionnaires were structured. The respondents were given clear\nexplanations on the objectives and details of the study as well as its benefits. Those who agreed\nto take part in the study were assured of confidentiality with regard to any information they\nprovide. The respondents’ identities remained anonymous and undisclosed at every point in the\nstudy. The researcher also made them aware that they were allowed to refuse to take part in the\nsurvey in case they felt uncomfortable taking part. This research was self-sponsored and there\nwas no form of compensation for participants of the research. This ensured that the responses\nfrom the participants were not biased on account of hope for remuneration.\n.\n\nCHAPTER FOUR\n4.1 Introduction\nThis chapter presents the results obtained from the Univariate analysis and interpretation of data\ncollected from the study, based on the research questions guiding the study.\n4.2 Univariate Analysis\nThe study targeted university students to get their responses on factors affecting uptake of health\ninsurance. This section analyses the information collected from the respondents.\n4.3 Demographic characteristics of respondents\nThis section presents respondents’ general background information. The components include the\nresponse level, gender, attitude, income levels, and awareness levels.\nResponse Level.\nThe response rate shows the percentage of the target population that responded to the study\nagainst the percentage of those that did not respond this presents the response level of the\nstudents to the study.

This means that\nthese independent variables do not explain the variation in the dependent variable thus making\nthem insignificant.\nHowever, parent/guardian having health insurance has a higher effect on the uptake of health\ninsurance by university student meaning there is a statistically significant relationship between a\nparent having health insurance and the student having health insurance. As seen above, it is\nnoted that some of the independent variables did not return results. This may be because the\nrespondents may who do not know anyone with health insurance are among those who do not\nhave health insurance. This means that basing on the results obtained, it may not be possible to\nhave health insurance and not know anyone with health insurance. Likewise, those students who\ndo not know any companies or financial institutions offering health insurance may be part of\nthose students who do not have health insurance. This also means that basing on the results\nobtained, a student cannot have health insurance and not know any companies or financial\ninstitutions that offer health insurance.\n\n76.50%\n23.50%\nRespondents that have had to pay from out of pocket.\nYes\nNo", "word_count": 404, "start_char": 44300, "end_char": 46780}

Only 20% of the respondents had health insurance. Nonetheless, a large\nproportion of the respondents 88.2% felt that health insurance is necessary. Only 11.8%% of the\nrespondents felt that health insurance is not necessary. While the respondents 64.7% agreed that\nhealth insurance should be made mandatory for university students during admission and 55.3%\nof the respondents felt that health insurance should not be made mandatory for university\nstudents during admission.\n5.3 Conclusions\nAccording to the research findings obtained, it is concluded that a parent/guardian having health\ninsurance is the only variable with a significant effect on the student taking up health insurance,\nafter obtaining a percentage of 82.4% which is less than 17. 6%. An odds ratio of 13.75 was\nobtained in the multivariate analysis. This implies that a university student who has a\nparent/guardian who has health insurance will be 13.75 times more likely to have health\ninsurance than a university student who has a parent/guardian who does not have health\nAccording to the results obtained, the following hypotheses were supported:\n• Students’ gender has no effect on uptake of health insurance.\n• Students’ residence has no influence on uptake of health insurance.\n• A history of a serious health problem in the family has no effect on uptake of health", "word_count": 308, "start_char": 46532, "end_char": 48491}
{"chunk_id": "DOC0075__00019", "doc_id": "DOC0075", "chunk_index": 19, "text": "• A student opting for out-of-pocket payments before has no influence on uptake of health\n• According to the results obtained, the following hypothesis was not supported:\n• A parent/guardian having health insurance has no influence on the student’s uptake of\nhealth insurance.\n5.4 Recommendations\nFrom the observations made in this study, it can be seen that majority of the students do not have\nhealth insurance. Even though most of the students do not have health insurance, majority of\nthem agree that health insurance is necessary and also majority of the students agree that health\ninsurance should be made mandatory for university students during admission to the university.\nMost of the students who have health insurance do so because their parents also have health\ninsurance. Most of the students who do not have health insurance cited financial reasons as the\nmain barrier to them acquiring the insurance. Another major reason for lack of health insurance\nwas ignorance about how insurance works. Others did not know where to access health insurance\nfrom. There is growing need to improve and increase sensitization among students about health\ninsurance and all related benefits. University students are vulnerable to different illnesses and are\nexposed to a number of health risks so health insurance should be given high priority. The\nfindings of this study have given more insight into health insurance among university students.\nThe researcher recommends increased sensitization among parents with adolescent children\nabout health insurance and all related benefits. This is important since the findings from the\ninvestigation show that a student is more likely to have health insurance if the student’s\nparent/guardian has health insurance too. This implies increasing sensitization among the parents\nwill in turn increase the chances of the students having health insurance.\n5.5 Limitations to the study.\nSome respondents are lazy readers and found it hard to go through the whole questionnaire. This\nchallenge was solved by reading and interpreting the instructions and questions for the\nrespondents. There was a low level of response rate due to the busy schedules of many of the\nstudents and lack of interest of some of them. There was also a bias attitude in self-reported\nanswers and difficulty in accurate and honest response. It was also challenging to come up with a\nwell-structured questionnaire that contains all the desired information while minimizing the\nrespondent’s fatigue.", "word_count": 391, "start_char": 48491, "end_char": 50996}
