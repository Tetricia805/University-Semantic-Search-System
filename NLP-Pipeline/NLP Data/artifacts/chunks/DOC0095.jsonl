As a result of significant and\ncontinuous increasing financial expense, limiting the effective and suitable\nmanagement of its potable resources.to address the problem, the university must\nadopt an alternative water source capable of serving the non-potable appliances\nGlobally, many institutions facing similar challenges have successfully implemented\nwastewater reuse system (PUB, 2014). The approach involves treated wastewater\nto acceptable standards for non-potable uses such as toilet flushing, landscape\nirrigation and industrial cooling of equipment.

The\ninitial stage is the treatment of the wastewater effluent to meet non-potable\nwater quality standards for toilet flushing. This is to reduce the risk human\ncontamination and user acceptance of the project. This can reduce the demand for\npotable water in a community (Pandey, 2022). When wastewater effluent is\nincorporated into waste management, there is a closed loop in which water is\ntransformed from a discharged waste into a precious resource.\n2.1.1 Physicochemical and Bacteriological Characteristics Ucu Wastewater\nEffluent\nUcu Effluent Quality\nEffluent quality refers to the chemical, physical, and biological characteristics of\nthe effluent generated by the UCU wastewater treatment plant in regards to the\nintended use. For water to be acceptable for use by the population, there must be\nno risk of disease contraction by the users and an aesthetically acceptable outlook\nof the reused water.\nA total of six water quality parameters were selected for this study (PUB, 2014).\nThey include:", "word_count": 235, "start_char": 17384, "end_char": 18913}

Filtration is type of treatment widely used to reduce turbidity of water.\nin this process, the wastewater effluent is passed through the porous medium to\nremove particulate matter (J. Shanthi Sravan, Leonidas Matsakas and Sarkar,\n2024). Membrane technologies used include; microfiltration and ultrafiltration\nwhich are used for advanced wastewater treatment because they are effective in\nremoving micron sized particles.\n, preventing salt water (seawater) contamination and augmenting the region’s\ndrinking water supply. Another technology widely used in wastewater filtration is\nsand filtration. Larger suspended particles like silt are physically trapped in the\nspaces or pores between the sand grains as wastewater trickles through sand\nlayers. In addition, through the process of adsorption, small colloidal particles that\npass through the sand’s pore spaces are trapped by adhesion on the surface of the\nsand grains.\na) Color.\nColor is an important physical parameter that informs about the wastewater\neffluent composition, condition, and potential contaminants therein.\nIn the treatment of wastewater effluent, chemical methods of treatment are often\nemployed. The coagulation and flocculation processes are widely employed\nbecause they are highly effective in the decolorization of water (Ho, Chua and\nChong, 2020). This involves the addition of chemical coagulants to destabilize the\nsuspended particles and colored compounds in the wastewater effluent.", "word_count": 268, "start_char": 18645, "end_char": 20479}

This is\nbecause extreme pH values are fatal to both aquatic life and cause damage to the\npiping and plumbing systems in place aimed towards the reuse of effluent (El-\nKhateeb, Nashy and Nayl, 2020).\nThe fundamental principal in pH correction is the addition of an acidic or basic\nchemical to adjust the pH of the wastewater effluent to a neutral range. For\nexample, between 6.0 – 9.0.\nb) Total coliforms\nTotal coliforms are a group of bacteria that are no exactly harmful, however their\npresence in wastewater effluent indicates the presence of certain disease-causing\nmicroorganisms. Total coliforms are found in all parts of the environment such as\nthe soil, in vegetation, and in the guts of warm-blooded animals (Solomon\nOluwaseun Akinnawo, Peter Odunayo Ayadi and Mathew Temitope Oluwalope,\n2023).\nChlorine is widely used as a disinfectant because it disrupts the microbial cell\nmembranes and inactive enzymes crucial for cell survival of the bacteria. The\neffectiveness of the chlorination by chlorine depends largely on the chlorine\ndosage, contact time, pH, and the presence of other interfering substances.\nc) Escherichia coli (E. coli)\nE. Coli is a common bacterium found in the intestines or gut of warm-blooded\nanimals, including humans.

Coli and other pathogens can also be treated using chemical disinfection with\nchlorine disinfection being one of the most used methods. Another method is\nozonation where ozone, a powerful oxidant and disinfectant is used to inactivate\nmicroorganisms. In some cases, ozonation is preferred because of its ability to\ndisinfect without forming harmful disinfection byproducts (Solomon Oluwaseun\nAkinnawo, Peter Odunayo Ayadi and Mathew Temitope Oluwalope, 2023).\nd) BOD5\nBiochemical oxygen demand over 5 days is an important parameter to determine\nthe quality of the wastewater effluent. The concentration of BOD5 in water is\nindicative of the level of organic pollution present in the water. It is used to\nquantify the amount of dissolved oxygen consumed in the decomposition of organic\nmatter by microorganisms (Maddah, 2022). Presence in organic pollutants in\nwastewater effluent increases the risk to human health if this effluent is reused\nfor toilet flushing.\n2.1.2 Case Studies of Implemented Wastewater Effluent Reuse Systems\nWater Factory 21, Orange County California\nWater factory 21 is a large-scale ground water recharging facility located in\nFountain Valley, Orange County California.

The solution employed is the use\nof municipal sewage effluent generated by approximately 2.5 million residents to\nrecharge the groundwater aquifers. The first objective was to treat the secondary\neffluent to a high quality for injection in to the ground (OCWD, 2018).\nA tertiary treatment train was used to treat the secondary effluent which involved\nlime clarification, carbon adsorption, reverse osmosis, and chlorination as a multibarrier treatment train. This treatment was focused on meeting drinking water\nquality standards. Injection wells were used to deliver the highly treated water\ninto the aquifer, which then served as a natural storage and distribution reservoir\nResults showed that the Water Factory 21 provided a high-quality Groundwater\nReplenishment System, a supply system that can trace contaminants, and longterm water security in a semi-arid region.\n2.1.3 Sembcorp NEWater plants, Singapore\nThe Sembcorp NEWater plant is the world’s largest water reclamation plant\noperated by the Public Utilities Board of Singapore. It has a capacity of 228,000\ncubic meters per day. The challenge of water scarcity and national security have\nbeen vital in the driving of Singapore’s NEWater program which has been a vital\ninitiative ever since its establishment because the country previously relied on\nimported water. Therefore, to diversify the nation’s water supply the scheme\nbegan to treat secondary effluent generated from the comprehensive sewerage\nnetwork of the Island known as the Deep Tunnel Sewerage System (PUB, 2018).

After the characterization of\nthe wastewater effluent to be reused, the data collected was used to identify\nworst case loads, typical loads, seasonal loads, and shock loads. This enabled PUB\nto clearly define the feedwater quality. Afterwards, the boards used removal\nperformance data for the candidate treatment technologies of interest (membrane\nfiltration, reverse osmosis, ultraviolet disinfection, and advanced oxidation) which\nthey often obtained from pilot plants, such as the 2000 full-scale demonstration\nplant which would establish the suitable treatment train to achieve their desired\nwater quality. To set the target water quality, PUB referenced WHO and the US EPA\nto attain high water quality standards. The board created mass balance and\nremoval requirements for each contaminant as well as calculated log reductions\nthat the treatment process must achieve to produce the desired water quality of\nthe effluent.\nInformed by the pilot and baseline data, PUB selected the three-stage treatment\ntrain for NEWater mentioned above.\nArizona State University (ASU) Tempe Campus, USA\nThe Tempe Campus once faced the problem of heavy reliance on municipal water\nsources for non-potable applications which resulted in high operational costs and\nthe need for water independence in an arid climate.

The treatment\nmethods used are typically sand filtration and chlorination to meet the strict\nhealth standards for non-potable uses. The distribution system employed consists\nof color-coded pipe networks (purple pipes) constructed within the campus\ngrounds to distribute the treated wastewater effluent to large landscaping\nirrigation systems, athletic fields and most importantly, toilet and urinal flushing in\nacademic buildings.\nCoastal Metropolitan Area Schemes - Catalonia Spain\nA Barcelona coastal metropolitan reuse scheme was developed to address seasonal\nwater scarcity. In addition, they were also developed to reduce pressure on surface\nwater and groundwater sources and to prevent seawater intrusion in the LIobregat\ndelta aquifer. The scheme sources secondary effluent from the metropolitan\nwastewater treatment plants. The end uses of the effluent include agricultural\nirrigation, wetland restoration and the prevention of seawater intrusion through a\nbarrier.\nTo meet district end-use water quality standards, the schemes use a four-stage\ntreatment system. That is to say, filtration, advanced biological and chemical\ntreatment, and finally disinfection. For the distribution system, bulk conveyance\npipelines, pumping stations, and reservoirs designed to meet seasonal peak\ndemands as well as the need to meet the intrusion barrier (Mujeriego et al., 2008).\n\nFigure 2: A Reclaimed water pumping station for instream flow and agricultural\nirrigation (Mujeriego et al., 2008).\nTreatment Of Wastewater Effluent to Meet Non-Potable Water Quality\nThe tested parameters that did not meet the Singapore PUB guideline quality for\nnon-potable water for toilet and urinal flushing are, turbidity, E.

This chapter serves to provide an academic and scientific\nrationale for selecting key parameters to determine the physical, chemical, and\nbiological parameters for the quality assessment of UCU’s effluent which is\nintended to be reused for toilet flushing. The selected parameters are relevant to\nguaranteeing the safety, aesthetic acceptability, and long-term viability of a water\nreusing system. The selection is justified by their impact on human health, system\nlongevity, and user acceptance.\nThere is no single, universal standard for non-potable water quality for flushing\ntoilets. Instead, the standards for water reuse vary widely from country to country\nand are regulated by a \"fit-for-purpose\" approach, i.e., water quality is managed\nto be safe to use and to pose no hazard to public health and the environment.\nGiven that this research is taking place in Uganda, a country that experiences\ntropical climate and tropical weather patterns, the Singapore non-potable water\nstandards for toilet and urinal flushing will be used to ensure the treated effluent\nmeets public health standards for Uganda’s climatic conditions.

Once the quality of the effluent meets\nthe target parameters for non- potable reuse, a dual-pipe water system will be\ninstalled to supply the recycled water for flushing toilets, urinals and for irrigation.\n(Mosher, 2015).\nAccording to Mosher (2015) design requirements, a separate reclaimed water\ndistribution network should be developed to avoided cross contamination between\npotable water and non-potable water. The reused water will be conveyed from the\nclean water tank through outlet into a dedicated storage tank sized to hold a\nvolume equivalent to at least 1.5 days of flushing demand.

A monitoring plan should encourage so that the treated water is in\nline with non- potable reuse standards taking a priority on parameters such as\nBOD, TSS coliforms, and turbidity.
