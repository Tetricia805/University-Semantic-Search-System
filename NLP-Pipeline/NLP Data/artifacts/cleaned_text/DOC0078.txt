ABSTRACT
This experiment aimed to assess the effectiveness of garlic extract and rabbit urine concoction as a natural
aphid control agent on infested tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum). The study investigated the impact
of different doses of garlic extract on plant height, leaf damage, Number of aphids and Number of flowers
at the flowering stage. The garlic extract was prepared by crushing garlic bulbs and sieved to achieve the
desired concentrations after mixing it with the desired concentrations of rabbit urine. The experiment
employed a randomized complete block design with four treatment groups each replicated three times:
a control group (0%), low dose (10%), medium dose (30%), and high dose (50%) of the mixture
concentration of rabbit urine and garlic extract concoction. The treatments were applied using a handheld
sprayer, and the plants were monitored for aphid populations using visual inspection. Data collected were
subjected to statistical analysis, including analysis of variance (ANOVA), to determine significant
differences between treatments. The results revealed that higher doses of garlic extract and rabbit Urine
concoction led to increased plant height, decrease in leaf damage caused by aphids, , and reduced number
of aphids as well as increased number of flowers. The control group exhibited the lowest values for all
parameters, while treatments with garlic extract and rabbit urine concoction showed significant
improvements. The highest yields were observed in Treatment 50%, where plants treated with the highest
dose of garlic extract and rabbit urine concoction had the highest plantt height, least number leaves
damaged by aphids and highest number of flowers at flowering stage. These findings demonstrate the
potential of garlic extract and rabbit urine concoction as an effective aphid control agent, capable of
enhancing tomato crop health and growth and economic returns for farmers.

CHAPTER ONE
1.0 Introduction
This chapter comprises of the background of the study of the topic, problem statement, main
objective, specific objectives, hypothesis, justification, significance and scope of the study.
The tomato, Lycopersicon esculentum L., is a widely favored vegetable for home gardens and
ranks as the second most commonly consumed vegetable globally, right after potatoes (Solanum
tuberosum L.). Originally hailing from South America, particularly Peru and Ecuador, the tomato
was first cultivated and domesticated in Mexico (Benton, 2007). During the middle of the 16th
century, the tomato made its way to Europe. It was mainly showcased in early herbals for its visual
appeal, but it wasn't commonly consumed, except in Italy and Spain. In fact, many people believed
the fruit to be poisonous, and it took until 1800 for it to be recognized as a valuable vegetable. Fast
forward to today, the tomato is now extensively cultivated across the globe due to its delightful
taste, vibrant color, rich flavor, and nutritious qualities. Tomatoes are a versatile food that can be
enjoyed in various ways, either straight from the garden or after undergoing processing. Including
tomatoes in your diet can be beneficial for maintaining a healthy and balanced eating plan. Not
only do they contain very few calories, but they are also packed with essential nutrients like
vitamin A, vitamin C, and various minerals. Additionally, tomatoes provide small but valuable
amounts of vitamins from the B complex, including thiamin, riboflavin, and niacin, as noted by
Sainju and Dris 2006.
1.1 Background of the study
Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum L) belongs to the Solanaceae family and is an important and
lucrative vegetable crop grown around the world including Uganda for fresh market and
processing. It is ranked as the third most important vegetable worldwide (Shiberu et al., 2018). In


Uganda, tomatoes are among the most important and prominent horticultural crops grown for both
home consumption, domestic market and for export (Kennedy, 2008). Globally, tomato production
is at 177.04 million metric tons while in Uganda is at 38,234 metric tons (FAOSTAT, 2016).
Tomatoes are a good source of iron and contain lycopene, an antioxidant that may protect against
cancer. Yellow tomatoes have more vitamin A than red ones (Naika et al., 2005). Research
indicates that lycopene, a compound found in tomatoes, may lower the chances of prostate cancer
(Miller et al., 2002). Additionally, consuming tomatoes can potentially decrease the likelihood of
gastroenteric diseases like colon, rectal, and stomach cancer. Moreover, tomatoes are easily
digestible and their vibrant color can boost your appetite (Sainju and Dris, 2006).
Plant diseases and pests can cause significant economic losses in agricultural production. A study
conducted by Tolman et al. (2004) found that insect damage led to a loss of approximately 30%
in tomato yield. Detecting infested plants at an early stage, before visual symptoms appear, is
crucial for implementing effective management strategies and pest control measures to prevent
the spread of diseases (Zee et al., 2001; Park et al., 2016). Currently, we rely heavily on
insecticides to control aphids. However, this has led to some aphid species, like the peach,
tomato, and potato aphid, becoming resistant to these chemicals. To address this issue, we need
alternative methods of aphid control. One potential solution is using plant extracts that repel
aphids or discourage them from feeding. This could help decrease the number of aphids on plants
without relying solely on insecticides (Bizzaro et al., 2005; Van Toor et al., 2008; Imbaya et al.,
2018).



1.2 Aphids control in Tomatoes
Several control methods against aphids have been put forward and these include cultural, chemical
and biological means. However, none of the control measures has been validated as such that even
under increased chemical spray cycles; they experience massive losses due to aphids (Zekeya et
al., 2018).
Most local farmers use chemical means by use of synthetic pesticides for example Rocket, dudu
acelmectine... Resource poor farmers on the other hand use cultural methods like crop rotation,
removing of infested plants, and proper disposal of plant debris at the end of season (Retta et al.,
2015). The other control is use of biological control method. This method is potentially a very
beneficial tactic to develop the biological control agents (living antagonists-natural enemies:
predators, parasitoids and pathogens) are considered as one possible solution to most tomato pests
Oztemiz, 2013). This strategy offers a more sustainable and less expensive alternative to chemicals
(Vivan et al., 2003; Bale et al., 2008). Use of garlic extracts and rabbit urine is a cheap, valuable,
safe and environmentally friendly alternative for insect pest management (Shiberu et al., 2018).
These plant extracts naturally contain pest repellant attributes which have the ability to repel or
kill the insect pest at all stages including eggs, larvae, pupae nymphs and adults. However, in
Uganda the using of these garlic extracts and rabbit urine to control pests such as aphids on tomato
has not been fully explored yet there is still a need to improve crop protection against these pests
and in the same way reducing the use of inorganic pesticides (Shiberu and Getu, 2018).

1.3 Statement of the problem
Tomato has a lot of importance however, its production is threatened by destructive pests (Zekeya
et al., 2018). They destroy the leaves, stem, roots and fruits, resulting into low- and poor-quality


yield and even death of plants or rotten fruit (Visser et al., 2017). For example, in the case of
aphids, the economic losses range from 50-100% yield loss in other countries depending on the
tomato variety (Zekeya et al., 2018). The pest has been observed on tomatoes and other Solanaceae
crops as well as the Brassica family crops in Uganda,
Current management of tomato pests has been based on inorganic pesticides such as Belt Expert,
Abamectin, Dudu acelamectin which are very expensive and not affordable to resource poor
farmers. The use of synthetic pesticides is also complicated by the fact that most farmers do not
observe the prescribed dosages and pre-harvest intervals which results into chemical residues in
the fruits affecting export trade and posing health risks to the consumers and drastic effects on the
environment (Klieber et al., 2015; Retta et al., 2015). In addition, biopesticides also have the
ability to provide some required nutrients for plant growth hence making pesticides a better option.
Limited studies have however been conducted to determine the effect of rabbit urine and Garlic
biopesticide on aphid control. Therefore, eeffective pest control is no longer a matter of heavy
application of limited insecticides, because continuous use of pesticides promotes development of
insecticidal resistance in the target pests, pest resurgence, emergence of secondary pests, affects
non-target insects’ species, affects the environment through air pollution, killing of beneficial
organisms, as well as causing human health complications such as skin cancer.
Chemical pesticides are also quite expensive to most of the farmers which has led to
economical loss due to the reduced yields.
Farmers mostly affected are the horticultural farmers in this case (Dilawar Hussaina, 2023).
Therefore, the growing need for alternative, environmentally friendly methods of aphid control.
(Sarwar, 2015 and Grzywacz et al., 2010)


Therefore, this study aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of rabbit urine and Garlic biopesticide
against aphid control and determine the pest infestation on different growth stages of tomato
1.4 Objectives
1.4.1 Main objective
To evaluate the effectiveness of garlic, extract and rabbit urine as natural alternative of controlling aphid
infestations on tomato plants.
1.4.2 Specific objectives

i.
To assess the effect of rabbit urine and garlic concentration on aphid population and aphid
damage on tomato plants
ii.
To determine the effect of rabbit urine and garlic extract concentration on growth response
of tomatoes (Plant height & Number of flowers).
iii.
To determine if there is a relationship between aphid damage and growth of tomato plants.
1.5 Hypotheses
i.
Aphid population and aphid damage in tomatoes are independent of the concentrations of
the rabbit urine and garlic extract concoctions.
ii.
Rabbit urine and garlic extract concoction do not affect the growth response of tomatoes.
iii.
There is no relationship between aphid damage and growth of the tomatoes.
1.6 Scope of the study
The experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of the stinging nettle and garlic based biopesticides
in the control of aphids in tomatoes was carried out at Uganda Christian university’s field trial
plots located in mukono during the period of January 2024 to March 2024. During this study


Asole tomato variety was used and a homemade organic pesticide acquired from a rabbit urine and
garlic extract was also used as a pesticide during this experiment.
1.7 Significance
Tomato growing is one of the most promising areas for horticultural expansion and development
in Uganda (MAAIF, 1998). The biggest tomato producers are the districts of Mbale, Mpigi, Hoima,
Mbarara, Wakiso, and Mukono. Uganda produces 38,234 metric tons of tomatoes per year
(FAOSTAT 2016) of which about 3,000 small-scale farmers grow fresh vegetables including
tomatoes for export while more than 20,000 small-scale farmers grow vegetables particularly
tomatoes for income (Sonko et al., 2005). Since the tomato aphid is threatening the tomato growers
in Uganda, the plant extracts can provide an alternative control, it is important to evaluate their
efficiency. The findings of this study will contribute to improved management of the tomato pests
while protecting the environment, reducing the risks associated with use of synthetic insecticides
and reducing the cost of controlling the pest. This will improve farmers’ incomes and their
livelihoods through increased yields and safety of the tomatoes for consumption while protecting
the environment.
1.8 Justification
Tomatoes are a good source of iron and contain lycopene, an antioxidant that may protect against
cancer. Yellow tomatoes have more vitamin A than red ones (Naika et al., 2005). Research
indicates that lycopene, a compound found in tomatoes, may lower the chances of prostate cancer
(Miller et al., 2002). Additionally, consuming tomatoes can potentially decrease the likelihood of
gastroenteric diseases like colon, rectal, and stomach cancer. Moreover, tomatoes are easily
digestible and their vibrant color can boost your appetite (Sainju and Dris, 2006).


Plant diseases and pests can cause significant economic losses in agricultural production. A study
conducted by Tolman et al. (2004) found that insect damage led to a loss of approximately 30% in
tomato yield. Detecting infested plants at an early stage, before visual symptoms appear, is crucial
for implementing effective management strategies and pest control measures to prevent the spread
of diseases (Zee et al., 2001; Park et al., 2016).
Tomato production in Uganda contributes to economic development and poverty alleviation since
tomatoes are a source of foreign exchange earnings, and also generates income locally for
economic growth (Andre et al, 2005). Since tomato production is reduced by pest infestation. Use
of mechanical methods such as removal of infested leaves have been suggested but can only be
successful on very small plots. Inorganic pesticides are another alternative but the cost of these
pesticides makes tomato production non-profitable. Controlling aphids is not an easy practice
although synthetic pesticides are apparently available for use. Effective pest control is no longer a
matter of heavy application of limited insecticides, because continuous use of pesticides promotes
development of insecticidal resistance in the target pests, pest resurgence, emergence of secondary
pests, affects non-target insects’ species, affects the environment and human health (Sarwar, 2015
and Grzywacz et al., 2010). Therefore, the use of alternatives including botanicals, bio-pesticides,
and new generation synthetic insecticides is essential to growing healthy crops. The use of different
botanical insecticides such as a mixture concentration of rabbit urine and garlic extract to protect
plants from pests is very promising because of several distinct advantages (Marbet and Aurea,
2008). Insecticidal plants are generally much safer than conventionally used synthetic insecticides.
It prevents development of insecticide resistance. Botanical insecticides are used by small-scale
farmers at low cost or zero cost of extraction and are highly degradable. The use of natural and
easily biodegradable crop protection inputs like a mixture of Rabbit urine and Garlic (Allium


sativum) can be a useful component of an integrated pest management (IPM) strategy since the
compounds are known for their low toxicity against beneficial insects (Koona and Njoya, 2004).
Therefore, tomato farmers urgently need a cheaper but effective alternative which can be easily
acquired and home made such the these locally made garlic extract and rabbit urine since they are
locally available materials.
















CHAPTER TWO
2.0 Literature review
2.1 Introduction
The literature reviewed under this chapter provides an evaluative assessment of the pests affecting
tomatoes, classification, origin and economic importance. Challenges faced in controlling some of
these pests particularly aphids as of this case by tomato farmers using garlic extracts and rabbit
urine in tomato production in Uganda.

2.1.1 Tomato production
Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) belongs to Solanaceae family. It is an important and
remunerative vegetable crop grown around the world including Uganda for fresh market and
processing. It is ranked as the third vegetable worldwide (Shiberu et al. 2018). Statistics currently
shows that the production of tomato globally is at 177.04 million metric tons (FAOSTAT 2016).
And Uganda produces 38,234 metric tons of tomatoes per year (FAOSTAT 2016). In Uganda,
tomatoes are among the most important and prominent horticultural crops grown for both home
consumption, domestic market and for export. Production of tomatoes in rural areas of the country
has increased employment and improved farmers’ livelihoods (Kennedy, 2008). However, tomato
production is threatened by the exotic invasive insect pest tomato leaf miner (T. absoluta) (Zekeya
et al. 2018).
2.1.2 Aphids
The green peach aphid (Myzus persicae) is a major agricultural pest that is found worldwide.
While the exact origin is debated, it is likely native to Asia, much like its favorite food source,
the peach tree. (Prunus persica)


2.1.3 Origin and distribution of aphids
The exact origin of aphids is still under debate, but fossil evidence suggests they emerged
sometime in the Permian period, roughly 299 to 252 million years ago. Their long evolutionary
history has resulted in a vast array of species, with estimates ranging from 4,000 to 10,000
However most experts believe the green peach aphid originated in Asia, like its primary host
plant, the peach tree. The green peach aphid is now found almost everywhere in the world except
for areas with extreme temperatures or humidity. They are adept at travelling long distances by
wind, storms, and even on young plants that are transported between locations. This explains
their global reach and ability to survive in various climates. While they don't prefer greenhouses,
they can easily invade them, further contributing to their spread.

2.1.4 Growth of Aphids
An aphid's lifecycle typically involves four stages: egg, nymph (several instars), pupa (in some
species), and adult. Parthenogenesis: During warm weather, female aphids can reproduce
asexually, giving birth to live young without needing a male (Shree et al., 2017). This allows for
rapid population growth when conditions are favorable.
Winged and Wingless Forms: Aphid populations often contain both winged and wingless
individuals. Winged aphids can disperse long distances to find new host plants, while wingless
aphids focus on feeding and reproduction. The specific duration of each stage can vary
depending on the species and environmental factors. However, the overall lifecycle can be
remarkably fast, allowing for rapid population growth under ideal conditions. (Hughes et al.,
2013 and (Balzan, 2015).


2.1.5 Economic importance of Aphids in tomato production
Tomato production is in danger due to the invasion by green peach aphid (Zekeya et al., 2016).
Several authors have consistently reported that, no effective control including use of chemicals is
available for farmers. (Nesreen et al., 2017). They pierce plant tissue with their needle-like
mouthparts to suck out sap. This weakens the plant, stunts growth, and can cause leaves to curl or
turn yellow and as they feed, aphids excrete a sugary substance called honeydew which h attracts
ants and promotes the growth of sooty mold, a black fungus that further reduces photosynthesis
and weakens the plant. In severe infestations, aphids can even transmit viruses between plants,
posing a significant threat to your tomato crop.
Tomato growing farmers in Africa are currently stranded due to lack of effective control options
as even under increased spray cycles, they experience massive losses due to increased aphid
infestation levels (Zekeya et al.,2016).
This however has opened a new window for research and development of new and alternative
control measures. The most recommended and promising approaches include application of
biological control options such as parasitoids and nematodes (Alabern et al., 2013; and Arnaouty
et al., 2014), entomopathogenic fungi and bacteria (Keikotlhaile et al., 2010) and pheromone traps
for monitoring population as well as detection of their presence (Zekeya et al., 2016).
2.1.6 Control of Aphids
Different management options exist for aphids are already in place and these include use of insect
chemicals, cultural methods, physical controls and biological methods (Retta et al., 2015)



2.2 Synthetic insecticides
Conventional pesticides are commonly applied to control insect pests includingAphids. Reports
show the effect of chemical sprays mainly harming untargeted organisms as well as environment
and not the Aphids (Klieber et al., 2015). The nature of infestation especially by the Aphids hiding
underneath the tomato plant leaves and resistance to different chemicals limit control efforts
(Wilcockson et al., 2014).
Common chemicals that aphids have been reported to develop resistance are Cartap, pyrethroids,
organophosphates, spinosad, Emamectin benzoate, Abamectin, chloride channel activators,
benzoylureas and diamide (Zekeya et al., 2016). Synthetic chemicals have serious drawbacks,
including reduced profits from high insecticide costs, destruction of natural enemy populations
(Campbell et al., 1991), buildup of insecticide residues on tomato fruits (Walgenbach et al., 1991)
and in the environment and fundamentally the rapid development of insecticide resistance. Pest
resistance has been reported to cause increased use of chemical pesticides applications against
Aphids in many parts of the world including Uganda (Roditakis et al., 2015).
In countries such as Tunisia, more than 18 chemicals were introduced during 2009-2011 for the
control of Aphids but none of them seemed efficient in solving the pest problem (Abbes et al.,
2012). However, chemical pesticides are very expensive and are applied frequently to the extent
that most smallholder farmers in Africa cannot afford to purchase regularly (Zekeya et al., 2016).

2.2.1 Use of plant extracts (Garlic)
Allium sativum, commonly known as garlic, has been widely utilized in culinary practices and
traditional medicine for more than 4000 years. It possesses various beneficial properties such as
antiseptic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, cardioprotective, and anticancer effects. The


antimicrobial activity of garlic is attributed to its prominent organ sulfur compounds, including
ajoenes, allicin, alliin, allyl sulfide, and 1,2- vinyldithiin (Lanzotti 2006; Corzo Martinez et al.,
2007; Martins et al., 2016). For instance, Gong et al. (2013) conducted a study on the impact of
2% raw garlic straw extracts on root- knot nematodes (Meloidogyne incognita) in tomato plants.
The researchers observed that the garlic extracts inhibited the growth of nematodes and led to an
increase in tomato yield. Similarly, Jess et al. (2017) explored the potential use of garlic oil in
controlling Megaselia halterata (a species of phorid fly) in commercial mushroom production. The
researchers found that low concentrations (ranging from 0.1% to 20%) of garlic solutions
effectively repelled adult female M. halterata. A commonly recommended recipe for a garlic
solution involves using 25 grams of chopped garlic in 10 liters of water. This solution can be
applied to the soil and plants, exhibiting effectiveness against various pathogens such as fungi and
bacteria, as well as pests including mites, aphids, larvae of Lepidoptera, and small bedbugs
(Ministerio de Agricultura. Servicio Agrícola y Ganadero, 2013). Garlic (Allium sativum L.) is a
highly effective plant-based bio-pesticide known for its ability to control seed-borne diseases. It
contains allicin, a compound that gives garlic its distinctive smell and taste while providing
biological properties. Studies have shown that garlic possesses insecticidal and fungicidal
properties, making it effective against pests like mites, ticks, nematodes, and worms. These
characteristics make garlic a valuable resource for pest management and disease control in
agriculture and veterinary applications. Therefore, the appropriate use of eco-friendly microbial
pesticides can be engaged in recreation of sustainable organic crop production by providing a
stable pest management program.
Biological control method is potentially very beneficial tactic to develop (Savinoet et al., 2012).
The biological control agents (living antagonists-natural enemies: predators, parasitoids and


pathogens) are considered as one possible solution of the aphid’s crisis (Desneux et al., 2010;
Oztemiz, 2013). This strategy offers a more sustainable and less expensive alternative to chemicals
(Vivan et al, 2003; Bale et al., 2008).
2.2.3 Rabbit Urine
Rabbit urine has been used as a natural pesticide for centuries, and there is some scientific evidence
to support its effectiveness against aphids. Studies have shown that rabbit urine can repel aphids,
reduce their egg-laying ability, and even kill them outright because of it’s Components
Rabbit urine contains several components that are thought to be responsible for its insecticidal
properties. These include:
Ammonia: Ammonia is a pungent gas that can repel aphids and other insects. It can also damage
their delicate respiratory systems.
Urea: Urea is a nitrogen-rich compound that can disrupt the hormonal balance of aphids and other
insects. It can also interfere with their ability to reproduce, it as well dehydrates the aphids when
in close contact (Diana Kemunto,2022)
Creatinine: Creatinine is a waste product of muscle metabolism. It is not directly harmful to aphids,
but it can make rabbit urine more attractive to beneficial insects, such as ladybugs and lacewings,
which prey on aphids.
Several studies have explored the insecticidal properties of rabbit urine and garlic individually.
Rabbit urine diluted with water at a ratio of 1:10 has been shown to effectively control aphids on
kale plants (Petrović et al., 2013). Rabbit urine is a readily available substances which has
demonstrated insecticidal properties. Rabbit urine contains high levels of nitrogen, which can act


as a fertilizer and also possesses insecticidal activity (Petrović et al., 2015) Therefore Combining
rabbit urine and garlic could potentially create a synergistic natural pesticide with enhanced
insecticidal efficacy against aphids.







CHAPTER THREE
3.0 Methods and materials
3.1 Experimental site
The experiment was carried out in Mukono district at Mukono at Kyawambogo village from
January 2024 to March 2024. Kyawambogo village s located about 28km from Uganda’s capital
and main city, Kampala, along Jinja road. The village has wooded savannah vegetation
characterized by tall trees and tall grasses. According to FAO 1992, Mukono has two main soils
categories namely; Ferralitic soils and Ferrisols, a high plateau (1000-1300) above sea level and
mean annual rainfall is 11,000mm distributed over 106 rain days, with peaks in March – June and
September – November. Temperatures range between 160C and 280C throughout the year.

3.2 Materials
Garden infested with Aphids for samples, Rabbit urine, fresh Garlic bulbs,hand sprayer,Tomato
seeds for cultivar MV were used in this study. The seedlings were raised in a nursery bed and
transplanted at three weeks after germination with the starter dose of 20g of NPK fertilizer per
plant. Our bio pesticide of rabbit urine and garlic were used and a untreated control was also
included for comparison.

3.3 Soil Sampling
A composite soil sample was collected randomly from the 0-20 cm depth at the field station in
January 2024. Physical properties of the soil were analyzed at the UCU laboratory



3.4 Experimental design
The experimental field was laid in a Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with three
replications.

3.5 Agronomic practices
During the experiment, the following agronomic practices were carried out;
Land clearing, ploughing and harrowing was done by use of a hand hoe to break down soil particles
and remove unwanted objects, and the plots were demarcated in of size 3m× 3m with a total of 12
plots.
Transplanting was done in February 2024 by placing one seedling at spacing of 60 by 60cm.
Watering by use of a watering can was done occasionally whenever there was need especially if
there was no rain, watering was done twice a day
Weeding was done whenever weeds emerged by hand pulling and use of a hand hoe.
Plots were uniformly mulched 2 weeks after planting with dry grass to avoid evaporation of water
and nutrients.
Staking was done one month after planting to prevent the plant from being disturbed by wind and
also encourage straight growth.
Spraying of the bio pesticide was done weekly as indicated in 3.6 (application of pesticides) was
done to control pests specifical the aphid. This was carried out using a hand sprayer.

3.7 Making of the extract
The organic pesticide extract was made following the procedure below;


The garlic extract was obtained by crushing fresh garlic bulbs and extracting the juice. It was
diluted with water to achieve the desired concentrations for each treatment whereas the rabbit urine
was used immediately after being mixed


3.8 Treatments and bio pesticide extract application
The treatments were sprayed once in 1 week in each assigned plot apart from the control plot,
Treatment T1 (control): No mixture concentration was applied (0%).
Treatment T2: Low Dose - A diluted concentration of garlic & rabbit urine was prepared by
mixing 5(ml) of garlic extract and 5(ml) of rabbit urine to make 10(ml) with 90 ml of water (10%).
Treatment T3: Medium Dose - A moderately concentrated rabbit urine & garlic extract was
prepared by mixing 30 ml made up of 15(ml) garlic extract, 15(ml) of rabbit urine with 70 ml of
water (30%).
Treatment T4: High Dose - The highest concentration of garlic extract was prepared by mixing 50
ml made up of 25(ml) garlic extract, 25(ml) of rabbit urine of garlic extract with 50 ml of water
(50

3.9 Data collection
In every week data was collected once. This was followed by tagging of ten plants in each plot.
To identify the level of infestation of the pest, Inspections were done on entire plant, and the areas
considered were leaves damaged, plant height, number of aphids at the different growth stages of
the plants (FAO 2006).


3.9.1 Data analysis
All data collected were entered and sorted using Microsoft Excel (version2013). The sorted data
was thereafter imported into GenStat (12th Edition) to obtain the means, standard errors,
Coefficient of Variation and P-values by running the One-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA),
(Diana Kemunto,2022) and separated means using a Boniferi’s test to determine significant
differences between the treatments and evaluate the efficacy of garlic extract and rabbit urine concoction
as an aphid control agent on tomato plants. In addition to assessing aphid control, the study also
considered several parameters as part of the investigation, including plant height, leaf damage caused by
aphids, Number of aphids and Number of flowers at flowering stage. These parameters provided a
comprehensive evaluation of the effects of garlic extract and rabbit urine concoction on the tomato plants
and their potential as a natural aphid control measure. (Diana Kemunto,2022)














CHAPTER FOUR
4.0 Objective 1
4.1 About number of aphids
Table 1 below shows the means and standard deviations of aphid population and aphid damage
uunder different treatments. The results showed that there was significant difference in the aphid
population and aphid damage on the number of damaged leaves per plant, and number of aphids
per plants.
From the table below, Treatment (T4) turned out to be the most effective between the aphid
population and the aphid damage with the least number of damage leaves per plant and number of
aphids per plant compared to Treatments (T2, T3) and the control which presented the higher
damaged leaves per plant and more number of aphids per plant.

From the experiment, very low response was observed at Treatments (T1), with 0.969 number of flowers.
Whereas for the other treatments T2,T3 and T4 revealed relatively higher responses of 1.292, 1.769 and
2.631 respectively. The experiment also exhibited higher responses for plant height in plants under
treatment T4 with 58.36cm and lower responses were observed in other treatments of T1 with the least
response of 22.27cm as it is highest plant height followed by treatments T2, and T3 respectively.

4.3 Objective 3
The results exhibit that the "Leaf Damage per Plant" is denoted (-0.256). This indicates that as the number
of leaves damaged by aphids increases, there's a trend for tomato growth to decrease. However, the table
shows a statistically significant constant effect on tomato growth (t pr. < .001). This implies there's likely
a baseline level of growth independent of aphid damage therefore this shows that there is a relationship
between aphid damage and growth of tomato plants.

4.4 Results and Discussion
The results of the efficacy assessment of garlic extract as a natural aphid control agent on infected tomato
plants are presented in Table 6. The measurements taken include plant height, damage to leaves per
plant, number of flowers per plant, and number of aphids per treatment.



4.5 Objective 1 (Aphid population & Aphid damage)
The severity of leaf damage caused by aphids was assessed for each treatment. The control group (T1)
had the highest damage score, denoted by the mean of 10.85±10.2 since it also exhibited the highest
number of aphids. However, all treatments with garlic extract and rabbit urine (T2, T3, and T4) exhibited
lower damage scores, suggesting the potential of garlic extract and rabbit urinein reducing leaf damage
caused by aphids. In a study conducted by Gravel et al., 2007, it was demonstrated that daily disulphide,
a component found in the essential oil of garlic, possesses insecticidal characteristics that exhibit efficacy
against various pests, including the Alternaria Solani species.

4.6 Objective 2 (Plant height & Number of flowers)
The tomato plants treated with different doses of rabbit urine and garlic extract exhibited varying heights.
The control group T1 had a plant height of 22.27cm while the plants treated with in T2, T3, and T4 doses
of garlic extract and rabbit Urine showed heights of 32.52cm, 34.62cm, 58.36cm respectively. The highest
value was observed in T4, indicating a positive correlation between garlic extract and rabbit urine
concentration dose and plant height. The control group exhibited the least number of flowers at flowering
stage with a mean of 0.969±0.1377 while the plants treated with in T2, T3 and T4 doses of garlic and rabbit
urine showed highest number of flowers according to a study reported by Arora et al. (2014), they found
that using a combination of garlic is more effective in pest control compared to using only garlic. Garlic
acts as a natural pesticide, inhibiting the growth of pests and insects, while also improving plant growth
parameters such as height.

4.7 Objective 3 (Relationship between aphid damage & growth of tomato plants)
The results exhibit that the "Leaf Damage per Plant" is denoted (-0.256). This indicates that as the number
of leaves damaged by aphids increases, there's a trend for tomato growth to decrease. However, the table


shows a statistically significant constant effect on tomato growth (t pr. < .001). This implies there's likely
a baseline level of growth independent of aphid damage. Factors like tomato variety, soil nutrients, and
overall plant health could contribute to this constant effect. According to a study conducted by P., &
Manicardi, G. C. (2005). Effect of Garlic on Green Peach Aphid (Myzus persicae) on Pepper (Capsicum
annuum)39, 1968–1977 where they found that using a combination of garlic is more effective in pest
control compared to using only garlic. Garlic acts as a natural pesticide, inhibiting the growth of pests and
insects.






CHAPTER FIVE
5.0 Conclusions and Recommendations
5.1 Conclusions.
In conclusion, the efficacy assessment of garlic extracts and rabbit urine concoction as a natural aphid
control agent on infested tomato plants revealed promising results. The study examined the effects of
different doses of garlic extract and rabbit urine concoction on various parameters, including plant
height, damage to leaves per plant, Number of aphids and number of flowers. The treatments with
garlic extract and rabbit urine concoction exhibited positive effects on most of parameters, with higher
doses demonstrating greater efficacy. The results showed the potential of garlic extract and rabbit urine
concoction in improving tomato crop yield and economic returns for farmers. Based on the findings,

5.2 Recommendations.
Since this experiment only focused on one dry season, its recommended that the rabbit urine and
garlic extract concoction can be used for many other seasons because in a rainy season the aphids
can be washed away. Other parameters such as yield per plant and overall yield can also be taken
into consideration in order to tell if the concoction affects the yields of these tomatoes in any
way. The Rabbit urine and Garlic extract concoction should also be tested on other pests rather
than aphids
