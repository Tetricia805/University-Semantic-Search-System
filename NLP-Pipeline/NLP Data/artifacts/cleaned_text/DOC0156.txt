CHAPTER ONE
1.0 Introduction
Bio-slurry is waste water generated from the biogas production. Waste water
management involves collection, treatment and reuse of waste water generated
from domestic, industrial and agricultural activities to protect public health and the
environment from harmful substances. Waste water treatment methods range from
chemical, biological and physical treatments.
In efforts to combat climate change through use of cleaner energy generation
technologies, the biogas technology emerged. In developing countries such as
Uganda there is an increase in adoption of this technology as an alternative energy
source to meet their cooking and lighting demands, as a result the production of bio
slurry has also increased.
Bio slurry is used as a bio fertilizer due to the abundant nutrient content it contains,
both macro and micro nutrients which is essential for thriving of crops and the excess
released into the environment. However, bio-slurry contains pathogenic
microorganisms that end up surviving after the anaerobic process during biogas
generation and its management is crucial to public health and environmental
protection. Pathogens in untreated bio-slurry pose significant health risks and
environmental degradation risks which necessitate the treatment of the bio-slurry.
This study aims to assess the use of agricultural lime for pathogen suppression in
bio-slurry, with a focus on pH adjustment of the bio-slurry in order to suppress the
pathogens. The specific objectives focus on determining the microbiological and
physicochemical properties of the bio-slurry, determining the pH adjustment
properties of the agricultural lime for pathogen suppression in bio-slurry, and


development of an agricultural lime treatment model for pathogen suppression in
This research has been concluded, with all specific objectives achieved, the first
two by experimental analysis and the third by both model configuration and
experimental analysis hence the main objective being achieved at the end, The
details of these analyses are outlined in this report beginning with the background
of the study, problem statement, study objectives, research questions, justification,
literature review, methodology, sample collection, results and discussion, design,
conclusions, recommendations and appendices.
1.1
Background
Bio-digesters are a sustainable solution given that they are a multi-purpose
technology, that is for sanitation, energy production and the resultant by-product
produced is used as a bio fertilizer, these address crucial aspects across developing
countries on the continent of Africa today (Delhi, 2024). These benefits make biodigesters very desirable for improving food security, and significantly reducing
dependence on fuels such as firewood and charcoal whose production and
consumption have greatly led to deforestation and air pollution.
Biogas digesters are airtight enclosed structures designed to enhance the anaerobic
digestion of organic matter such as animal dung, human excreta, waste food,
agricultural waste among others. This organic matter is the feedstock used in the
biogas digester to produce biogas which is then collected and used for purposes such
as cooking (Delhi, 2024). Besides biogas, the process results in the production of a
nutrient rich bio-slurry which can be utilized as a fertilizer.


Mukono Boarding Primary School (MBPS) located in Mukono district, Uganda,
installed a fixed dome bio-digester in 2021 in order to partially substitute the use of
firewood for cooking food for over 1000 pupils. The feedstock for the bio-digester is
human excreta from the girl’s dormitory toilets which is flushed into the bio-digester
with 30 liters of water twice daily. The by-products from the digester are biogas
which is used for cooking, and bio-slurry which is mostly released into the
environment and partly utilized by farmers within and around the school as a bio
fertilizer to stimulate crop yield.
However, human waste when not managed adequately, it not only poses a risk to
the human health but also affects economic development as well as the social
wellbeing of individuals in a society (CDC, 2024). Therefore, effective faecal waste
management is crucial in order to mitigate or address these concerns.
This study focuses on the use of pH treatment for pathogenic microorganisms
suppression in bio slurry by use of agricultural lime as the material for pH adjustment
(Ece, 2023). Agricultural lime has the ability to raise pH effectively in order to create
alkaline conditions such that pathogenic microorganisms are suppressed since
alkaline conditions are inhospitable for pathogens, consequently inactivating them
and reducing their numbers in the bio slurry (Ece, 2023).







1.2 Problem Statement
Human excreta based bio slurry can contain various species of pathogenic
microorganisms such as E.coli, salmonella, staphylococcus helminths among others,
which pose detrimental effects on human health and the environment, when not
managed adequately, therefore treatment of this bio slurry is required before
application as a bio fertilizer and release into the environment.
Mukono Boarding Primary School (MBPS) does not have a treatment system for the
bio-slurry it produces as a result of the bio-digestion process. Some of the bio-slurry
produced is utilized by farmers as a fertilizer, but most of it is released into the
ground daily without any known pretreatment or retention time for stabilization and
suppression of pathogens as recommended by NEMA. Furthermore, during heavy
down pours of rain, the bio-slurry overflows from the outlet chamber and joins
surface runoff.
There is no known study that has assessed the bio-slurry from MBPS, but evidence
from preliminary laboratory findings suggest that the quality of the bio-slurry does
not meet the acceptable standards of discharge into the environment (NEMA, 2020;
Williams & Overbo, 2015). This poses a health risk to the farmers who directly utilize
the untreated bio-slurry as a fertilizer, contamination risk to the vegetables, and
also poses the risk of surface water pollution.
The purpose of this research therefore was to assess the use of agricultural lime for
pathogen suppression in bio-slurry. This has the potential to minimize the pathogens
in bio-slurry to make it safer for use as a fertilizer and more environmentally friendly
for discharge.

2. What are the pH adjustment properties of agricultural lime for pathogen
suppression in bio-slurry?

bio-slurry?
1.5 GEOGRAPHICAL SCOPE
The geographical scope of this study is Mukono Boarding Primary School Located in
Mukono district, Uganda, roughly 1km off the Kampala-Jinja highway. the bio
digester is stationed within the school



1.6. Justification
Bio-slurry generally contains several microorganisms including pathogenic
microorganisms and helminths which have a significant relation with human health
risk. However, among the categories of bio slurry, according to the nature of feed
stock, human excreta based bio slurry has the highest level of adverse effects on the
environment and human health if reasesd into the environment without treatment
(Islam A.M et al, 2019) The most significant pathogenic microorganisms include
E.coli, Salmonella, Staphylococcus, and helminth Ascaris lumbricoides as
determined from preliminary tests carried out in the Uganda Christian university
micro biology laboratory. The results obtained are similar to previous studies carried
out on bio slurry (Drabe, 2024).
According to a study carried out in Bangladesh, the prevalence of 17.4% for
Salmonella, 100% E.coli prevalence and 3.2% prevalence for Staphylococcus was
reported on vegetables which was associated with the use of bio-slurry resulted in
cases of death and gastro-intestinal problems. An antimicrobial susceptibility test
was done and confirmed that even after anaerobic digestion, some of the pathogenic
microorganisms survive and can easily be transmitted to man (Islam et al., 2019).
pH treatment plays a crucial role in the safety and effectiveness of bio slurry
applications particularly concerning human health risk, therefore, this study aims to
apply pH treatment, specifically alkaline treatment for suppression of pathogens in
bio slurry. This mechanism involves increasing the pH of bio slurry to create alkaline
conditions which are inhabitable for pathogenic microorganisms (Ang.M et al, 2023)
Agricultural lime consists of calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate. When
agricultural lime is introduced into bio slurry, the water in the bio slurry reacts with


cause the release of hydroxide ions in the bio slurry when added to it which cause a
raise in pH effectively (Mallarino & Haq, 2017)
Bio-slurry is made up of over 90% water, and when agricultural lime is added to the
bio-slurry, it undergoes hydrolysis.
Calcium carbonate dissolves in the presence of dissolved Carbon dioxide which is
present in the bio-slurry.
CaCO3(s) + 2 H2O Ca(OH)2(aq) + H2 CO3(aq)
This reaction produces calcium hydroxide which is a strong base and carbonic acid,
as weak acid. The calcium hydroxide then rapidly ionizes
Ca(OH)2 Ca2+ + 2OH-
The hydroxide ions directly increase pH of the bio slurry creating alkaline conditions,
in addition the calcium ions replace hydrogen ions on colloids surfaces
simultaneously, further neutralizing acidity of bio slurry.
High pH denatures proteins, disrupts ionic balances, and neutralizes acidic
components in pathogens. Alkaline environments hinder enzymatic activities critical
for pathogen survival and reproduction. Elevated pH induces dehydration in cells by
increasing osmotic pressure thereby damaging membrane integrity (Mallarino & Haq,
2017).
This research intends to utilize agricultural lime to create alkaline conditions in bioslurry for suppression of pathogenic microorganisms and helminths. This research
primarily focuses on E.coli, Salmonella, Staphylococcus, and Ascaris lumbricoides.


Additionally, agricultural lime is beneficial for agricultural soil in that it corrects soil
acidity, enhances nutrient availability, and promotes long-term soil health and
sustainability (Mallarino & Haq, 2017). Furthermore, agricultural lime is costeffective and widely available in Uganda.
1.7 Significance of the Study
When bio-slurry from human excreta is treated to suppress the pathogen load in it
through agricultural lime treatment, it creates a bio-fertilizer that is safe for
agricultural use to boost crop yield without crop quality being compromised due to
pathogenic contamination. (de Groot & Bogdanski, 2013).
Human excreta is a major source of pathogens that cause diseases such as cholera,
diarrhea, typhoid among others, when poorly managed, human excreta can lead to
widespread outbreaks of these epidemic diseases especially in developing countries.
Therefore, treatment of human excreta based bio slurry ids mandatory before being
discharged into the environment and before use as a bio fertilizer.
Past studies have that lime treatment effectively suppresses bacteria viruses and
parasites by creating alkaline conditions that disrupts their survival mechanisms
(Strande et al, 2023). By demonstrating the efficiency of agricultural lime in
suppression of pathogenic microbial loads in bio slurry, more benefits are harnessed
from bio slurry compared to the demerits associated with it, therefore reducing
health risks, improving environmental health and boosting crop yield.
This research aims to sustainably manage waste by exploring lime treatment as a
method for pathogen suppression in bio slurry. The treated bio slurry can then be
safely reused for agriculture to improve soil structure, neutralize acidic soils since
it contains agricultural lime and boost crop yield, all these align with global efforts


to achieve sustainable development goals (SDGs) particularly SDG 6 that is about
clean water and sanitation and SDG 13 that talks about climate action by
encouraging resource recovery from waste (WHO, 2023).
This research has a potential of having a direct implication for practitioners in the
agricultural and sanitation sector, this is because agricultural lime is ideal for soil
given that it is recommended for agricultural use, it is widely available, cost
effective and easy to apply, making it an accessible solution for both rural and urban
settings (Strande et al, 2018)
By providing evidence based recommendations on lime dosage, contact time
required and mixing requirements, via laboratory experimental analysis, this study
provides guidelines for implementing this effective waste management strategy.


CHAPTER TWO
2.0 Literature Review
2.1 Introduction
Bio-slurry is a nutrient rich by product from the biogas production process, the
composition of bio slurry varies according to the category/ type of feedstock fed
into the bio digester, feed stock range from cow dung, waste food, agricultural
waste (crop residue), poultry droppings, human excreta among others. During
anaerobic digestion of feed stock in the bio digester, about 25-30% of the total solid
content will be converted into a combustible gas and a residue of 70-75% of the total
solid content of the feed stock comes out as sludge which is known as bio slurry
(Warnars and Oppenoorth, 2014).
According to literature, bio slurry physical consists of, 93% water and 7% dry matter,
of this dry matter, 4.5% is organic matter and the remaining 2.5% is inorganic matter.
Chemically, bio slurry is composed of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, zinc,
manganese as well as copper, this is the typical composition of cow dung and human
excreta based bio slurry (Islam et al, 2019), which as well harbor pathogens such as
salmonella, E.coli, staphylococcus among others, as confirmed by literature and
preliminary laboratory analyses.
Mukono boarding primary school has s fixed dome bio digester that receives human
excreta from the female pupils’ toilet facilities, flushed with 60 liters of water as
feedstock for biogas production. The system consists of a 10 toilet unit that feed the
bio digester. Occasionally, the bio digester is fed with cow dung that is mixed with
water and fed in through a booster chamber that is connected to the bio digester by
a pipe, the cow dung boosts methane production.


The bio digester system at MBPS is designed in such a way that as fresh excreta is
flushed into the bio digester, and displaces the old feedstock that has gone through
anaerobic digestion and is known as bio slurry. This bio slurry is released into an
outlet chamber containing aa discharge pipe at the bottom and steadily injects bio
slurry into the soil underground. According to a key informant from MBPS, farmers
in and around the school collect this bio slurry from the outlet chamber and apply it
to their gardens as a bio fertilizer, there is no known pretreatment that the bio
slurry is subjected to before use
2.2 Topic of Study
The literature review is structured around the specific objectives of the research.
Firstly, the study explores literature on the microbiological and physicochemical
properties of the bio-slurry with emphasis on pathogens such as E.coli, Salmonella,
Staphylococcus, Ascaris lumbricoides eggs, parameters such as pH, and nutrient
content. Secondly, the study analyses research on the use of agricultural lime for
pathogen suppression and bio-slurry treatment applications. Finally, the study
reviews existing treatment models for pathogen suppression and identifies the
theoretical basis for model development and its practical implications.
This review outlines relevant studies that have informed the research while
identifying gaps in existing knowledge. There are documented benefits of lime
treatment in wastewater and sludge stabilization and utilization of agricultural lime
for neutralization of acidic soils, but limited research exists on the direct application
of agricultural lime to bio-slurry. This is particularly limited in the context of
optimizing dosage, treatment time, and long-term pathogen suppression. While
various disinfection and stabilization models exist, such as chlorination, there is no


known integration of the specific physicochemical interactions of agricultural lime
with bio-slurry components. These gaps justify the need for a customized and
specific agricultural lime treatment model for pathogen suppression as developed in
this study.
2.3 Determination of the Microbiological and Physicochemical Properties of the
Bio-Slurry
2.3.1 Microbial Composition of Bio-Slurry
Bio-slurry is a good quality organic fertilizer that is a source of micro and macro
nutrients as well as organic matter, this component influences soil structure and
introduces microorganisms into soil and this stimulates crop yield. Human excreta
based bio slurry contains a variety of microbial communities both beneficial and
pathogenic microorganisms. The beneficial microorganisms breakdown organic
matter in soil for easy absorption by crops and they aerate soils which aid crop roots
during soil penetration (Islam et al, 2019). Studies have shown that untreated human
excreta based bio-slurry also contains high levels of pathogenic microorganisms such
as, E.coli, Salmonella, Staphylococcus, Ascaris lumbricoides (Islam et al., 2019).
These pathogens survive in bio-slurry after the anaerobic digestion process and their
life span and rate of reproduction or multiplication in the bio slurry depend on
factors such as pH, temperature, retention time of the bio slurry, and availability of
organic matter to feed on. In systems operating at mesophilic temperatures (30 –
400C), the growth of pathogenic microorganisms is stimulated due to the ideal
conditions (Drabe, 2024). From all these findings it is therefore concluded that there
is a need for treatment of this bio slurry in order to suppress pathogens.


2.3.2 Physicochemical Properties of Bio-Slurry
Physicochemical parameters are play an important role in microbial survival and bioslurry stability. The parameters include pH, potassium, total phosphorous,
temperature, total dissolved solids (TDS).
pH typically ranges between 6.5 and 8.5 which is conducive to microbial activity.
Studies suggest that pH ranges above 9.0 are not ideal for microbial activity.
Potassium and total phosphorous are important nutrients which make bio-slurry
beneficial for application in agriculture. The composition of the nutrients before and
after treatment is an important indicator of the effectiveness of the treatment.
Studies suggest that these provide an ideal environment for microbial growth.
Total dissolved solids (TDS) are an important representation of the micro-nutrients
present within the bio-slurry that have an impact on the microbial activity and the
application of the bio-slurry as a fertilizer. This composition is important before and
after treatment and is a vital indicator of the effectiveness of the treatment.
Research suggests that this provides a fertile environment for microbial growth.
Mesophilic digestion temperatures (30 – 400C) reduce but do not completely
eliminate pathogens. This suggests that there is a need for post digestion treatment
of the bio-slurry.
2.3.3 Critical Analysis and Research Gaps
A series of lime treatment studies have been carried out using a variety of lime
products including by using hydrated lime (Ca(OH)2), quick lime (CaO) and Dolomitic
lime (CaMg(CO3)2), for waste water and sludge disinfection. However, there is
limited literature focusing on lime treatment as applied to treatment of human
excreta based bio slurry and there is no known literature on studies that have been


carried out on use of agricultural lime for treatment of bio slurry or any form of
waste water. This research addresses this knowledge gap by investigating/ assessing
the use of agricultural lime for pathogen suppression in bio slurry, hence
contributing valuable insights into the chemical and microbiological dynamics of
lime treatment (Vinneras et al, 2023).
2.4 Determination of the pH Adjustment Properties of Agricultural Lime for
Pathogen Suppression in Bio-Slurry
From a number of literature reviewed, there are various studies carried out on
different treatment methods for waste water that have been widely adopted to
mitigate the concerns of pathogenic microorganisms. These are as follows;
Anaerobic digestion
This involves the breakdown of organic matter in the absence of oxygen by
microorganisms, it combines bio gas production and it effectively reduces bacterial
and viral pathogenic loads.
 Significant retention time required, approximately 30 to 60 days
 Consistent monitoring of operation conditions
 Limited pathogen removal for resilient organisms like helminth eggs
(Jha et al, 2021)






Composting
Aerobic composting uses thermophilic conditions to deactivate pathogens.
Temperatures are maintained between 55 to 600c for prolonged periods, this ensures
deactivation of bacteria and helminths making it suitable for agricultural use.
 Strict temperature and moisture controls are required for effective pathogen
inactivation
 Large space required to carry out this treatment
 Odor issues may arise during operations
(Hussain et al, 2022)
Lactic Acid Fermentation
This treatment method lowers pH and created antimicrobial conditions significantly
reducing bacterial loads
 Less effective for helminths
 Limited large scale applicability
 Created acidic conditions in soil which is not favorable for crops
(Hussain et al, 2022)
Others include; Thermal treatment, Maturation ponds, Trickling filters, Rapid and
slow sand, chlorination among others.
Lime treatment is widely recognized for its ability to inactivate pathogens through
pH elevation. When added to water in the presence of carbon dioxide, lime


dissociates into calcium ions (Ca2+) and hydroxide ions (OH-), which raises pH levels
to above 9.0 and disrupts microbial cell functions (Schwab et al., 2007).
Lime stabilization has been successfully applied in wastewater treatment plants and
sludge treatment. Municipal sludge treatment suggests that lime-treated sludge
showed a 4-log reduction in bacterial counts within 48 hours (Sravan et al., 2024).
Livestock waste treatment using lime suggests that lime eliminated pathogens in
dairy and pig farm waste. The findings further suggest that lime treatment
significantly reduces the risk of waterborne disease transmission.
The jar test is a widely utilized technique for determination of optimum dosage for
lime treatment in municipal wastewater treatment and sludge treatment.
2.4.1 Critical Analysis and Research Gaps
Most studies on lime stabilization focus on municipal sludge with limited studies
addressing bio-slurry from bio-digesters that utilize human excreta as feedstock.
There is insufficient research on optimizing lime dosage for pathogen suppression in
bio-slurry while maintaining agronomic value.
Long-term pathogen survival and pH stability in lime-treated bio-slurry remain
underexplored.
2.5 Development of an Agricultural Lime Treatment Model for Pathogen
Suppression in Bio-Slurry
Municipal wastewater management and municipal sludge management usually
involves chemical additives such as chlorine treatment to stabilize the material and
suppress pathogens (MWE, 2013). Some water treatment systems utilize baffle
mixing designs to facilitate mixing of coagulant with water for coagulation and


flocculation treatment, but there is no known mixing technology for treatment of
bio-slurry with agricultural lime.
The exponential decay model is a well-known model for the study of microorganism
death and decay (Objectives & Model, n.d.). However, there is no known study that
has utilized the model to assess the suppression of pathogens in bio-slurry using
agricultural lime.
2.5.1 Critical Analysis and Research Gaps
Most existing models do not account for the unique microbiological and
physicochemical interactions of agricultural lime within bio-slurry. There is no
known standardized model for pathogen suppression in bio-slurry.
There are little known guidelines on the practical guidelines regarding the timing
and method of applying agricultural lime to bio-slurry.
Building upon existing models, this study proposes a treatment system preliminary
design comprising of a dosing chamber for controlled addition of agricultural lime to
the bio-slurry, a baffle mixing channel for uniform distribution of agricultural lime
in the bio-slurry, and retention chambers to hold bio-slurry for durations sufficient
to achieve pathogen suppression.
The resultant bio-slurry after treatment is required to be safe for use as a fertilizer
and for discharge into the environment.
Management Practices
 Bio slurry should be stored in sealed and hygienic conditions to prevent
pathogen exposure during transportation or storage. Proper training in
handling is crucial to minimize occupational risks (Hussain et al, 2022)


 Treated bio slurry should be applied in fields with adequate waiting periods
(contact time to ensure pathogen suppression
 In rural areas as well as peri-urban areas, small scale systems to allow local
re use while minimizing transportation costs, these systems align with circular
economy principles by integrating biogas production and bio fertilizer
recovery
 Policy interventions are needed to enforce standards for bio slurry treatment
and use, community training programs raise awareness about health risks and
sustainable practices (Harroff et al, 2022)
Barriers discovered with the use of bio fertilizers include inconsistent pathogen in
activation across methods limited access to advanced technologies in developing
countries, public resistance due to stigma.
Therefore, raising need for future strategies that should focus on cost-effective
decentralization systems, improved pathogen monitoring technologies and
integration into circular economy frameworks to enhance adoption and
sustainability.





CHAPTER THREE
3.0 Methodology
3.1 Introduction
This chapter outlines the methods that were utilized to assess the use of agricultural
lime in suppressing pathogens in bio-slurry. The methodology focused on analyzing
the microbiological and physicochemical properties of bio-slurry, pH adjustment
properties of agricultural lime for pathogen suppression in bio-slurry, and
development of an agricultural lime treatment model for pathogen suppression in
This research was conducted on bio-slurry from the bio-digester at Mukono Boarding
Primary School (MBPS). The bio-slurry was analyzed from the NWSC Central
Laboratory and the UCU Environmental Laboratory.
3.2 Research Design
A laboratory-based experimental design for quantitative analysis and qualitative
analysis was adopted for this study. This approach enabled control of variables and
accurate assessment of the impact of agricultural lime on pathogen suppression in
bio-slurry. The study involved systematic sampling, controlled agricultural lime
dosages, microbiological, and physicochemical analyses. This design allowed for
precise measurement and statistical analysis. The analysis was in line with the NWSC
Standard Operating Procedures, the exponential decay model, and the Water Supply
Design Manual (Freeman et al., 2021; MWE, 2013; Objectives & Model, n.d.)




3.3 Sampling Technique
The sample collection was performed based on the following general guidelines:
 Homogenization of the bio-slurry in the collection tank
 Use of autoclaved bottles
 Use of sterile containers
 Use of gloves and medical masks
 Labels for identification
 Sample storage in an ice cooler (40C) with ice packs for temperature control
during transport
 Collection of sample during dry weather to prevent dilution from rainwater
(de Groot & Bogdanski, 2013; Freeman et al., 2021).
The sample collection techniques that were followed are summarized in Table 1.

Bio-slurry samples were collected from the bio-digester at MBPS.
The bio-slurry in the outlet chamber was stirred properly to ensure even distribution
and homogeneity of the bio-slurry.
Samples were collected from three different locations within the outlet chamber,
that is, the center, and two ends 1m apart.
Care was taken to avoid contamination of the bio-slurry during the sampling process
so as to ensure accuracy.


The samples were collected in autoclaved bottles and sterilized containers, labelled,
stored, and transported to the laboratory in a cooler box (40C) and analyzed within
24 hours.
The samples were delivered to the NWSC Central Laboratory for the microbiological
and physicochemical laboratory analyses, and to the UCU Environmental Laboratory
for the pH adjustment property analyses of the agricultural lime.
3.4 Determination of the Microbiological and Physicochemical Properties of the
Bio-Slurry
Standard: NWSC Standard Operating Procedures (Freeman et al., 2021).
The purpose of this was to analyze the microbiological and physicochemical
properties of untreated bio-slurry to establish baseline data for assessing the impact
of agricultural lime treatment. This entailed the detection and quantification of
Escherichia coli (E.coli), Salmonella, Staphylococcus, Ascaris lumbricoides, Ascaris
lumbricoides eggs in the bio-slurry, and the measurement of the pH, Total
Phosphorous, Potassium, temperature, and Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) of the bioslurry.
3.4.1 Materials and Equipment
 Bio-slurry samples
 Selective media, namely, MacConkey agar, Salmonella-Shigella agar, Mannitol
salt agar
 Incubation equipment
 Autoclaved bottles and sterilized containers
 Petri dishes
 Pipettes


 pH meter
 Thermometer
 TDS meter
 Centrifuge
 Compound microscope
Research indicates that bio-slurry can contain significant levels of E.coli, Salmonella,
Staphylococcus, Ascaris lumbricoides eggs. This poses challenges for public health in
terms of human infection for those in direct contact with the bio-slurry, food
hygiene, and environmental health concerns (Drabe, 2024). Ascertaining the loads
of these respective pathogens was important for determining the required treatment
for their suppression.
Bio-slurry is rich in essential nutrients such as phosphorous and potassium. Studies
have shown that bio-slurry contains approximately 0.13% phosphorous and 0.12%
potassium on a wet basis and higher concentrations on a dry basis (Delhi, 2024).
Determining the initial composition of the nutrients in the bio-slurry was important
to compare with the composition after the treatment. This was an indicator of the
effectiveness of the treatment and viability of the bio-slurry after the treatment.
Bio-slurry generally has neutral to slightly alkaline pH (Delhi, 2024). Determining the
initial pH of the bio-slurry was essential for the analysis of the pH treatment to be
performed by the agricultural lime. After the treatment, the pH of the bio-slurry
was to return to the initial pH levels. This was important for application for
application of the bio-slurry as a fertilizer.



3.5 Determination of the pH Adjustment Properties of Agricultural Lime for
Pathogen Suppression in Bio-Slurry
Standard: NWSC Standard Operating Procedures (Freeman et al., 2021).
The determination of the pH adjustment properties of agricultural lime involved
qualitative analysis by means of the flame test technique to confirm the presence
of calcium ions (Safety, n.d.). Having confirmed the presence of calcium ions in the
agricultural lime, the ideal dosage for the required pH adjustment was performed
by jar test analysis (Freeman et al., 2021).
3.5.1 Materials and Equipment for the Flame Test
 Non-luminous flame burner
 Nichrome or platinum wire loop
 Concentrated Hydrochloric acid (HCl)
 Agricultural lime
The wire loop was cleaned by dipping it in concentrated HCl and holding it in the
flame until no color was observed. This removed contaminants that could have
interfered with the results.
The cleaned wire loop was moistened with HCl again and dipped into the agricultural
lime. The wire loop was then placed at the edge of a hot non-luminous flame.
The color of the flame was observed and recorded. The procedure was repeated in
triplicates with fresh samples.
The presence of calcium ions in agricultural lime was an indicator of the Calcium
Carbonate Equivalent (CCE) and pH adjustment properties of agricultural lime. The


calcium ions react with the bio-slurry forming hydroxyl ions which alkalinize the bioslurry and raise the pH (Schwab et al., 2007).
The flame test is a qualitative analytical technique that was used to confirm the
presence of calcium ions in agricultural lime based on the characteristic orange
flame emitted when heated in a non-luminous flame (Safety, n.d.). When metal ions
are introduced into a flame, they absorb energy which excites their electrons to
higher energy levels. As these excited electrons return to their ground state, they
release energy in the form of light. The wavelength and therefore the color of the
emitted light is specific to each metal ion due to the unique arrangement of
electrons and energy levels in the different elements (Safety, n.d.). An orange flame
confirmed calcium ions in the agricultural lime.
3.5.2 Materials and Equipment for the Jar Test
 Jar test equipment
 Bio-slurry samples
 Agricultural lime
 pH meter
 Electronic weighing scale
500mL of bio-slurry was poured into the jars.
The initial pH of the bio-slurry was measured and recorded.
Doses of agricultural lime; 0g, 10g, 20g, 30g, 40g, 50g, 60g were weighed and added
to the control jar, and jar 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 respectively. This allowed observation of
how varying amounts of agricultural lime adjusted the pH.


The jars were stirred thoroughly at a high speed of 150RPM for 5 minutes to ensure
even distribution of the agricultural lime. Immediately after the stirring speed was
reduced to 50RPM for 10 minutes.
The pH was measured and recorded immediately, and after 1 hour. The pH was then
measured and recorded after 24 hours for 7 days.
Data analysis was performed to identify which dose of agricultural lime achieved a
pH range of 9.0 – 10.0. Graphical analysis of the pH levels against time for the
different dosages was carried out.
According to Ziquin, P. et al, 2019, agricultural lime primarily operates by increasing
pH which suppresses the above mentioned pathogens in bio-slurry. Determining the
optimum dose of agricultural lime enabled maximization of pH increase while
minimizing potential negative impacts on the bio-slurry such as unnecessarily
prolonged alkalinity.
The jar test is a widely used laboratory method in water treatment and waste water
treatment to determine the optimal dosages for coagulation and pH adjustment.
The test facilitated simulation of full-scale treatment for pH adjustment (MWE,
2013).
3.6 Development of an Agricultural Lime Treatment Model for Pathogen
Suppression in Bio-Slurry
Standard: Exponential Decay Model, SAFL Baffle Design Guide (2023), Water Supply
Design Manual (2013) (Freeman et al., 2021; MWE, 2013; Objectives & Model, n.d.;
Revised, n.d.)


The development of an agricultural lime treatment model for pathogen suppression
in bio-slurry entailed model configuration, and model verification by experimental
analysis. Furthermore, a reactivation test analysis was performed to ascertain the
number of potent pathogenic microorganisms still present in the bio-slurry.
The exponential decay model Nt = N0e-kt shall be considered, where:
 Nt is the number of surviving pathogens
 N0 is the initial number of pathogens
 k is the death rate constant
 t is time
3.6.1 Considerations for the Development of the Model
The targets of the model were; to achieve pathogen suppression in bio-slurry to
concentrations below 400 CFU/100mL, to raise the pH of the bio-slurry to the range
between 9.0 and 10.0 and for the pH to return to neutral, to ensure that nutrient
levels remain adequate for subsequent agricultural use.
All relevant data for configuration of the model, that is, initial pathogen loads in
the bio-slurry, initial pH of the bio-slurry, optimum agricultural lime needed to
achieve pH range 9.0 – 10.0, initial bio-slurry nutrient composition, environmental
considerations namely temperature and rainfall.
Development of the model structure that entails input parameters, treatment
processes, and output parameters. The treatment process entailed agricultural lime
application by direct mixing based on the determined optimum dosage. The mixing
duration and intensity of the agricultural lime within the bio-slurry corresponded


with that determined during determination of pH adjustment properties of the
agricultural lime.
The pH changes and pathogen levels over time were monitored post treatment.
These output values after the observation time as determined were measured and
recorded.
Model evaluation was performed by analyzing the data collected during
implementation. This was performed by comparing the pretreatment and posttreatment data to assess changes in pH and pathogen loads.
3.6.2 Considerations for Verification of the Model
Bio-slurry samples were collected from MBPS and prepared to ensure consistency.
Optimum dose of agricultural lime determined was applied and uniformly mixed with
the bio-slurry to achieve effective treatment. A control group without agricultural
lime was set up and compared against treated samples.
pH levels and pathogen loads were measured after agricultural lime treatment after
the duration of time determined during the pH adjustment analysis.
Statistical analysis such as t-tests were performed to compare the predicted values
from the model with the actual measured values and the error matrix calculated.
Additional rounds of verification were performed with different bio-slurry samples
from MBPS.
The exponential decay model is suitable for the analysis of pathogen suppression
and degradation over time. The model gives an understanding of pathogen
population dynamics and their behavior and concentration levels over time


(Objectives & Model, n.d.). Verification of the model further optimized the
agricultural lime applications to enhance pathogen suppression (MWE, 2013).




CHAPTER FOUR
4.0 Results and Discussion
4.1 Introduction
This chapter discusses the findings from the laboratory analyses and the trends made
by comparison of the results obtained from quantification of the parameters of this
study. Analyses were conducted in accordance to the methods stated in the
preceding chapter and the findings were recorded. The process of interpretation,
analysis, and discussion of the results is done with respect to the specific objectives
of the research.
4.2 Results and Discussion: Determination of the Microbiological and
Physicochemical Properties of the Bio-Slurry
The microbiological and physicochemical properties of the untreated bio-slurry were
analyzed and this provided baseline data of the bio-slurry. This entailed the
detection
and
quantification
of
Escherichia
coli
(E.coli),
Salmonella,
Staphylococcus, Ascaris lumbricoides eggs in the bio-slurry, and the measurement of
pH, Total Phosphorous, Potassium, temperature, and TDS of the bio-slurry as shown
in Table 2.

Table 2 shows that the concentrations of Escherichia Coli and Ascaris lumbricoides
eggs in the bio-slurry are beyond standards for waste water discharge by NEMA
making it unsafe for use as a fertilizer and discharge into the environment, raising
critical public health and environmental concerns. The table further shows that the
pH of the bio-slurry is neutral.




Pathogen Contamination
1. E.coli
The concentration of E.coli exceeds permissible limits, this indicates that a
considerable quantity of pathogenic microorganisms survived in the bio slurry
after the anaerobic process of biogas generation. Studies in Bangladesh found
E.coli concentrations of (9.1x106-2.285x108 ) CFU/500ml in bio slurry derived
from human excreta ( Islam et al, 2019). Similarly, salmonella and helminth eggs
persisted and survived anaerobic digestion and proliferating post application,
though their concentrations comply with the permissible limits for discharge.
These bacteria can cause risks of water and soil contamination and are linked to
gastrointestinal infections and antibiotic resistance, emphasizing the need for
extended retention times or secondary treatment in order to suppress these
pathogens (Hearly et al, 2018).
2. Helminth eggs
Helminth eggs concentration exceeds standards for effluent discharge indicating
a high risk of soil-transmitted helminthiasis, from literature studies (Kumwenda
et al, 2018) of a similar case study in Senegal, reviews that the concentration of
helminth eggs was discovered to be reach 11500eggs/g in untreated bio slurry,
far surpassing WHO and NEMA limits (less than or equal to 1 egg). Ascaris
lumbricoides that have a low infectious dose of 10 eggs, they are particularly
resilient, can survive for months in soil and can survive even in harsh conditions,
this necessitates post treatment of bio slurry in order to in activate helminth
eggs before being released into the environment and for agricultural use (Amoah
et al, 2018).


3. Phosphorus Content
According to the standards for phosphorus in effluent discharge, that is 5mg/L,
the concentration found in the bio slurry at MBPS does not comply. While
phosphorus in bio slurry enhances soil fertility, excessive concentrations can
destabilize the aquatic ecosystem this is because when discharged into the
environment, bio slurry joins surface runoff during rains, gets deposited in
surface water bodies an poses a risk of eutrophication in these water bodies,
therefore treatment is required to reduce its concentration in bio slurry.(EPA,
2014);(Collard et al, 2020).
This data is helpful in informing the level of agricultural lime treatment required in
order to suppress the above mentioned pathogens to levels below the maximum
permissible limits. This in turn informs the dosage of the agricultural lime required
for pathogen suppression in bio-slurry and the pH adjustment required.
4.3 Results and Discussion: Determination of the pH Adjustment Properties of
the Agricultural Lime for Pathogen Suppression in Bio-Slurry
The determination of the pH adjustment properties of agricultural lime involved
qualitative analysis by means of the flame test technique to confirm the presence
of calcium ions (Safety, n.d.). Having confirmed the presence of calcium ions in the
agricultural lime, the ideal dosage for the required pH adjustment was performed
by jar test analysis.




4.3.1 Flame Test Results and Discussion
The flame color observed was Orange (Figure 1).

Figure 1: Orange flame from agricultural lime
The flame test was a qualitative analytical technique that was used to confirm the
presence of calcium ions in agricultural lime. Calcium ion is directly related to the
neutralizing value of a material, the higher the neutralizing value, the higher the
capability of creating alkaline conditions (Schwab et al., 2007).
The confirmation calcium ions in agricultural lime is evidenced by a bright orange
flame, when the agricultural lime is subjected to an open flame or source of heat
(Safety, n.d.).
When calcium ions are introduced into a flame, the heat from the flame excites the
electrons in the calcium ions to higher energy levels. When these excited electrons
return to their ground state, they release energy in the form of light at specific
wavelengths, producing the characteristic color of bright orange flame. (Safety,
n.d.), hence confirming presence of calcium ions.


4.3.2 Jar Test Results and Discussion
The optimum dosage of agricultural lime for pathogen suppression was determined
(Figure 2). The pH variation over days in bio-slurry containing the optimum dosage
was also determined (Figure 3).

Figure 2: The effect of agricultural lime dosage on pH values in bio-slurry (after 3
days)




Figure 3: pH variation over days in bio-slurry containing the dosage of 60g/500mL.
The initial pH was 7.9
Figure 2 suggests that the ideal agricultural lime dosage was 60g/500mL given that
it resulted in a pH range between 9.0 – 10.0 after three days. Research suggests that
this range would suppress pathogen activity and result in reduced concentrations of
the pathogenic microorganisms in the bio-slurry. The dosage determined would
inform the amount of agricultural lime required to treat the bio-slurry released from
MBPS daily.
Figure 3 suggests that with 60g/500mL, the pH of the bio-slurry raises from neutral
to the range of 9.0 – 10.0 and back to neutral within a period of seven days. This
suggests that within seven days from treatment the bio-slurry would be safe for
discharge into the environment and for use as a fertilizer.


Both findings suggest that the preliminary design of the treatment unit for pathogen
suppression in bio-slurry using agricultural lime should put into consideration the
required amounts of agricultural lime, the given daily volume of bio-slurry released,
adequate mixing of the agricultural lime and the bio-slurry, and sufficient contact
time of not less than 7days to facilitate the treatment.
This analysis is still ongoing so as to determine the daily concentrations of the
pathogenic microorganisms during the course of agricultural lime treatment from
day zero to day seven. This will better inform the treatment and the preliminary
design.

Figure 4 results of physicochemical and micro biological properties of bio slurry
treated with agricultural lime
1. Reduction of pathogenic microorganisms (E.coli and salmonella)
The reduction of E.coli and salmonella shows the effectiveness of agricultural lime
against pathogenic microorganisms. The application of agricultural lime raises pH
creating inhospitable environments for pathogens, reducing their concentrations to
that that is safe for the environment and agricultural use. Studies have
demonstrated lime stabilization can significantly reduce pathogenic microorganism
concentrations in bio slurry, achieving levels that are deemed safe for land


application according to standards. This is achieved through protein denaturing and
membrane disruption: hydroxyl ions disrupt bacterial cell membranes through
saponification of lipids this is enhanced by the oxidative stress from reactive oxygen
species generated at high pH hence denaturing the cellular proteins, disrupting
membrane integrity leading to inactivation of the microorganism.
2. Persistence of Helminth Eggs
The results show that helminth eggs persisted in the treated bio slurry. Helminth
eggs, particularly Ascaris lumbricoides exhibit remarkable resilience to alkaline
conditions given their structural resistance make of a three layered shell that shields
the embryos from pH extremes, allowing them to remain viable for extended time
periods even after the treatment process. A study reported that using lime for
treatment of bio slurry that contained helminth eggs, reduced the number of these
eggs by 53-56% but the viable eggs constituted to 44-53% of the total count. This
indicates the need for additional or alternative treatment methods to achieve
complete inactivation of helminth eggs (carlos. L.F, et al, 2023)
3. Increase in Phosphorus Concentrations
The results show that the concentrations of phosphorus increased after treatment
of the bio slurry, this can be attributed to several factors; agricultural lime induced
pH elevation can lead to the of organic phosphorus compounds becoming soluble in
bio slurry, converting them into readily available inorganic forms. While this
enhances the nutrient value of the bio slurry as a bio fertilizer, excessive phosphorus
levels pose environmental risks notably eutrophication of water bodies due to run
offs. Despite the fact that treatment of bio slurry with agricultural lime reduces
