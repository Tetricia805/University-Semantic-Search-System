The purpose of this study was to investigate the mediating role of employee engagement in the relationship
between HR practices and OCB in soft drink firms in Uganda. Quantitative cross-sectional survey design (N =
210) examined the relationship between nine HR practices (antecedents), employee engagement and OCB.
Hypotheses were tested through correlation and hierarchical regression. All the nine antecedent variables studied
were significantly related to employee engagement and employee engagement was significantly related to OCB.
The hierarchical regression analysis results shows that five antecedent variables demonstrated a significant
relationship with OCB - role clarity, collaboration, job security, compensation fairness, and development. This
research has validated the organizational citizenship behaviour model, extended the engagement model and
social exchange theory and established that all the nine antecedents studied were related to engagement but only
five were significantly related to OCB.
