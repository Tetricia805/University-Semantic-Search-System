Prev Lecture..
q Scientific Writing: A specialized form of writing used to communicate
research findings, ideas, and knowledge in a clear, precise, and
objective way. It is the standard style used in research papers, theses,
dissertations, technical reports, and journal articles.
qMain features
q Clarity and Precision
qObjectivity
qStructure and Organization, e.g. IMRaD: Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion.
qEvidence-based (Literature Review)
qFormal Tone
qConciseness
qConsistency and Accuracy

Literature Review - Introduction
qA literature review is a structured summary and
evaluation of what has already been written and
researched on a particular topic.
It is not just a list of sources—it is a critical synthesis
that:
• Explains what is already known.
• Highlights gaps, debates, and trends.
• Shows how your research fits into the bigger picture.

Why Literature Review?
qPurpose of a Literature Review
1.Context → Places your research in relation to what has
already been studied.
2.Evaluation → Assesses the quality and relevance of existing
studies.
3.Identification of Gaps → Shows what is missing or
underexplored.
4.Justification → Provides a rationale for why your study is
needed.
5.Framework → Helps you refine research questions, methods,
and theoretical foundation.

Types of Literature Review
qNarrative/Traditional → A broad summary without
strict methods.
qSystematic → A highly structured, comprehensive,
and replicable review.
qScoping → Explores the extent and nature of research
on a topic.
qCritical → Goes beyond description to analyze and
critique methods, findings, and assumptions.

Steps to doing Literature Review
qSearch → Use academic databases (Scopus, Web of Science, Google
Scholar, IEEE, etc.).
qSelect → Apply inclusion/exclusion criteria to filter relevant studies.
qRead Critically → Ask: What’s the purpose? What methods are used?
What are the strengths/limitations?
qOrganize → Group studies into themes (e.g., by method, theory,
findings, or chronology).
qSynthesize → Compare and contrast, find connections, and highlight
differences.
qWrite → Present a logical narrative that builds toward your research
gap.

Characteristics of a Good Literature Review
qFocused: Stays relevant to the research
problem/topic.
qCritical: Evaluates, doesn’t just summarize.
qOrganized: Flows by theme/idea, not by article.
qCurrent: Covers up-to-date works. Less than 8Years
qBalanced: Includes multiple perspectives.

Example
qTopic: Predictive Maintenance using Machine Learning
• Descriptive: “Many studies have used machine
learning for predictive maintenance in
manufacturing.”
• Critical: “While several studies (e.g., X, Y, Z) apply
machine learning to predictive maintenance, most rely
on small datasets and lack real-time validation. Few
studies integrate domain knowledge with ML models,
leaving a gap in practical applicability.”

Note to remember
q“understanding literature review”
means realizing it is not just about
reading and summarizing articles—it’s
about connecting, critiquing, and
synthesizing them to create a
foundation for your own research

Activity
Select a topic and conduct a systematic literature review
following the PRISMA protocol
qPRISMA = (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses)
qTo be done individually, but each member should present and discuss with
groupmates.
qNo repetition of topics among groupmates groups
qA 3-page review paper should be prepared (in Latex with proper referencing an
use of tools)
qDraft paper 1 – 8th October 2025
qFinal Paper Wednesday 15th October 2025)
qPoster presentation ( Friday 17th October 2025)
