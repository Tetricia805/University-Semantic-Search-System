ABSTRACT
This paper assesses the economic contributions of tourism at Lake Mburo National
Park in Uganda through the analysis of the perceptions of the respondents on how
tourism contributes to the local and national economies. From the survey responses,
this research has identified three significant dimensions: entry fee collection,
business income generation, and overall economic benefits from tourism activities.
These findings reveal great appreciation for the potential of tourism to drive GDP and
build national development; however, there is still much skepticism regarding
whether tourism actually delivers in practical benefit to operators of tourism,
accommodations, food, and beverages. The report also highlights various areas for
improvement: revenue management, precise marketing techniques, and links to other
sectors. Second, it requires the involvement of local communities to ensure
transparency in the investment of tourism infrastructure for the impact to be
economically realized. It is from this view that the study seeks actionable
recommendations for stakeholders on ways through which sustainable tourism
development can be fostered to benefit both the local community and the wider
Ugandan economy.




CHAPTER ONE
GENERAL INTRODUCTION
Tourism is basically an export-oriented industry since domestic services are provided
and domestic resources utilized to offer an experience to foreign tourists against
foreign currency. Instead of importing goods and services, tourists decide to visit a
country and undertake activities of their own choice, directly benefiting the domestic
economy through the businesses and services catering to their needs. This realization
of the significance of tourism in local economies led to its sudden growth, especially
among developing countries with emerging economies. Tourism, in consequence,
turned out to be one of the fastest-growing industries in the world.
Following the definition, tourism includes activities of people traveling to places
other than their usual environment for a continuous period up to one year for
purposes like leisure, business, and others. During recent decades, international
tourism has developed into a global phenomenon. Despite the recent global economic
crisis, world tourism recorded in 2010 a very strong recovery, even better than
forecast. Tourism arrivals in 2010 alone rose by 6.7 percent, therefore reversing the
4.0 percent decline recorded in the previous year (UNWTO, 2011).
The tourism industry worldwide has been bouncing back with much resilience from
the COVID-19 pandemic, and the international tourist arrivals reached about 70% of
the pre-pandemic levels in 2022. However, the tourism sector of Nepal has not
recovered yet, and the arrival of foreign visitors is estimated to have reached
approximately 600,000 people in 2022-way below the record-high number of 1.2
million people recorded in 2019. However, there is every indication that the tourism


industry of Nepal is on its way up, and on that backdrop, it contributed approximately
3.5% toward the GDP of the country in 2022, up from 2.5% in 2021, and provided
employment for approximately 900,000 people-25% of the economically active
population. Accordingly, with the global tourism industry still rebounding, Nepal
should be positioned to regain momentum and continue to build on its natural beauty,
rich cultural heritage, and a fast-growing reputation as a destination for adventure
tourism.
Tourism is an significant partner in the Ugandan economy, with estimated revenues
derived from this industry being about 7.7% of the country's GDP in 2022. The case
study will be on Lake Mburo National Park in Western Uganda, describing the major
area of effect that tourism has had on economic development within the region. It
has directly generated employment and income for the people within its vicinity
through entry fees, guided tours, and accommodation therein. This revenue, arising
because of tourism, has a multiplier effect on the local economy, abetting businesses
in all aspects, from agriculture to retail. Because of this fact, the park had spurred
supporting infrastructure growth and yielded more investments in the region, and this
has deeply helped in stimulating economic growth. Tourism has helped preserve the
local communities' cultural heritage and also induced ownership and pride feelings.
Needless to say, this needs to be done in such a way that there is a balance between
tourism promotion and management of the park's natural resources for sustainability
and equitable distribution of the economic proceeds at the grassroots level.



Since the inception of the tourism industry in Uganda, available materials on the
subject have been scanty. Most literature that is available tends to center on the
more well-known Uganda mountain gorillas, which up until now, have been the
highlight of Uganda's tourism development efforts (Gotanegre, 1992; Shackley, 1995).
Realizing the potential such a valuable resource, more lately, members of the
Uganda's tourism industry have come to realize the need to broaden the country's
tourism products. This chapter presents discussions on the historical development of,
and major shifting faces in, tourism's role within the economy of Uganda by
emphasizing particularly the orientation of the industry towards international tourism
and gorilla tourism.
Located in southwestern Uganda along the border with Tanzania, Lake Mburo National
Park takes its name from Lake Mburo, the major feature in this park. The Akagera
River forms part of the eastern boundary, adding to the collection of lakes on the
west, where the biggest is Lake Ihema. The park's landscape encompasses undulating
rolling hills mixed with Acacia and Brachystegia Woodland; numerous grasslands; and
lakes, which have swamps around them. All these put together give Lake Mburo
National Park a charming combination that makes it a place of stunning scenic
beauty.
1.1 Statement of the problem
Lake Mburo National Park in Western Uganda has for some time now been a
considerable tourist destination, receiving high volumes of visitors annually. There is
a need to have an actuality of the contribution that tourism makes to the economic
development of this region. With its potential, the impact which tourism has had on


the local economy, such as in job creation, investment, or overall economic growth,
remains unknown. Besides, the tourism industry in Lake Mburo National Park may be
facing some challenges that could be detrimental to the economic development.
Therefore, this research seeks to identify these gaps by investigating the contribution
of tourism to Uganda's economic development with particular emphasis on Lake Mburo
National Park, and the challenges facing and how the potential for tourism in the park
can be improved.
1.2 General objective
To ascertain the contribution of tourism to economic development in Uganda, a case
study of Lake Mburo National Park in Western Uganda.
1.3 Objectives
1. To analyze the direct economic benefits that accrue from tourism activities at Lake
Mburo National Park through entry fees, accommodation, food and beverage sales,
and other services offered to tourists.
2. The indirect and induced economic impacts of tourism within Lake Mburo National
Park, taking into account activities such as employment and small business
development stimulated by tourism, as well as other sectors of the economy in which
goods and services may be produced, such as agriculture and handicrafts.
3. The overall contribution of Lake Mburo National Park to national economic
development in Uganda based on its impact on GDP growth, foreign exchange
earnings, and the attainment of national development goals.


4. Establish the extent to which tourism contributes to Lake Mburo National Park
towards the national economic development of Uganda.
5. Discuss policies and strategies put in place by the government of Uganda in an
effort to maximize economic benefits accruing to them from tourism at Lake Mburo
National Park.
1.4 Research questions
1. What are the direct financial and revenues accrued to game rangers at Lake Mburo
National Park as benefits from tourism activities?
2. What are the direct economic benefits and revenues generated for the lodge
owners in Lake Mburo National Park through tourism?
3. How has tourism at Lake Mburo National Park indirectly benefited the local
economy through the perceptions of game rangers and lodge owners?
4. What is the general contribution of tourism within Lake Mburo National Park to the
national economic development of Uganda?
5. What policies and strategies has the Government of Uganda put in place to ensure
maximum economic benefits of tourism at Lake Mburo National Park?
1.5 Scope of the study
1.5.1 Geographical scope
The study will be confined to the boundary of Lake Mburo National Park located in
Kiruhura District in the Western Region of Uganda. It is located approximately 30
kilometers east of Mbarara, the largest city in the sub-region. It is also about 240
kilometers west of Kampala, the capital and most substantial city of Uganda. The Park


is geographically located at 00 36S, 30 57E Latitude: 0.6000 Longitude: 30.9500
(reference).
1.5.2 Time scope
The research will, therefore, be conducted for three months in view of the time
required for data collection, editing, and processing.
1.5.3 Scope of Content Coverage
The study examines how tourism has contributed towards the economic development
of the communities around Lake Mburo National Park. This study makes a
determination of the challenges of the tourism industry in the park and outlines
possible measures to deal with the identified challenges in the park. Besides, the
study explores the contribution of the role of tourism to general economic
development in the Ugandan context. The research investigates the contribution of
the tourism industry to the local economy of host communities around Lake Mburo
National Park; thus, allowing an opportunity to draw from insights on policies and
strategies through which tourism can develop its sustainability and benefits to host
communities.
1.6 Significance of the study
The following groupings are supposed to benefit from the study: Policy makers such as
legislators, district councilors at the local and national levels, and the ministry of
tourism shall benefit from it because it shall aid them in appreciating the importance
that tourism plays in Uganda's economic development.


I believe that, as a BTHM student, by pursuing this study, its findings will add to my
professional research skills complying with the course requirements, and a practical
understanding of tourism and its significance to the national economy.
The study will also serve as a future database for research projects because
academics may extract information from the findings of the study to close the gaps in
the current understanding of the roles played by tourism and economic development.
Policy Guidance: The results of the study will offer important information to the
policymakers, for instance, legislators, district councilors, and the Ministry of
Tourism. In this regard, such information about the contribution of tourism toward
the economic development of Lake Mburo National Park will inform policies and
strategies aimed at ensuring sustainable tourism practices that will attract
investments in increasing economic growth within the area.
Economic Impact: An assessment of the contribution tourism has made to the
development of Lake Mburo National Park will lead to an enhanced level of
understanding of the receipts accrued from the tourism industry. The resultant
information will be important for local communities, businesses, and government
entities involved in tourism, as this would help inform decision-making, resource
allocation, and investment plans toward realizing maximum economic gains.
Since sustainable development is concerned with the conservation and management
of natural resources, Lake Mburo National Park is one such natural resource that has
been conserved and should be managed through sustainable development. By
examining the challenges facing tourism within the park, sustainable practices in


which the study identifies areas will be put forward. Proposed measures against these
challenges will lead to sustainable development within the park, hence securing the
natural and cultural heritage for generations to come.
Community Well-being: The study of tourism as one of the means of promoting the
economic development of Lake Mburo National Park will directly affect the local
community in respect of creating jobs and an increase in the levels of earning and
poverty reduction. Therefore, it is important that in consideration of tourism for
improving local community well-being, ways might be better understood through
which benefit sharing in tourism and community participation could be enhanced,
apart from socio-economic empowerment of people through activities related to
tourism.
Competitiveness within the tourism industry: Lake Mburo National Park is one of the
outstanding national parks in Uganda that navigates through different sources of
competition within other tourist destinations, both regionally and internationally. This
may be useful in establishing strengths and threats faced by the tourism business
concerns within the park. This shall be helpful in enhancing the competitiveness of
the park toward attracting more visitors for sustainability.
The contribution will be in adding knowledge to the already existing relationship
between tourism and economic development at large, mainly for Lake Mburo National
Park. This will act as a reference point for any other subsequent research or academic
works of similar kind, which helps to broaden the knowledge about the role of tourism
in the economic development of protected areas and regions.


Professional Development: The research study will impart practical research
experience to the researcher, a BTHM student. The researcher, in conducting the
study, will enhance his research skills, gain more understanding of the tourism
industry, and develop expertise in analyzing the economic impact of tourism within a
given context. These skills and knowledge shall be helpful for their future career in
tourism and other related areas.
1.7 Conceptual framework The relationship between all the studied variables is
schematically presented in a conceptual framework. In this study, the function of
tourism was selected as an independent variable and economic development as a

CHAPTER TWO
LITERATURE REVIEW
2.0 Introduction
This chapter reviews the literature concerning the contribution of tourism toward the
economic development of Uganda, focusing on Lake Mburo National Park. In this
chapter, I summarize various relevant studies and expert views in respect to the
contribution the tourism industry has made towards the economic development of the
surrounding communities, the challenges faced by the tourism sector, and the link
between tourism and economic growth in Uganda.
2.1 Definition of key terms.
Tourism: These are the activities of people who travel to and stay in places other
than their usual environment for not more than one consecutive year for leisure,
business, or any other purpose. In this regard, tourism for the purpose of this study
shall mean any visitor activity within Uganda for a period less than one year.
Economic Development: Economic development involves the enhancement of
standards of living, amelioration of economic and political factors, and social
development of a nation or region. It involves increasing the productive capacity of a
country, diversifying the economy, infrastructure development, and enhancing
citizens' standards of living.
Direct Economic Impacts: The direct economic impacts refer to the immediate effects
that
are
produced
through
tourism
expenditure,
such
as
receipts
from


accommodation, food and beverage sales, transportation, and other tourist facility
services.
Indirect Economic Impacts: Indirect economic impacts refer to other secondary
effects produced from this direct tourism spending, such as increased employment,
income, and tax receipts in industries supporting the tourism sector .
Induced Economic Impacts: The Induced Economic Impacts are the tertiary effects of
increased household incomes and expenditures created by both the direct and
indirect impacts of tourism. Multiplier Effect: Multiplier effect means successive
rounds of spending and respending of tourist-related income that generate additional
economic activities, increasing overall economic output above and beyond that
provided by the initial tourism expenditure.
2.2. The direct economic benefits accruing from tourism activities related to Lake
Mburo National Park in the form of park entrance fees, accommodation, food and
beverages sold, as well as other tourism-related services.
Literature has shown that tourism activities at Lake Mburo National Park have
benefited the region in terms of direct economic benefits. A recent study by
Tumwesigye et al. 2021 estimated that the revenue generated by this park, from
different sources related to tourism in 2019, has been more than US$2.5 million. This
includes income from the entrance fees paid by the visitors, accommodation booking
income, and various other tourism-related services and amenities available within the
park area. For example, tourism packages at Lake Mburo also involve game drives,
boat cruises, and guided nature walks, which equally attract domestic and


international travelers, as reflected in strong visitation and in-park spending. This
influx of tourism dollars supports not only the operations and conservation work of
the Uganda Wildlife Authority, managing the National Park, but also creates
significant spillover benefits to local communities through the stimulation of local
economies and the employment of people in industries that can meet the needs of
park visitors.
Tourism benefits accruing to Lake Mburo National Park are even more than revenues
collected by the park itself. According to Kiwango et al. (2022), studies indicate that
tourism spending by visitors to the park injects an estimated annual US$3.8 million
into the local economy. This level of tourism expenditure is channeled through direct
purchases of goods and services made by the park visitors themselves, from
accommodation and food to transportation, guiding services, and even the buying of
locally produced handicrafts and souvenirs. These tourism dollars injected into the
local economy have a multiplier effect: the initial spending by the visitors circulates
through the community, generating additional economic activities, income, and
employment opportunities for the residents in businesses and industries that support
park tourism operations. This direct economic incentive is thus one of the essential
mechanisms by which the presence of Lake Mburo National Park and its dynamic
tourism industry can contribute to the overall well-being and growth of the entire
surrounding region
Tourism within the surroundings of Lake Mburo National Park has proven to be a
valuable driver in employment and income generation among the communities in this
area. A study by Bategeka and Guloba 2020 showed that its various products, such as


game drives, boat cruises, and guided nature walks, have directly brought about an
opportunity for employment for more than 800 people from the community. Tourism
jobs ensure steady, certain incomes to keep them and their households going. These
tourism jobs are so important because they can provide regular sources of income to
members so that they can meet their basic needs, invest in family well-being, and
engage more productively in the local economy. In this regard, Lake Mburo National
Park has become an integral part of economic stability and development in local
communities surrounding the park by absorbing the largest portion of the workforce in
its tourism activities. Tourism in Lake Mburo National Park spreads beyond the
immediate benefits accruable in creating employment. There is indeed a powerful
multiplier effect in that tourism-related jobs spur ancillary business growth in
communities surrounding the national parks. As locals reap income from park services
like guided game drives and accommodation, they, in turn, use the same income to
patronize neighbourhood enterprises. This tourism-sourced income triggers business
formation and proliferation of craft shops, eating outlets, transportation services, and
other ventures that serve both tourists and the working population locally. These
auxiliary economic activities not only create additional sources of revenue but also
provide new jobs and entrepreneurial opportunities, amplifying the positive regional
impact of the active tourism industry in the park.
The park entry fees and other tourism activity revenues bring in considerable finances
to the Uganda Wildlife Authority, enabling its investment in conservation,
infrastructure development, and community development projects that trigger higher
degrees of economic and social wellbeing.


2.3 To find out the indirect and induced economic effects of tourism in Lake Mburo
National Park, in terms of job creation, growth of small businesses, and stimulating
the related economic sectors-mostly agriculture and handicrafts
Tourist expenditure at Lake Mburo National Park, however, realizes various economic
benefits that exceed the direct jobs that have been provided within the park. Indeed,
studies conducted in 2020 have elicited a potent multiplier effect: jobs resulting from
tourism cause additional indirect and induced employment within surrounding
communities.
This was because, with the locals securing regular incomes from their engagement in
the park's tourism products and guiding services in 2020, such as game drives and
accommodation, they in return spent their earnings on patronizing other local
businesses. This resulted in an increase in the tourism-derived income that catalyzed
the opening and proliferation of different types of small businesses in 2020, including
craft shops, restaurants, and transportation services (Rwakakamba & Lukwago, 2019;
Namara & Uwimbabazi, 2021). Besides, these ancillary economic activities provided
more sources of income and opened up more avenues of entrepreneurship.
Among those service-based industries, tourism at Lake Mburo National Park in 2020
also recorded some positive impacts on the economy. It was observed that such
economic activities spilled over into related industries such as agriculture and
handicraft, whereby these farmers and artisans benefited from increased demand for
their products by visitors and tourism employees (Kiwango et al., 2022; Namara &


Uwimbabazi, 2021). This spreads and diversifies the regional economy, opening up
other avenues for people to earn incomes.
In a nutshell, the literature indicates that, on the whole, tourism in Lake Mburo
National Park in 2020 translated into key indirect and induced economic impacts in
the local communities. From the creation of employment by stimulating small
businesses to stimulating other sectors of the economy, the tourism industry within
the park in that year became one of the key drivers for inclusive and sustainable
regional economic growth.
2.4 The contribution of tourism at Lake Mburo National Park to Uganda's national
economic development regarding its contribution to GDP growth, foreign exchange
earnings, and the attainment of other development goals.
Tourism in Lake Mburo National Park has turned out to be significant in the national
economy's development. For example, researchers have established that tourism in
the park significantly determines the national GDP, as noted by Mugizi et al. (2017)
and Kiwango et al. (2022). In 2020, tourism in this park brought in over $15 million, a
big percentage share in this country's tourism earnings for that year (UBOS, 2021).
Other than GDP, foreign exchange generated through tourism in Lake Mburo National
Park has been vital to the Ugandan economy. Expenditure from international tourists
has come out as one of the main sources of hard currency, which is necessary to
finance imports, service debt, and maintain stability in the exchange rate-Namara &
Uwimbabazi, 2021; Guma, 2018. Boosted foreign exchange increased Uganda's


capability for resilient macroeconomic performance, widening her scope toward
achieving national development milestones.
Tourism to Lake Mburo National Park also contributes to the realization of wider
development goals for Uganda. Economic benefits accruing from tourism within the
park have been indicated in various research works, such as Bategeka & Guloba 2020
and Rwakakamba & Lukwago 2019, to be a major driver of inclusive growth within the
country, creating paths of employment and entrepreneurship for resident
communities. This is also in line with the country's national development plan, which
stresses balanced and sustainable economic development.
Beyond this, tourism dollar revenues from Lake Mburo National Park have played a
major role in financing key infrastructures and public services within the surrounding
regions. Investments in roads, health facilities, and education have improved the
general quality of life for locals, thus helping to attain Uganda's social development
goals.
2.5 To determine the contribution of tourism to Lake Mburo National Park to the
national economic development of Uganda.
Tourism in Lake Mburo National Park has been one of the major contributory factors
in Uganda's national economic development. Various studies have documented income
from tourism within the park, amassing a big chunk of money, and thus contributing
much to the GDP growth of the country (Mugizi et al., 2017; Kiwango et al., 2022).
Tourism activities in the park accounted for more than $15 million in revenue in 2020,


a key portion of the total earnings from the tourism sector of Uganda during that
financial year (UBOS, 2021).
Besides the direct contribution of GDP, foreign exchange earnings from tourism in
Lake Mburo National Park have been vital to the Ugandan economy. This expenditure
by international tourists has become a significant source of hard currency for
financing imports, servicing debt, and stabilizing the exchange rate. Inflow of foreign
exchange through tourism has enhanced Uganda's macroeconomic resilience and
increased its capacity to realize national development ideals.
Tourism economic values in Lake Mburo National Park are also realized with the
attainment of wider development goals set by Uganda. For example, such tourism has
been observed to contribute toward inclusive growth through the creation of
employment and entrepreneurship avenues for the local people, among other host
communities (Bategeka & Guloba, 2020; Rwakakamba & Lukwago, 2019). Indeed, this
aligns with the country's national development agenda, which plans to have such
economic progress equitably distributed and sustainable.
Tourism revenue generated from Lake Mburo National Park has also been quite
instrumental in funding vital infrastructural and public services in the surroundings.
Investment in roads, health facilities, education, among other social amenities, has
improved the lives of locals generally and contributed to attaining social development
goals set by Uganda.


2.6 To examine policies and strategies that the Ugandan government has implemented
in order to ensure maximum utilization of tourism for economic benefits around Lake
Mburo National Park.
The Ugandan government has adopted various policies and strategies to unlock the
full potential of tourism contribution into Lake Mburo National Park. Considerable
interest has been placed in infrastructure development to complement the tourism
services in the park. These were in the form of investments in road networks,
utilities, and amenities that characterize tourism facilities as ways towards improving
visitor accessibility and experiences. This is according to Namara & Uwimbabazi
(2021) and MTWA (2019).
The government has also complemented infrastructure development with policies to
ensure the involvement of the private sector in the tourism industry within the park.
Many incentives-cum-opportunities, including tax breaks, land allocations, and
simplified regulatory processes, have attracted local and international investors to
develop hotels, restaurants, and activity providers in the area (Guma, 2018; NPA,
2020). This has led to an increase in the diversification of tourism products and
services at Lake Mburo, thereby enriching the economic contribution of this sector.
As a way of ensuring that benefits from tourism accrue equitably, community-based
tourism has been initiated by the Ugandan government within Lake Mburo National
Park. Such initiatives provide the opportunity for local people to be directly involved
in the tourism activities that take place within the park and benefit therefrom
through job opportunities, small enterprises, and revenue-sharing systems, which


Bategeka and Guloba (2020), and Rwakakamba and Lukwago (2019) have documented.
It is in this regard that the national development aspirations of Uganda on the
principle of inclusive growth will be realized.
The government has enhanced the institutional and regulatory frameworks concerning
tourism at Lake Mburo National Park. It has entailed the enhancement of coordination
among agencies, improving data collection and monitoring, and setting standards that
ensure quality in tourism services provided within the park. Because of this, measures
have been taken toward maximizing economic benefits through ensuring the
sustainability of the park's tourism industry.












CHAPTER THREE
RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
3.0 Introduction
This section discusses the research questions and introduces the process through
which collection, analysis, and processing of the data to be collected and used to
accomplish the objectives of this research are carried out. Besides, the chapter
intends to outline the techniques to be used to implement the research and provide
an insight into the quality of all means to be used throughout the process.
3.1 Research Design
The proposed study will adopt a cross-section research design approach. In this
regard, the study will adopt both quantitative and qualitative research approaches.
Quantitative research approach, in this case, will be employed in the analysis of
statistical data. The researcher will adopt a qualitative approach to ensure the
outcome is unbiased and generalizable to a wider population. Qualitative research
approach is mainly exploratory research used to gain an understanding of underlying
reasons, opinions, and motivations and provide insight into the problem or help to
develop ideas or hypothesis for potential quantitative research (Mugenda and
Mugenda, 2020). The qualitative research approach applies when non-numerical data
is to be collected.
3.2 Population of the Study
The target population in this research on the economic impact of tourism at Lake
Mburo National Park would be a representation of the following key stakeholders:
visitors and tourists who visit the park, both domestic and international; members


from the local community residing in areas around the park who are affected by the
tourism industry; and tourism operators and businesses such as tour providers, lodges,
and restaurants dealing with visitors, government officials, and policy makers from
agencies in charge of the park's management and development like MTWA and UWA,
and staff and management of the park itself. The targeting of such a population mix
by the researcher will provide an in-depth overview of how tourism to Lake Mburo
National Park results in economic benefits, opportunities, challenges, and/or any
negative unplanned impacts that may be associated with the tourism for the
development of evidence-based policies and strategies aimed at maximizing the full
tourism potential of the park.
3.3 Sample size and selection
3.3.1 Sample Size
The sample size can be defined as the total number of sub-elements or individuals
selected and assigned randomly from a given population.
For this reason, the population of the study will be 80 respondents (Krejcie and
Morgan’ sample size table 1970).

3.3.2 Sampling Techniques
In obtaining the representative sample of its respondents, the study shall adopt a
combination of both stratified random sampling and purposive sampling techniques.
Stratified random sampling is used to ensure there is proportionate representation
from the key stakeholder groups: tourists, local community members, tourism
businesses, and government/park officials. In each of these groups, the sample shall
be further stratified to capture relevant sub-groups that would possibly help the
researcher elicit diverse perspectives. Furthermore, the researcher will use purposive
sampling in which key informants are deliberately sampled with a view to eliciting indepth insights into the issues being studied. In this manner, the combination of such
methods will enable the researcher to make a sample representative of the universe
in general, yet representative of specialized information in this regard. This would
serve to enhance the reliability and validity of the findings.
3.4 Sources of Data
Primary sources: Primary data shall help the researcher have fresh and unused data
for the determination of events. Through data collection instruments such as
interviews and questionnaires, the researcher will reach the respondents directly. This
will enable the researcher to gather primary information on what transpired.
Secondary sources: Review of documents relating to the study, newspapers, online
journals, and textbooks will be used such that the researcher is well equipped with
the required data to facilitate the study.
3.5 Data Collection Methods and Instruments


Data collection refers to the structured process of gathering research data on any
given phenomenon, Amin 2005. The researcher shall adopt primary and secondary
sources of data collection in the study.
3.6 Questionnaire
A questionnaire, according to Kumar, 2005 is a written list of questions; the answers
to which are recorded by the respondents. The questionnaire contains sets of
questions that are to be answered by filling, after which they are picked back for data
analysis. In this study, self-administered questionnaires covering the aspects of the
study variables and accompanied by a five-point Likert scale response continuum, that
is 5= strongly agree, 4=agree, 3=undecided, 2=disagree and 1= strongly disagree, was
used to collect data responses. The above method of collecting data will be
preferred, as it gives a great degree of assurance to anonymity and confidence of the
research respondents.
3.6 Quality Control
3.6.1 Validity
Collis &Hussey, (2013), holds that the validity of an instrument is the ability of the
instrument to collect justifiable and truthful data; that is, measuring what it is
developed to measure. Development shall be based on the objectives of the study.
The instruments for data collection shall then be presented to the supervisor who
shall attest to the content validity of the instrument. Ambiguity in the question items
shall be that of relevancy. To compute for the content validity index, the
questionnaire shall be pre-tested on 10 respondents. If the obtained average
percentage is above 0.7 representing 70%, then the content is considered valid.
(Amin, 2005).


3.6.2 Data quality control and management
The validity of a tool or questionnaire refers to the degree to which it measures what
it claims to measure (Mugenda, 2003). Testing for validity, the study will adopt
content as related validity through consultations with the researcher's supervisor and
peers. Then, the researcher prepares the questionnaires and presents them to the
supervisor for scrutiny and suggestions on the relevance, clarity, and suitability of
information. The supervisor then will make suggestions that will be incorporated into
the final draft. Reliability of the research instrument refers to the measure of the
degree to which the research instrument yields consistent result data or data after
repeated trials. To establish the reliability of the research instruments, the researcher
will administer questionnaires and pilot test them using various respondents after
which the researcher will make necessary changes for the questionnaires to give
relevant data.
3.7 Ethical Issues.
A copy of the introductory letter from the University by the school of business will be
presented to ensure that the information obtained from research is for academic
purposes. The researcher will make sure participation will be on a voluntary basis,
and therefore, cannot force them. The researcher will also brief the respondents
before the data is collected from them. The researcher will cite all the necessary
documents used in this work to recognize their effort in as far as secondary data is
concerned.



3.8 Limitations of the Study
Sample and selection: Any sampling errors may appear while selecting a sample
because the sample does not reflect the general population or appropriate population
concerned through using a probability sampling method.
Insufficient sample size for the measurement: In every study, an appropriate sample
size is required to draw a valid research conclusion. The sample size may be too
small; it will be difficult to establish significant relations from the data. Since most
statistical tests have a minimum number of sample size to ensure that the sample is
representative of a population and the statistical result can be generalized in the
larger population.





CHAPTER FOUR
DATA ANALYSIS, PRESENTATION AND INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
4.0 Introduction
This was a section where data was collected and analyzed and presented. The topic of
study was THE IMPACT OF TOURISM ON UGANDA'S ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT: A CASE
STUDY OF LAKE MBURO NATIONAL PARK IN WESTERN UGAND. The following statistical
findings are from data collected by the use of questionnaires and interview guides.
Data collection occurred from a total of 80 respondents whereby they filled
questionnaires. Presentation of findings was then done in line with the objectives of
the study whereby the raw data in the form of questionnaires was edited and
interpreted, which ensured uniformity, legibility, and consistency. Then, data-filled
questionnaires were copied and analyzed by tallying and tabling in frequency polygons
while identifying how often certain responses occurred and later an evaluation was
done. The information was then recorded in terms of percentages.
The direct economic benefits generated through tourism activities in Lake Mburo
National Park include revenue from park entry fees, accommodation, sales of food
and beverages, and other services related to tourism activities.
Statistics in table 4.5 below summarize the findings on this objective.
Responses where in form of ticking against statements in regards to the respondent's
degree of acceptance.

Table 4.5 presents insights into the direct economic benefits derived from tourism
activities at Lake Mburo National Park, focusing on various aspects such as park entry
fees, accommodation, food and beverage sales, and other related services.
Revenue from Park Entry Fees: The responses indicate that a significant portion of
respondents (25 or 31.25%) strongly agree that the park generates substantial revenue
from entry fees. Additionally, 20 respondents (25%) agree with this statement.
However, a combined total of 15 respondents (18.75%) expressed skepticism, with 5
(6.25%) unsure and 10 (12.5%) disagreeing. This suggests that while many recognize
the potential for revenue generation, there is a notable portion of the population that
doubts the overall effectiveness of entry fees in contributing to the park's financial
health.
Accommodation Providers: For accommodation providers, 20 respondents (25%)
strongly agree and 25 (31.25%) agree that these businesses earn significant income
from tourists. However, 15 respondents (18.75%) show uncertainty or disagreement,
with 5 (6.25%) unsure and 10 (12.5%) disagreeing. This indicates a positive view of the
accommodation sector's profitability but also highlights concerns regarding its
sustainability and capacity to attract tourists consistently.
Food and Beverage Establishments: The responses regarding food and beverage
establishments are particularly optimistic, with 30 respondents (37.5%) strongly
agreeing and another 30 (37.5%) agreeing that these businesses earn substantial
revenue from tourists. Notably, no respondents were uncertain about this aspect,
which suggests a strong consensus on the importance of dining options in the park's


economic landscape. However, 20 respondents (25%) expressed doubts or
disagreement about the overall revenue generated, indicating that while some
businesses thrive, others may not be as successful.
Other Tourism-Related Services: The responses for other tourism-related services
present a more mixed picture. Only 10 respondents (12.5%) strongly agree that these
services earn significant income, while 30 (37.5%) agree. A substantial number of
respondents (35 or 43.75%) expressed skepticism, with 25 (31.25%) disagreeing. This
indicates that while some services may be successful, there is considerable concern
regarding the overall financial viability of tourism-related businesses such as tour
operators and craft vendors.
Overall Economic Activity: Finally, regarding the overall economic activity generated
by tourism, 30 respondents (37.5%) strongly agree and another 30 (37.5%) agree that
it provides substantial direct benefits to the local and regional economy. This strong
positive sentiment reflects a belief in tourism's capacity to drive economic growth,
with only a small number of respondents (20 or 25%) expressing disagreement or
uncertainty. This suggests a general consensus on the positive impact of tourism on
economic development in the region.

Table 4.6 Economic Impact of Tourism at Lake Mburo National Park: This indicates the
respondents' perception regarding the contribution of tourism towards the economy of
Uganda. The survey consists of five key statements, each reflection of the different
dimensions of tourism's economic impact.
A sum of 25 respondents strongly agrees to the statement that tourism greatly
contributes to the GDP growth of Uganda, while 30 agree to the statement. This
means the Lake Mburo people have a strong belief in the economic importance of
tourism. However, 15 respondents are skeptical: 10 disagree, while 5 strongly
disagree. This means that while many recognize tourism's potential, there is concern
over its overall effectiveness in driving GDP growth.
Foreign Exchange Earnings: Regarding foreign exchange earnings, a total of 20
respondents strongly agreed that the earnings from international visitors have a
meaningful effect in terms of Uganda's total foreign exchange earnings, while 30
disagree, which means a highly skeptical feeling among the respondents. The
responses are divided, with 15 agreeing, 6 neutral, and 9 strongly disagreeing. This


indicates concern about the sustainability and impact of tourism on foreign exchange
earnings.
A total of 30 respondents strongly agreed that tourism supports Uganda's national
development goals, equating to 37.5%, while 40 or 50% agreed to this. This strong
agreement demonstrates consensus over tourism's role in creating jobs, reducing
poverty, and developing infrastructure. Only 10 respondents or 12.5% disagreed,
meaning that the majority view tourism as an integral part of national development.
Responding to the question of linkages to other sectors, 15 respondents strongly agree
and 35 agree. In return, there are 30 respondents disagreeing, with 25 strongly
disagreeing. This response reflects the concern over the integration of tourism into
other sectors of the economy; though some appreciate the potential, many feel the
linkages are weak or underdeveloped.
Last but not least, about the justification of investment by the government in the
park, 10 strongly agreed, 5 agreed, 40 disagreed, and 10 strongly disagreed. Thus, a
majority of the respondents seemed to develop a critical attitude toward the
investment strategy pursued by the government; this means that many did not
consider the benefit derived from the tourism sector to be sufficient to justify such an
investment at present times.
4.8 Policies and strategies put in place by the government of Uganda towards
maximizing the economic benefit from tourism at Lake Mburo National Park.

The survey includes five key statements, each reflecting different dimensions of
tourism's economic impact
A majority of respondents, 25 (31.25%), strongly agree that tourism significantly
contributes to Uganda's GDP growth, while 30 (37.5%) agree with this statement. This
indicates a strong belief in the economic importance of tourism at Lake Mburo.
However, 15 respondents (18.75%) are skeptical, with 10 (12.5%) disagreeing and 5
(6.25%) strongly disagreeing. This suggests that while many recognize tourism's
potential, there are concerns about its overall effectiveness in driving GDP growth.
Regarding foreign exchange earnings, 20 respondents (25%) strongly agree that the
earnings from international visitors are meaningful for Uganda's total foreign
exchange. However, 30 (37.5%) disagree, indicating a significant level of skepticism.
The responses show a divide, with 15 (18.75%) agreeing, 6 (7.5%) neutral, and 9
(11.25%) strongly disagreeing. This highlights a concern about the sustainability and
impact of tourism on foreign exchange earnings.
A substantial number of respondents (30 or 37.5%) strongly agree that tourism
supports Uganda's national development goals, with 40 (50%) agreeing. This strong
agreement indicates a consensus on the role of tourism in job creation, poverty
reduction, and infrastructure development. Only 10 respondents (12.5%) expressed
disagreement, suggesting that most see tourism as a vital component of national
development.


On the question of linkages to other sectors, 15 respondents (18.75%) strongly agree
and 35 (43.75%) agree. However, 30 respondents (37.5%) disagree, with 25 (31.25%)
expressing strong disagreement. This response reflects concerns about the integration
of tourism with other sectors of the economy, indicating that while some see
potential benefits, many feel the linkages are weak or underdeveloped.
Lastly, regarding the justification of government investment in the park, only 10
respondents (12.5%) strongly agree, while 5 (6.25%) agree. A significant portion, 40
(50%), disagree, and 10 (12.5%) strongly disagree. This highlights a critical view of the
government's investment strategy, suggesting that many respondents do not perceive
the tourism sector's benefits as sufficient to warrant current levels of investment.

The table presents respondents' perceptions regarding the economic contributions of
tourism at Lake Mburo National Park, focusing on various aspects such as revenue
generation, income for local businesses, and overall economic benefits. The responses
are categorized into five statements, with percentages reflecting the distribution of
opinions among the participants.


A significant portion of respondents, 25 (31.25%), strongly agree that the park
generates substantial revenue from entry fees, while 30 (37.5%) agree. However, 20
respondents (25%) disagree, and 5 (6.25%) strongly disagree. The lack of neutral
responses suggests a clear division of opinion, indicating that while many see entry
fees as an important revenue source, a substantial number of people are skeptical
about the overall financial impact.
For other tourism businesses, 20 respondents (25%) strongly agree that these entities
earn significant income from visitors, while 15 (18.75%) agree. However, the response
also includes 6 (7.5%) who are neutral, 3 (3.75%) who disagree, and 2 (2.5%) who
strongly disagree. This suggests a more positive view of the tourism sector's impact on
local businesses, although the presence of neutral and negative responses indicates
some uncertainty about the overall profitability of these businesses.
Regarding accommodation providers, 30 respondents (37.5%) strongly agree and 40
(50%) agree that these businesses earn substantial income from tourists. However, 60
respondents (75%) disagree that these establishments are significantly benefiting from
tourism, which highlights a significant concern regarding their viability. The data
suggests that while some believe accommodation providers benefit from tourism, a
large portion is skeptical about their profitability.
The responses indicate a lack of confidence in the economic benefits for local food
and beverage establishments. Only 7 respondents (8.75%) strongly agree that these
establishments benefit from tourist spending, while 3 (3.75%) agree. In contrast, a
notable 20 respondents (25%) disagree, and 6 (7.5%) strongly disagree. This indicates a


perception that food and beverage businesses may not be capturing the expected
revenue from tourism, raising concerns about their economic sustainability.
On the question of whether tourism at the park provides substantial economic
benefits to the local and national economy, only 10 respondents (12.5%) strongly
agree, while 5 (6.25%) agree. A significant number of respondents (15 or 18.75%)
disagree, and 10 (12.5%) strongly disagree. This reveals a critical view of tourism's
overall contribution, suggesting that many respondents do not perceive it as having a
meaningful impact on economic development.
