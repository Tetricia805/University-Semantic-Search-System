Abstract

Child sponsorship programs are initiatives run by various non-profit organizations and charities
to support and improve the lives of children in need. These programs aim to provide financial
assistance and essential resources to children living in poverty or difficult circumstances,
typically in developing countries. While the available literature might be limited to only the
benefits of Child sponsorship programs on host communities as a form of community
development, there is little literature on the role played by child sponsorship projects on the
welfare of beneficiaries. Specifically, no such study has been conducted on compassion
international in Bweyogerere. Consequently, this research sought to examine the impact of
compassion international child sponsorship on the welfare of beneficiaries sponsored under the
program. The specific objectives pursued were three: To investigate the impact of child
sponsorship on the beneficiaries’ access to formal education, to explore the impact of child
sponsorship on the protection of the beneficiary children’s rights in Bweyogerere and to
investigate the impact of child sponsorship on the social welfare of the beneficiaries in
Bweyogerere. A sample of 200 respondents was purposively selected from a population of 500
project beneficiaries, composed of project ongoing students and alumni. Structured
questionnaires, document review, beneficiary and key informant interviews and field-based
observation were used to collect data. Validity was ensured through expert reviews while
reliability analysis was carried out using Cronbach’s alpha coefficient. Quantitative data was
analyzed using both descriptive and inferential statistics while qualitative data was transcribed,
analyzed and reported. The study concluded that prior to the project many children within the
project area of operation did not have access to formal education, their rights were not protected
and their social welfare was poor. However, upon being enrolled into compassion international
child sponsorship program, the beneficiaries were able to get access to formal education, their
rights were protected and their social welfare improved. The study concluded that the
compassion international child sponsorship program played a critical role in the welfare of the
beneficiaries. The research therefore recommended that compassion international child
sponsorship program should improve more on their objectives in order to ensure more
effectiveness in accessing formal education, healthcare and food by enrolled beneficiaries.




CHAPTER ONE
INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background to the study
Child sponsorship can be defined as a fundraising in which a charitable organization associates a
donor sponsor with a particular child beneficiary (Wydick et al., 2017). According to (Watson,
2015), some of the features of child sponsorship include regular payments by sponsors and
exchange of personal information about specific children in the form of letters, cards, school
reports, or updates.

Child sponsorship, especially the type that links a sponsor directly to the child-beneficiary has
played a critical role in alleviating suffering and improving the living standards of beneficiaries.
The bond between the sponsor and the beneficiary makes sponsorship an unusually lengthy and
stable source of NGO income; and the sponsorship provides the sponsors with a window into the
lives of people in a developing country (Eekelen, 2013).

Child sponsorship programs have been in existence since the 1930s, and they have grown to the
extent that today 3.5 million children in developing countries are being sponsored through the
eight largest child sponsorship programs (see Table 1.1).

Not much of the reviewed literature has explored the impact of such projects on the individual
welfare of the beneficiaries involved at the village level in the context of Uganda. Hence my


study will focus on measuring the impacts of these sponsorships to the life of beneficiaries and to
add to the global empirical findings of the effects of the Compassion International child
sponsorship program. Previous studies of former sponsored Compassion International children
revealed positive and significant effects on their education, probability of employment and
occupational choice (Wydick, Glewwe, & Rutledge, 2011). Moreover, a follow up study in
Kenya on adult life outcomes disclosed that sponsored children, when compared with their nonsponsored siblings, scored higher on an adapted Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (Ross & Wydick,
2011). These empirical results seem to align with teachings found in Proverbs 22:6 “Train up a
child in the way he should go; even when he is old he will not depart from it” (New International
Version).

1.2 Statement of the Problem
There exists, across the globe, many projects that are aimed at enhancing child sponsorship.
These projects have invariably had tremendous impact on the lives of beneficiary communities
(Boon et al., 2013; Smith, 2008; World Bank, 2015). Never the less, not much of the reviewed
literature has explored the impact of such projects on the welfare of the beneficiaries involved at
the village level in the context of Uganda. Quite a number of studies about child sponsorship in
the USA, Europe and Asia exist such as Bruce et al.'s (2013) study on child sponsorship covering
Europe and Asia. However, such studies have not been done on child sponsorship in Uganda
especially in the urban context. In Bweyogerere, various challenges have adversely affected
children in terms of nutrition, health, formal education and their general welfare, which has
resulted into hopelessness for the affected children. Compassion International – Uganda is one of
the NGOs that have attempted to address these challenges in Bweyogerere. Nevertheless, in-spite
of this effort by Compassion international to the sponsored children, the impact of the
sponsorship to the beneficiaries is not known. Thus, this study sought to examine the impact of
child sponsorship on the welfare of the beneficiaries in Bweyogerere.
1.3 Purpose of the study
The main objective of this study was to examine the impact of child sponsorship programs on the
welfare of children sponsored in Bweyogerere.


1.4 Research Objectives
Based on the aforementioned main objective, this research will be guided by the following
specific objectives:
i) To investigate the impact of child sponsorship on the beneficiaries’ access to formal
education
ii) To explore the impact of child sponsorship on the protection of the beneficiary children’s
rights in Bweyogerere
iii) To investigate the impact of child sponsorship on the social welfare of the beneficiaries in
Bweyogerere

1.5 Research Questions
i)
What is the impact of child sponsorship in helping beneficiaries in Bweyogerere
access formal education?
ii) What is the impact of child sponsorship in facilitating protection of beneficiary
children’s rights in Bweyogerere?
iii) What is the impact of child sponsorship on the social welfare of beneficiaries in
Bweyogerere?

1.6 Significance of the Study
This study will be significant to Compassion International Uganda for it is crucial for evidencebased policy-making, program improvement, and ensuring the well-being and development of
sponsored children and their communities. It helps to create more effective, equitable, and
sustainable interventions to support more vulnerable children.

This study will as well be significant for it will document the contribution of child sponsorship
programs to the beneficiaries’ overall welfare on formal education, children’s rights protection,
social welfare and psychological welfare. As such, it will enable the sponsoring agencies to focus
on the areas that need more attention in future.

This study will also be vital to the Government of Uganda and the local authorities of
Bweyogerere when it comes to planning. This will in turn guide policy formulation, especially
about areas of intervention for NGOs which are operating within the country.


1.7 Justification of the Study
This study was conducted on the compassion international child sponsorship program in
Bweyogerere, Wakiso district. This was because the program deals with children from poor
families in the area and no study has been done on the compassion international child
sponsorship program to evaluate its impact on individual beneficiary’s welfare and in an urban
setup area like Bweyogerere.

1.8 Limitations of the Study
Some of the respondents were not willing to give information to the researcher and it was hard to
convince them that the information gathered was specifically for research purposes only and that
it wouldn’t be exposed to any other party
The other limitation to the research was time as there was little time provided to carry out all
document’s reviews, beneficiary interviews and questionnaires and data analysis.
The sponsorship study flagged the risk of respondents’ bias in the survey responses, in that
children or adults responding on their behalf could offer answers that they think Plan
International would wish to hear. The research team uncovered a large bias in the supplementary
questionnaire arising from adults replying on children’s behalf about their wellbeing. However,
for the analysis, the research team chose to rely only on a subset of data where children replied
to.
Some questionnaires given to beneficiaries were not correctly filled and hence they couldn’t be
considered among the sample.
1.9 Basic Assumptions of the study
The assumptions adopted by this study was that the beneficiaries and alumni selected as the
sample size were to provide accurate and enough information to aid in drawing conclusions and
findings of the study. The other assumption was that the beneficiaries were corporative and will
be willing to share the required information.




CHAPTER TWO
LITERATURE REVIEW
2.1 Introduction
This section will review theoretical and empirical literature. The literature will focus on child
sponsorship projects and their role on the individual project beneficiaries. The review will be
done as per the objectives of the study.

2.1
Empirical literature
2.1.1 Child sponsorship
Child sponsorship involves monthly remittance sent from sponsors, through NGO’s such as
compassion international, World Vision, and Save the Children to children sponsored in Uganda.
According to Eekelen (2013), child sponsorship model has grown ever since an American
journalist witnessed the plight of Korean orphans, established World Vision, and introduced a
sponsorship program in1953.

Various studies have been carried out on child sponsorship programs and access to various
services to improve access to Formal Education. Studies by (Eekelen, 2013) have made a
comparison of sponsorship programs of 30 non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in the UK,
USA, Belgium, Germany and France in the one-to-one child sponsorship programs, but failed to
evaluate their impact on access to healthcare, nutrition and formal education of the beneficiaries

2.1.2 Child sponsorship models
There are three basic models, although some organizations combine two or more of the basic
sponsorship models to carry out their mission.
i) Community Projects Model - Some child sponsorship organizations pool the funds from
individual sponsors to help support larger community projects like the development of
new schools or hospitals. These organizations also might distribute general goods like
food or clothing to entire communities.
ii) Direct Support Model - Organizations such as Compassion International connect
individual sponsors with children in need, providing them and their families with
resources such as food, education, health-care, vocational training and micro-loans.


iii) Third-Party Support Model - A few organizations use the sponsorship dollars they collect
to support local groups or organizations that already provide resources for people living
in poverty, including schools, churches, shelters and food banks (Marketwire,2011)

2.1.3 The compassion international child sponsorship model
Compassion International is a child sponsorship program that has been providing support and
assistance to children in need since 1952.
Wydick, Glewwe and Rutledge (2013) have studied child sponsorship through Compassion
International in six countries in Europe and Asia and found it to have had a big (positive) impact
on adult life outcomes - Such studies have also been done in some African countries. In Uganda,
Compassion International - Uganda (CI - U) has been running child sponsorship projects across
many Districts, yet there are no studies that have been conducted to ascertain the impact of such
projects on the welfare of the beneficiaries.

Here's an overview of the Compassion International child sponsorship program model:
1. Child Selection: Compassion International partners with local churches in developing
countries to identify children in need of support. These children often come from vulnerable
backgrounds, facing challenges such as poverty, and lack of access to education, healthcare, and
proper nutrition.
2. Individual Child Sponsorship: The heart of the Compassion International program lies in
individual child sponsorship. Donors from around the world can choose to sponsor a specific
child by making monthly contributions. Sponsors are encouraged to develop a personal
relationship with their sponsored child through letters and updates, offering encouragement and
support.
3. Holistic Development: The sponsorship program aims to address the holistic needs of the
child. Each sponsored child gains access to education, medical care, nutritious meals, and lifeskills training. The focus is on empowering children to break free from the cycle of poverty and
become responsible, self-sufficient adults.
4. Local Church Involvement: Compassion International partners with local churches, believing
that they are best positioned to understand and respond to the specific needs of their
communities. The sponsored children usually participate in development programs organized by
these churches, which fosters a sense of community and belonging.


5. Regular Updates: Sponsors receive regular updates on the progress and well-being of their
sponsored child. Compassion International facilitates communication between sponsors and
children through letters, photos, and even the possibility of in-person visits if the sponsor
chooses to visit the child's country.
7. Graduation Program: Compassion International's goal is to see the sponsored children grow
into self-sustaining, responsible adults. Once a sponsored child reaches a certain age and
completes their education, they are eligible to participate in the "Graduation Program." This
program helps young adults transition into independence by providing additional support and
guidance.
These and other studies also did not empirically establish the association between child
sponsorship and beneficiary welfare. It is with this concern that the research seeks to examine the
impact of child sponsorship programs on the welfare of beneficiaries

2.2 The Impact of Child Sponsorship in Facilitating Access to Formal Education
Bruce et al. (2013) studied child sponsorship by Compassion International in six countries in
Europe and Asia and found the sponsorship to have had a positive impact on adult life outcomes.
Thus, there is evidence that child sponsorship projects actually improve beneficiaries' access to
education.

A study by Eekelen (2013) has made a comparison of sponsorship programs of thirty nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in the UK, USA, Belgium, Germany, and France in the oneto-one child sponsorship programs. One-to-one child sponsorship programs are defined as
programs in which individual sponsors make periodic payments that organizations transfer to the
foster parents of particularly disadvantaged children.
The initial model provided direct support to children in orphanages. The model was replicated
and modified, and over time, these sponsorship programs grew in number, size and diversity
across the world according to (UNESCO, 2015).
The study by Kremer et al (2003), who used a randomized experiment to analyze the impacts of
a Dutch child sponsorship program that funded new classroom construction and provided
students a $6 uniform and $3.44 worth of textbooks. They found that even these relatively lowcost interventions induced student beneficiaries to attend school a half year longer and to
advance a third of a grade further in formal education.



Various studies have been carried out on child sponsorship programs and access to various
services to improve access to Formal Education. Studies by (Eekelen, 2013) have made a
comparison of sponsorship programs of 30 non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in the UK,
USA, Belgium, Germany and France but failed to evaluate their impact on protection of
beneficiary children’s rights and other studies also did not empirically establish the association
between program sponsorship and access to formal education. It was with this concern that the
current study sought to examine the impact of sponsorship program on access to formal
education by the CI-CSP beneficiaries.
2.3 The impact of child sponsorship on the social welfare of the beneficiaries
(Van Ijzendoorn et al., 2011) propose that children exposed to institutional care can suffer from
what they call ‘structural neglect’ which combines environmental challenges such as minimum
physical resources, challenging staffing patterns and inadequacy in caregiver-child interactions
all of which can impact child development.

The studies above did not empirically establish the association between program sponsorship and
social welfare. It was with this concern that the current study sought to evaluate the effect of
sponsorship program on social welfare of the beneficiaries of Bweyogerere.
2.4 The impact of child sponsorship on the protection of the beneficiary children’s
rights
A group of large-scale studies identified children to be exposed to physical maltreatment by
caregivers (Attar-Schwartz et al., 2013), both physical and verbal victimization by peers (Attar-
Schwartz & Khoury-Kassabri, 2015) as well as sexual victimization by peers (Attar-Schwartz,
(2014). Younger children and particularly children with greater levels of adjustment difficulties
were found to be particularly vulnerable within these settings (Attar-Schwartz et al., 2015).
2.5 Theoretical literature
The research will be guided by the theory of change and its components that is; Inputs, activities,
Outputs, Outcomes and impact
According to Dale and Sorensen (1975), theory of change (ToC) was formulated by Lewin
(1947) as a framework to investigate conditions in the successful application of management
science. Since then, it has been widely used in management to implement change.


On critical analysis (Anheier et al, 2005) sees the theory of change as an approach that represents
beliefs about what is needed by the target population and what strategies will enable them to
meet those needs. In essence, to establishes a context for considering the connection between a
system’s mission, strategies and actual outcomes, while creating links between who is being
served, the strategies or activities that are being implemented, and the desired outcomes.

In my research I intent to base on the three components of the theory that is input (the children
selected for sponsorship), Activities (programs and resources introduced to these children) and
outcome/impact (impact of these programs and resources to the welfare of the beneficiary).
In a nutshell, the theory of change is a useful tool for the management of projects or programs
since projects or programs endeavor to cause positive change in peoples' lives. The theory gives
a technique of progressing from project problem, through strategies and resources to be applied,
to eventual outcomes. The theory of change will help me to evaluate how the child sponsorship
programs impact the beneficiaries’ lives in my study area.


2.6 The Conceptual framework
According to Anheier et al. (2005), Theory of Change has two broad components. The first one
is the conceptualizing and operationalizing the three core frames of the theory which define the
populations (who you are serving), the strategies (what strategies you believe will accomplish
desired outcomes) and the outcomes (what you intend to accomplish). In this case in relation to
our conceptual framework the three core frames are: beneficiaries (population), providing access
to formal education, food and healthcare (strategies) and finally improved wellbeing of the
beneficiaries (outcome). The second component of the theory of change involves building an
understanding of the relationships among the three core elements and expressing those
relationships clearly. This is because the theory of change is defined by the three core elements
and the relationship that exists between them just as shown in figure 1 where the relationship
between the Project and the Welfare of the Beneficiaries is illustrated by the conceptual
framework.





In my research the independent variable was the child sponsorship which recruits the
beneficiaries into the program and does the administration and management of the sponsorship
program. The research project objectives interrogated the impact of the program to the
beneficiaries and these impacts are the dependent variables
The intervening variables (government policy and culture) are factors which may impact the
sponsored child as well but, in this case, they were not part of the study

Figure 2.1: Conceptual Framework



2.8 Research Gaps
The reviewed literature shows that studies have been conducted on the subject of child
sponsorship. However, little research had been conducted on the impact of these child
sponsorship programs on individual beneficiary welfare more especially how impactful is the
program to the protection of the beneficiary’s welfare and the impact of the programe on the
social welfare of the beneficiary, making it difficult to assess the net worth of the interventions
on the beneficiaries. Locally, the outcome of compassion international CSP in Bweyogerere has
not been studied and thus, it is difficult to know the worth of this project to the beneficiaries in
the area.


CHAPTER THREE
METHODOLOGY
3.1 Introduction
In this chapter the research design, study area, study population, sample size, sampling
techniques, data collection methods, tools, analysis methods, instrument validation and reliability
test, and the ethical considerations considered are all described.
3.2 Research Design
The research applied case study approach, descriptive survey and correlation research designs.
A case study is an in-depth examination of a single phenomenon such as a person, a family, an
institution, an event, a process or a project (Yin, 2009). This design was appropriate for it helped
to yield in-depth data about the impact of the compassion international CSP on the beneficiaries.
Descriptive survey research was adopted as well. Orodho, (2003) states that descriptive survey is
a method of collecting information by interviews or administering a questionnaire to a sample of
individuals to determine research statistics of a problem and justify current situation or condition.
Correlation design was used in measuring the association between the study variables; that’s to
study whether an increase or decrease in the sponsorship would have an effect on the variables.
3.3 Target population
A study population is the total number of subjects over which study findings can be generalized
(Kothari, 2005). In this study, the population consisted of 300 program beneficiaries comprising
of 244 on-going beneficiaries, and 56 program alumni who have so far benefited from the
program. The 244 on-going students are those enrolled in various primary and secondary schools
as well as tertiary institutions and universities.

3.4 Sample size and Sampling Procedure
From the above population of the study that entailed 300 project beneficiaries, a sample of 200
was therefore drawn from the population of the study. The result for sampling frame is presented
in Table 3.2.

Secondary School Beneficiaries 100 74 74.0
University Beneficiaries 84 36 42.86
Total 300 200 66.67
Source: Field data

From Table 3.2 as shown above, a total sample size of 200 respondents was achieved, which was
66.67% of the total number of beneficiaries. According to Mugenda (1999), a sample size of
30% of the total population is considered sufficient for a research and hence this research
adopted 200(66.7% 0f 300) as the sample size
3.4.1 Sampling Procedure
From Table 3.1, a total sample size of 337 respondents was achieved, which was 82.9% of the
total number of beneficiaries. Each category of the respondents was scientifically sampled using
Krejcie and Morgan (1970) revised formula as shown in Appendix VII.
3.5 Data Collection Instruments
This study applied both primary and secondary data and the following were the data collection
instruments; structured questionnaires, document review, key informant interviews, and fieldbased observation.
i. Structured Questionnaires
A questionnaire is a written instruction(s) addressed to a study participant/respondent in
search of information. It consists of items that a respondent should react to in writing. A
questionnaire gathers information from a large group within a short period of time. The
questionnaire used in this study comprised of questions that targeted the project


beneficiaries (ongoing and alumni) to get their views concerning the dependant
variables; access to formal education, child rights protection and social welfare (see
appendix 1). The five-point type Likert scale was used to help the respondents to easily
choose an option that supported their opinion from the statements or questions that they
were to respond to. The scale measured their attitude by measuring the extent to which
they agreed or disagreed with these statements or questions. The findings were then
analyzed using descriptive statistics mainly Mean and Standard Deviations.
ii. Document review
This method was used to gather information from documents at the compassion
international- CSP centre including the project admission records, student medical
records and student class progress records. These documents provided the relevant data
about the beneficiaries regarding the role of the project on their welfare. The document
review checklist was the tool that was used in this data collection method.
iii. Interviews
An interview is a form of communication verbally where one person or group of
persons ask the other group questions to gather information or opinions about an issue.
Key-informant interviews were conducted on the beneficiaries and other stakeholders
who include caregivers, project staff, church leaders, local leaders and teachers. The
purpose of using interviews was to collect detailed information which would otherwise
not be possible to collect using other methods. The data that was collected focused on
the background history of beneficiaries before being enrolled into the program, how
they got enrolled in the Program, their experiences and challenges while in the program,
among other questions
iv. Observation
An observation is a data collection method by which one gathers knowledge of the
researched phenomenon through making observations of the phenomena as and when it
occurs. This method was used to triangulate the data obtained through the other methods
namely document review, questionnaires and interviews. In other words, it was used to
confirm the information collected via these methods since it involves physically
verifying information already collected. The tool that was used alongside the


observation method was the observation schedule. Using this observation schedule, the
researcher listed issues which were then marked as having been observed or not
observed in the field.
3.5.1 Validity of the Instruments
Validity passé is the degree to which results obtained from the analysis of the data actually
represent the phenomenon under study. Validity explains how well the collected data covers the
actual area of investigation (Ghauri and Gronhaug, 2005). Content validity was ensured by
constructing the tools for the study to cover all the aspects on compassion international Child
Sponsorship Program that adequately address the research objectives and giving them to expert
reviewers to ascertain this. This way, the researcher ensured that the tools measured what they
were intended to measure.
3.5.2 Reliability of instruments
Reliability is a measure of the degree to which a research instrument yields consistent results or
data after repeated trials Mugenda and Mugenda (2003). Reliability in research is influenced by
random error, as random errors increase, reliability decreases. Errors may arise from inaccurate
coding and ambiguous instructions to the respondents. The researcher subjected the
questionnaire and interview guide to expert opinion to ensure that they are capable of yielding
consistent data every time they are applied. Pilot-testing was then done by subjecting the
questionnaire and interview guide to the beneficiaries of compassion international CSP in other
districts, a similar project to compassion international CSP in Bweyogerere to assess the
applicability and acceptability of the research tools.
3.6 Data collection Procedure
The researcher wrote letters to local authorities and seeking authorization to carry out interviews
in the area which were granted and then he got research assistants to help him in the interviews
and questionaries. There was a pre-visit to compassion international offices in Bweyogerere
seeking permission and access for data review and interviewing the students on the ongoing
program, questionaries were drafted and distributed to the sample population and physical and
virtual meetings were arranged with the program alumni because some of them had busy work
schedules. The researcher also with the help of research assistants carried out observations of
some data as necessitated by the research.


3.7
Data processing and analysis
For quantitative data, SPSS package was used. The data was collected and analyzed as per the
objectives of the study. Frequency counts, percentages, means and standard deviations were
sought as descriptive statistics. Pearson product moment correlation was used to establish the
associations among the variables of interest. For qualitative data, the initial steps of data analysis
involved data crosschecking for accuracy and completeness then thematic analysis method was
used to analyze it. Thematic analysis helped in identifying themes and patterns emerging from
the qualitative data that were important as collected from interviews. The emergent themes were
then used to arrive at various conclusions about the study objectives.
3.8
Ethical Considerations
Before this study, the researcher sought permission from all concerned authorities and also
maintained confidentiality at all times and did not reveal the identity of other subjects used in the
study or their information to parties not related to the study. In this case, names of the
respondents were not referred to; instead, they were given identification numbers for
confidentiality reasons. Respondents participated voluntarily and their informed consent was
sought before involving them in the study. Another aspect of ethics that was considered was the
privacy of the respondents. Information that is considered confidential was processed carefully
including non-disclosure of individual comments and opinions.


CHAPTER FOUR
DATA ANALYSIS, INTERPRETATION AND PRESENTATIONS

4.1 Introduction
This chapter presents the analysis and findings with regard to the objectives of the research and a
case study of compassion international Bweyogerere and an in-depth discussion of these results.
Descriptive statistics specifically means standard deviations together with correlation were used
as statistical tools for quantitative data. For qualitative data, themes were derived from
interviewees’ responses, analyzed and presented as quotes. The respondents were mainly the
program beneficiaries which included all male and female. The findings are presented in tables
as detailed subsequently starting with response return rate, demographic characteristics of
respondents, and finally findings as per the objectives of the study.
4.2 Response Rate
Out of the 200 questionnaires given out to various program beneficiaries and alumni by the
researcher and his team, none was returned unfilled and data was recovered from all the 200 just
that unfortunately 20 did not adequately fill the questionnaires and this kind of questionnaires
were not considered.
4.3 Demographics
The respondents’ demographic characteristics included: gender, age and educational level. And
are discussed below with help of tables.
4.3.1 Gender of respondents

that were looked at included: criteria for recruiting beneficiaries to the project, beneficiaries’
provision of school materials, payment of school fees and school absenteeism. In order to
achieve the objective, respondents gave their feedback on a five-point Likert scale on attributes
of formal education. The scale was reverse coded so that Strongly Disagree (SD) represented a
score of 1, Disagree (D)-2, Neutral (N)-3, Agree (A)-4 and Strongly Agree (SA) a score of 5 see
appendix I section II.
Table 4.5: Facilitating access to formal education

The findings in table 4.5 above show various indicators of access to formal education as revealed
by the respondents and from the findings , 46(25.56%) strongly agree and 77(42.78%) agree that
the compassion international scholarship program pays fees for beneficiaries and 37(20.56%)
Strongly agree and 68(37.78%) agree that when admitted to the program the beneficiaries
absenteeism reduces all which portray a positive impact of the sponsorship program on the
beneficiaries’ access to formal education
Findings from the qualitative analysis were also presented. Various findings were made with
regard to the impact of child sponsorship in facilitating access to formal education by
beneficiaries of compassion international Bweyogerere child sponsorship Project. The main
objective that drives the formal education component of the project is to provide funding for fees

and other school levies to enable children from poor families access formal education. The
project also aims at imparting spiritual and moral knowledge as well as life skills that should
help in molding an all-round person. Findings from the interviews with respondents however
revealed some challenges of access to formal education by beneficiaries prior to joining the
project, the interventions that are being undertaken to address the challenges, and the role of
compassion international Bweyogerere CSP in facilitating access to formal education by
beneficiaries as detailed hereafter.
The study found out that the beneficiaries of compassion international Bweyogerere CSP came
from family backgrounds where it was difficult to get the basic necessities of life and the
aforementioned challenges compounded the problem and made it difficult for most of the
children from poor families to access formal education.
4.5 Thematic analysis in respect of access to formal education
In this section, the data the researcher collected from respondents was sieved into themes which
were analyzed and presented below in form of quotes. The presentations provide respondents
background information on their worst situation before joining the sponsorship program and the
positive changes they realized after being enrolled in the project.
i. Fees payment
Children in this project reported that due to their poor home background, it was difficult for their
school fees to be paid because their parents didn’t have employment, had no crops or animals to
sell to get money for their fees. This made it hard for them to be kept in school to pursue formal
education. The quotes below explain it all.
The project has been the biggest motivation platform in my education life. My fees is
paid termly and within the stipulated time frame. This has made me enjoy life in
boarding school. Their reward system for the children who perform better has really
improved my performance because I have been yearning for the best so as to be
recognized and be rewarded handsomely (Interviewee 2).

My achievement so far has been motivated by being regular in school due to timely
fee payment by the compassion international CSP. The project has provided enough
books and writing materials which I utilize maximumly Today, I am a first-year
student at UCU University pursuing Bachelor of Education (English & Literature). I


have always been appreciative to the project for transforming my life. This would not
have been possible if the chance to join the project had not come my way.
(Interviewee 8)


ii. Writing materials
Prior to joining the project, children did not have the required materials such as text books,
exercise books and pens to use in school hence learning was difficult. It was found that most
children could go to school without writing materials. The quotes below support this analysis.
The project supplies beneficiaries with both text books and exercise books, pens and
other writing materials to be used while in school to make learning comfortable.
These materials enhance beneficiaries’ school attendance. (Project Director)

Am happy am now settled in school from the time the project started supporting me
with school requirements like books, pens and Mathematical sets that have enabled
me remain in school up to where I am now. (Interviewee 3)
iii. School absenteeism
Most children reported they could not attend school regularly because of being sent home due to
non-payment of school dues. The area had not been receiving any form of help in terms of
bursaries from the government which resulted in many children being absent from school most
of the time. This is proved by the narrative below:-

I commend the project for sponsoring the respondents’ access education which has
improved the list of university graduates from Ivola sub-location to eight. Due to
poverty and bias in the distribution of constituency bursaries the area did not benefit
much hence the low number of University graduates from the area. (Area Chief)

Other than the formal education component, students participate in age graded games/sports and
activities which include rope skipping, marbles, football, darts, volleyball, mentorship, health
screening, discipleship programs, motivational speaking, children rights, HIV/AIDS education
and life skills. These were found to be complementing academic achievement by enabling the
learners to be mentally, spiritually, emotionally and physically fit to take their studies.


In conclusion, the above themes from respondents demonstrate the fact that before these
beneficiaries joined the Ivola project it was difficult for them to access formal education. When
they were enrolled in the project, they are supported and now the situation has improved for the
better and now they are able to access formal education with ease.
4.6 The impact of child sponsorship on the social welfare of the beneficiaries
The respondents were asked about how compassion international child sponsorship program has
impacted their social well-being and, in our interviews, and questionnaires, The attributes that
were looked at included: Beneficiary’s access to food, Beneficiary’s access to medical care,
employment after the program, housing among others. In order to achieve the objective,
respondents gave their feedback on a five-point Likert scale on attributes of social welfare. There
was a range of one to five which were; Strongly Disagree (SD) representing a score of 1,
Disagree (D)-2, Neutral (N)-3, Agree (A)-4 and Strongly Agree (SA) a score of 5 the results are
shown in Table 4.6.

4.7 Thematic analysis with respect to social welfare
This section presents quotes from interviewed respondents which were arrived at after analyzing
raw data into themes. The beneficiaries’ responses were checked to derive relevant themes for
analysis by the researcher. The analysis provides information on healthcare situation of the
beneficiaries before enrolling into the project and after being enrolled. The details of the
narrations show how the beneficiaries had difficulties in accessing food before joining the
project and how life changed for the better when they were enrolled in the project and started
accessing food through the effort of the project. The beneficiaries further demonstrate in their
quoted responses how the project has helped them become better citizens after finishing
education and get formal jobs that helped them change their lives and their community at large
sensitization.

Medical treatment
Prior to the project, whenever the children in this area were attacked by various diseases or
whenever they got sick, it was not easy for them because their parents could not afford to take
them to hospitals for treatment. So, most of them relied on concoctions or bought pain relieving
tablets. This kind of approach did not address their healthcare needs and therefore they suffered
from ill-health most of the time. This analysis is supported by the quote below:-

The project became a savior in my life upon admission into the sponsorship. Whenever
I fell sick I was taken for treatment in good hospitals and bills were paid by the project
as opposed to what the situation was before i was recruited, to this I appreciate Ivola
CSP so much (Interviewee 7).
The project conducted health screening sessions and my mother and I were discovered
to be HIV+. Since then, the project urgently intervened by providing counseling
sessions to us to accept the situation and live positively. The project staff referred us to
selected hospitals where great care clinics are found. I was immediately started on drugs
and the project does follow up of my progress. All my medical bills are paid for and I
live with no worry because I am medically insured. (Interviewee 5)



The project has helped the respondent and the mother to survive because before that,
they were always attacked by opportunistic diseases. Worst of all, the mother had no
income to facilitate their treatment. (Area Chief)
The conclusion drawn from the above presentations by respondents and analysis on access to
healthcare is that the Ivola Child Sponsorship has played a major role in facilitating
beneficiaries’ access to better healthcare through the various interventions they provided to them.
It is so concluded because the testimonies the beneficiaries gave on how poor their medical care
was before joining the project and what the situation is at the moment, there is no doubt the
project has improved their healthcare greatly.
Access to food
The children in the area were malnourished and starved because their parents do not grow food
on their small pieces of land which could support their families. Most parents are causal workers
and they could not afford a balanced diet. In some cases, some families were so large to the
extend feeding them adequately was a problem. The children reported they had one meal, two or
none per day.
Before the children were admitted in the project, they looked malnourished and were
also easily attacked by common ailments like stomach worms, ringworms, and
constant diarrhea. This was an indication that the immune system of the children was
weak due to lack of good diet. (Caregiver 2)
Employment after the program
I find myself more privileged to have the luck of benefiting from this project. Today,
I am an Accountant courtesy of prompt fees payment by compassion international
child Sponsorship program. (Interviewee 12)
The project has managed to enable many of our beneficiaries to acquire formal
education and transform their lives. Today many have their own careers by which
they make a living. Some of them are teachers, Information Technology experts,
accountants, social workers, farmers, hoteliers, economists among others. (Project
Teacher)


4.8 The impact of child sponsorship in facilitating protection of beneficiary children’s
rights
Respondents were finally asked to state to what extent the enrollment into compassion
international child sponsorship program in Bweyogerere has facilitated in the protection of
beneficiaries’ rights.
The responses are recorded on Table 4.7.

The findings in table 4.7 above show various indicators of how compassion international CSP ids
in protection of the beneficiary children’s rights access as revealed by the respondents and from
the findings , 67(37.22%) strongly disagree and 53(29.44%) disagree that a beneficiary of the
child sponsorship program can be exploited in form of child labor and 54(30.00%) Strongly
disagree and 49(27.22%) disagree that the beneficiaries oof compassion international CSP in
Bweyogerere are being discriminated in the society. Due to the limited time, only results with the
greater percentage were considered to reach a verdict for the research objective.

CHAPTER FIVE
SUMMARY OF FINDINGS, DISCUSSION, CONCLUSION AND
RECOMMENDATIONS
5.1 Overview
This chapter addresses the summary, conclusions and recommendations concerning the study
findings. Suggestions for further study have also been made.
5.2 Summary of Study Findings
This study sought to achieve three main objectives as follows: to examine the impact of the
compassion international Child Sponsorship Program in Bweyogerere on beneficiaries’ access to
formal education; to evaluate the impact of the program on beneficiaries’ social welfare and to
assess the impact of the program in protection of beneficiary children’s rights in Bweyogerere.
On demographic information, the study found out that the females dominated the ranks (106
female respondents) and (94 male). The highest number of respondents were in the age bracket
of (12-18) years. Followed by 19-25 years, then 26-32 years, then 33-39 years and finally 40
years and above. Education wise, most of the respondents were still students in primary and
secondary level and few had attained university degrees and some had dropped out.
The study established that all the beneficiaries' families were in a financial crisis before being
enrolled for sponsorship. This was revealed by the beneficiaries from their testimonies. Due to
the poverty-stricken conditions of the beneficiaries before admission into the project, their access
to formal education was severely hindered. According to the respondents, this was due to
frequent absenteeism from school because of non-payment of fees, school levies and lack of
other school requirements, for some of the respondents, there was no opportunity to join school
at all.

However, after joining the project, the study found out that there came benefits to the
respondents and their families in terms of provision of school fees and other requirements that
were contingent to access to formal education by the project beneficiaries; a situation that kept
them in school throughout.


The study established that before joining the project, the beneficiaries were malnourished and did
not have the means to access quality health-care, their future was bound to casual job and they
were destined to a chain of poverty. However, after joining the project, various health-care
services were at the disposal of the beneficiaries. The children were taken to hospital whenever
they fell ill, the beneficiaries got access to food whenever at the compassion center and those
who managed to complete education got formal jobs that helped them change their lives and
their communities
The intervention of Compassion International in Bweyogerere demonstrates its determination to
improve welfare of children in developing countries; especially by helping them have access to
good education (formal), healthcare and food. As (Byrant and White, 1992) recommend,
development in the Third World Countries will be achieved only when strong organizations
intervene in a positive and decisive way with the objective of creating change.
The study also established that before the enrollment of beneficiaries into compassion
international child sponsorship program in Bweyogerere their children’s rights were unchecked
and most of them were violated however the course of things changed after enrollment into the
sponsorship program to the best of the beneficiaries
5.3 Conclusion
On the basis of the afore-stated findings, this study concluded that compassion international CSP
has improved access to formal education by most of the beneficiaries in Bweyogerere. the
project had made a lasting impact in the lives of the beneficiaries as revealed by their own
accounts. However, the project should not just ignore the beneficiaries who drop-out. A
mechanism ought to be in place to follow up on those cases with a view of helping them
complete their studies.
The study also concluded that the project plays a major role in improving beneficiaries’ social
welfare. This is done by availing medical treatment, medical check-up services to the
beneficiaries, as well as food and a balanced diet and enabling beneficiaries complete their
education and get good casual jobs that help them transform their communities
The study finally concluded that the enrollment in compassion has helped in the protection of
beneficiary children’s rights as presented in the findings


5.4 Recommendations
Based on the study conclusions, several recommendations have been made. They included
among others include;
Based on the success that has been registered by the compassion international CSP in
Bweyogerere, the Government of Uganda should formulate a policy that gives incentives to nongovernmental organizations to design projects that improve the living standards of beneficiaries
within their target communities. Such policies should include the government giving NGOs free
land to encourage them start many such projects in all parts of the country. This will help to
alleviate suffering for most of families which are in similar circumstances and have no one to
help, hence easy to meet their objectives.
Compassion International should come up with a policy of making a follow up on the
beneficiaries who dropped out of project in order to understand why that happened and take
remedial measures. The measures should include ways of solving the challenges that the
beneficiaries go through both at home, in school and whenever at the project centre in order to
eliminate project drop out cases. The project should also drop the requirement that the
beneficiaries must be of Christian faith only because it is discriminatory.
5.5 Suggestion for Further Study
This study was carried out on one project that is run by CI-Kenya, yet it runs many other similar
projects in Kenya. There is need to undertake studies on such other projects in order to establish
their impact on the beneficiaries that they serve. This way, the full impact of such interventions
can be understood. The project should also find a way of eliminating reasons that make some of
the children to drop out of the project. This will enhance retention of the children in the project.
Lastly, this was primarily an explorative study. There is need for a more quantitative study
design to help isolate and measure more precisely some of the attributes and variables identified
here so that firmer recommendations can be made to improve project success, not just on Ivola
but also in other Compassion International projects elsewhere.
