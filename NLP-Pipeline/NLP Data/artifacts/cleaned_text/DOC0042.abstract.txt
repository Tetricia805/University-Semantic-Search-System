The controversy over the ordination of women as priests in the Church of the Province of Uganda has been
going on for a long time. Today, there are a few women priests in a good number of dioceses in the Church
of the Province of Uganda. But this revolution against the conservative order of male domination has not
come without a price. Women who feel called by God to the ministry in the Church of the Province of
Uganda are usually discriminated against even when they eventually become ordained. One wonders
whether women are called by God but ordained by men. This article looks at the work and ministry of one
of those women who opened the door to the ordination of women in the Church of the Province of Uganda.
In her response to the challenges of the time, Njangali not only refused the old definitions of women’s
involvement in church ministry but also guided the whole church to rethink and renew its leadership policy.
