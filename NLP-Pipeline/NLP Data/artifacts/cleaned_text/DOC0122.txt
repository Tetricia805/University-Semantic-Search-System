ABSTRACT
This dissertation aimed to explore the effect of e- procurement systems on organizational
performance within small and medium enterprises, dealing in different business in Uganda. The
study sought to achieve three specific objectives: to examine the effect of adoption of e
procurement systems on organizational performance, to examine the effect of data security on
organizational performance and to investigate the supplier readiness on e-procurement systems on
organizational performance. To achieve these objectives, a mixed-methods research approach was
adopted. Data was collected through a pre-tested close ended questionnaires and interviews with
staff at multiple small and medium enterprises and different departments like logistics,
procurement, ICT, and others.
The study revealed a strong positive correlation between the adoption of e-procurement systems
on organizational performance, with a significant relationship between the two. The research
results suggested that the consistent use of digital procurement tools like e-auctioning, e-tendering,
data security and effective management practices is very crucial for enhancing the performance of
Small and medium enterprises in Nakawa Division.
Data was collected using self-administered questionnaires. This study employed both stratified
sampling and simple random sampling techniques to select the sample size of 100 respondents that
were involved in the study. The findings of this study revealed that embracement of electronic
procurement contributes to the organization in different ways and that E-procurement systems
contributes organizational performance inform of increasing Profit margins, enhancing operational
efficiency, data security and promoting supplier relationships, The study also recommends that
SMES should continue utilizing e-procurement systems to enhance operational efficiency, supplier
relationship management, and overall organizational performance especially with in its
procurement processes. Small and medium enterprises should also invest in advanced e-tendering
software that offers greater customization and analytics capabilities in order to allow better
monitoring of procurement activities.





CHAPTER ONE
1.0 Introduction
In today's interconnected global economy, efficient and effective procurement processes are
essential for businesses to remain competitive. Traditional manual procurement methods are
increasingly inadequate to meet the demands of modern organizations, which require greater
efficiency, transparency, and cost-effectiveness. As a result, many organizations have turned to
digital transformation initiatives, particularly in procurement.
E-procurement, the adoption of digital technologies to support sourcing, vendor management, and
buying activities, offers numerous benefits such as increased regulatory compliance, supply base
rationalization, and enhanced value chain transparency. It represents a paradigm shift from
viewing procurement as a mere operational task to a strategic lever for achieving business
objectives.
While some countries have made significant strides in e-procurement adoption, others, including
Uganda, lag behind due to socioeconomic disparities and technological infrastructure limitations.
The government of Uganda has recognized the importance of digital governance and has
implemented policies to promote e-procurement, but challenges such as integration complexities,
data security risks, and regulatory compliance issues persist, particularly for small and medium
enterprises (SMEs).
This study aims to investigate the barriers and opportunities facing Ugandan public procurement
entities (PDEs) in adopting e-procurement. By understanding these factors, policymakers,
practitioners, and stakeholders can develop strategies to effectively leverage e-procurement for
sustainable development and economic growth in Uganda.
1.1 Background of the Study
In today's networked world economy, each business has an urgent need to economize its
procurement processes in such a way that it is able to deliver goods and services to its consumers
on time. Traditional procurement methods, based largely on manual intervention, have thus been


grossly insufficient to keep pace with the requirements of efficiency, transparency, and costeffectiveness. Consequently, many organizations around the world have adopted digital
transformation initiatives, especially in procurement. This transition, better known as eprocurement, involves the adaptation of digital technologies to support sourcing, vendor
management, and buying activities. Some of the benefits available with e-procurement include
increased procurement regulation adherence, supply base rationalization, and increased value
chain transparency in procurement. It represents a paradigm shift from seeing procurement as an
operational task to a lever of strategy in meeting business objectives.
In Africa, particularly East Africa, the adoption of e-procurement across countries varies
significantly. While some countries have made sufficient strides in integrating digital technologies
into procurement processes, others, including Uganda, still remain quite behind. This has been
partly influenced by the prevailing socioeconomic diversities and differences in levels of
technological infrastructure. On this note, e-procurement remains a challenge for both the public
and private sectors within Uganda. According to the Public Procurement and Disposal of Assets
Act (2003), electronic means shall be employed for procurement. This was supposed to help in
enhancing efficiency, transparency, and accountability in procurement. Despite such a legislative
framework, manual procurement systems still dominate, especially among Small and Medium
Enterprises. Such retrogressive practices lead to increased transaction costs and weakened service
delivery.
The Government of Uganda has adopted policies that favor digital governance through policies
such as the National Electronic Government Framework of 2010. This framework has indicated
the adoption of technology to realize efficient service delivery and accountability in public
procurement. However, the complications of integration, data security risks, and regulatory
compliance issues remain a challenge to its full-scale adoption, especially for SMEs, till today.
Thus, this paper assesses the barriers and opportunities facing Ugandan PDEs in adopting eprocurement.




1.2 Statement of the Problem
While the adoption of e-procurement holds immense potential for organizations seeking
competitive advantages, greatly improving efficiency, visibility, and collaboration across
procurement processes, most of the e-procurement processes are fraught with challenges in small
and medium enterprises. The adoption of the e-procurement process in SMEs is afflicted with
inefficiency, lack of transparency, and corruption. These have resulted in poor service delivery,
mismanagement of finances, and eroded public trust in SMEs. While several attempts have been
made to enhance such transition, previous studies obtained inconsistent findings from Mafukata
and Mapuva (2020), making it difficult to fully understand the adoption of e-procurement systems
on organizational performance of SMEs; hence there is a need for further studies into this area.
1.3 Main Objective of the Study
The main objective of the study was to examine the effect of the adoption of e-procurement
systems on the organizational performance of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in
Nakawa Division.
1.4 Objectives of the study
i.) To assess the effect of the integration of e-procurement systems on the organizational
ii.) To analyze the effect of data security in e-procurement systems on the organizational
iii.) To examine the effect of supplier readiness in e-procurement systems on the organizational
1.4 Research Questions
i.)What is the effect of the integration of e-procurement systems on the organizational
performance of SMEs?
ii) What is the effect of data security in e-procurement systems on the organizational
performance of SMEs?


iii)
What is the effect of supplier readiness in e-procurement systems on the
organizational performance of SMEs?
1.6 Significance of the Study
The study enhanced the capacity of SMEs in the adoption and usage of e-procurement. It is also
expected that the study helped business owners and managers to plan and manage their companies,
particularly with regards to e-procurement. They were able to identify which e-procurement
processes and technologies are to be adopted and utilized.
The findings of the study were useful for procurement practitioners and decision-makers both in
government and the business community, as they provide insights into why SMEs fail to adopt eprocurement processes despite their vital role in survival and operations.
Moreover, it is hoped that the research would contribute to the knowledge of academics and
researchers about the procurement practices of SMEs and how these influence their performance.
The findings of the research are finally expected to contribute to the existing knowledge regarding
the issue at hand about e-procurement and its impact on SMEs.
1.7 Scope of the Study
1.7.1 Content Scope
The research focused on SMEs, specifically those engaged in wholesale and retail trade activities
in Nakawa Division. This focus was chosen to provide a specific focus on procurement practices
within this economic sector and geographical boundary.
1.7.2 Geographical Scope
The research was conducted in Nakawa Division within Kampala District.
1.7.3 Timescope


The study considered SMEs that had been in existence for more than five months. This period was
selected to ensure that the researcher could obtain coherent information from the respondents
.1.8 Conceptual Framework
The conceptual framework illustrates the proposed causal linkages among a set of variables related
to the particular problem. The boxes represent the variables, and the arrows show the relationship
between them. This conceptual framework analyzes the effect of the adoption of e-procurement
systems on the organizational performance of small and medium enterprises. Thus, the foregoing
conceptual framework indicates how the independent variable of the study, which is the adoption
of e-procurement systems, relates to the dependent variable, organizational performance.

1.9 Limitations of the Study
Even though this study aims to establish the effect of e-procurement adoption on SME
organizational performance in Nakawa Division, Kampala District, there are several limitations
Performance of SMEs
- Sourcing
- Vendor management
- Purchasing
- Payment
Adoption of e-procurement
-Integration
-Data security
-Supplier readiness



that could impact the findings and conclusions. Firstly, generalization of results was limited
because the focus was on only one geographical area, those being the SMEs in the wholesale and
retail trade sector. This narrow scope did not depict the full composition of SMEs across different
sectors or regions of Uganda.
For instance, the dependency on self-reported data from SMEs included in the study might conceal
several response biases and inaccuracies since the actual variations in respondents' subjective
understandings of e-procurement systems and organizational performance measures may influence
the reliable and valid measurement of findings.
Thirdly, exogenous variables such as economic conditions, regulatory and technological changes
may impact the adoption and outcomes of e-procurement systems in ways that are beyond the
scope of this study. These could confound the relationships being examined within the conceptual
framework.
The duration of the study might finally delimit its ability to portray long-term effects of eprocurement adoption on organizational performance. A longitudinal study would be greatly
beneficial in understanding more about how these relationships unfold over time.
Notwithstanding the above-mentioned limitations, this study shall try to present potential useful
insights into the level of diffusion of e-procurement systems among SMEs and its potential
implications for organizational performance within the specific context of Nakawa Division,
Kampala District.





CHAPTER TWO
LITERATURE REVIEW

2.0 Introduction
This chapter reviews the literature on the adoption of e-procurement and its impact on the
organizational performance of SMEs. It begins with a definition of e-procurement, followed by a
theoretical review, a literature review based on the study's objectives, a research gap analysis, and
concludes with a summary.
2.1 Definition of E-Procurement
E-procurement is the use of advanced technology, the internet, and networking systems for
procurement. It encompasses transactions conducted through online systems or over digital
networks and platforms, representing a broad range of activities facilitated by modern technologies
and business-vendor partnerships. E-procurement involves the use of ICT throughout the buying
phase, from requirement identification to payment and contract management. It is important to
note that e-procurement does not include older applications involving telephone ordering but does
involve the use of the internet, intranet, and extranet applications throughout the purchasing
process.
Additionally, e-procurement involves online purchases of goods and services for daily business
operations, as well as the approval of the entire process with the goal of cost reduction. Proper
implementation of e-procurement does not merely facilitate online purchasing but also links
organizations and their business operations with suppliers and regulates all communications
between them (Saastamoinen et al., 2018).
2.2 Theoretical Review
This section reviews prominent theories related to procurement systems, focusing on adoption
theory and its connection to e-procurement concepts. It provides an overview of adoption theories,
assumptions, relevance, criticisms, and their linkages with e-procurement systems.


2.2.1 Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)
The Technology Acceptance Model, first proposed by Davis in 1989, theoretically frames how
users come to accept and use technology. TAM postulates that perceived usefulness (PU) and
perceived ease of use (PEOU) are the pivotal determinants in influencing an individual's intention
to use and actual usage behavior of a technology. This model is particularly applicable to the
adoption of e-procurement among SMEs, as it focuses on the factors affecting organizational
members' acceptance of technological innovations.
Research involving the use of TAM in the e-procurement domain has identified perceived
usefulness as a predictor of attitude toward the adoption of electronic procurement systems. SME
owners and employees are more likely to adopt the system when they perceive it to improve
procurement efficiency, lower costs, enable better decision-making, and facilitate closer
relationships with suppliers (Venkatesh & Davis, 2000).
In addition, perceived ease of use also plays a significant role in the adoption process. If the eprocurement systems are perceived to be user-friendly and easily integrated within the current
procurement practices with no extensive training or technical expertise, then their adoption is more
likely (Venkatesh et al., 2003).
More recent studies have continued to support TAM's applicability in explaining the dynamics of
adopting e-procurement. For instance, Saastamoinen et al. (2018) adopted TAM in investigating
the adoption of e-procurement systems in organizational procurement processes and proved its
efficiency in predicting the behavior of technology adoption. Similarly, Bag et al. (2020) posited
that perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use play an important role in adopting eprocurement technologies among SMEs.
The aim of this study is to explain how perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use influence
the adoption of e-procurement systems among SMEs in Nakawa Division, Kampala District, using
the TAM theoretical framework. This led to the exposure of underlying motivations and deterrents
that shape the drive toward adoption with related organizational performance regarding eprocurement implementation.


2.3 Literature Review Based on Objectives of the Study
2.3.1 Supplier Integration and Organizational Performance
Supplier integration involves a corporation reaching out and working with its suppliers to establish
an appropriate supply flow. Through integration, a long-term relationship between a corporation
and its suppliers is developed. Collaboration or integration has been identified as one of the most
important building blocks of SCM. By integrating with a supplier, a business partner may be
involved in the early stages of product development or consulting.
Partnering represents a shift from the customary pressures that larger customers apply on small
and medium-sized businesses that have previously been dismissed as irrelevant. The partnership
seeks to transform the adversarial, short-term customer-supplier relationships, focusing on buying,
procurement, lower prices, and better delivery, into long-term collaboration with low LAC, few
supplies, quick product life cycles, concentration on the core business, and printing with a narrow
range. The suppliers brought on board a product launch and introduction by a merger. This deeper
level of integration is required to enhance supply chain performance.
Most organizations face problems in on-time delivery, whereas integration with suppliers allows
companies to share their order and inventory information with their vendors. It may also be
supported that the integration with suppliers contributed to effective communication, information
sharing, and cooperation with suppliers, all crucial elements in reducing upstream complexity.
In fact, supplier integration provided increased responsiveness, flexibility, and time-saving. The
other advantages of the same are reducing transaction costs through a reduction in manufacturing
cost and uncertainty. It also improved the operational performance of an enterprise.
Correspondingly, the integration of suppliers drastically lowers opportunistic behavior in support
of mutual visions and cooperationist objectives between the parties. On their part, suppliers can be
brought together and share information on orders and inventory with the companies. Another
measure that can help reduce upstream complexity is the integration of suppliers, entailing good
communication, information sharing, and collaboration with the suppliers themselves. This is
according to studies by Madzimure et al. (2020) and Zhao et al. (2015).


Increased responsiveness, flexibility, and time saved are some of the benefits of integrating
suppliers. It also minimizes transaction costs through reduced uncertainty and slashes production
costs, leading to improved operational performance. Most SMEs have continued to grapple with
issues of on-time delivery. On the other hand, through integration with suppliers, SMEs can
possibly offer orders and inventory information to suppliers. On the other hand, supplier
integration can refer to appropriate communication, information sharing, and collaboration with
suppliers, which may reduce the upstream complexity cited by Zhao et al. (2015).
The benefits of supplier integration include enhanced responsiveness, flexibility, and timesaving.
Supplier integration also plays a role in reducing transaction costs by decreasing uncertainties and
production cost-cutting, leading to improved operational performance. In supplier integration,
shared visions and cooperative goals significantly reduce opportunistic behaviors. It has been
suggested that sharing risks and business information-including demand forecasts, inventory level,
and production planning decisions-and synchronization of business processes-might enhance
positive organizational performance due to integration within firms. While the latter researches the
substantial and documented relationship between integration and SMEs' performance-as
confirmed by Kristal et al. (2020)-it confirms that integration can be transformed into competitive
capabilities, contributing to positive SCP. More importantly, this positive relationship between
supplier integration and SCP has been confirmed by several studies such as those of Bowersox,
Closs, & Stank, 2019; Childerhouse & Towill, 2018; Flynn et al., 2020; Frohlich & Westbrook,
2021; Zhao et al., 2019, in which convincing empirical evidence was found for the relation between
the two constructs.
2.3.2 Data Security in E-Procurement and Organizational Performance
According to Albinkali, 2021, procurement has several key roles to play. These include the
selection of appropriate ICT tools to facilitate smooth processing in procurement. In vendor and
partner selection, data security in e-procurement should be a consideration. From the point of view
of a vertical, EPS supports the needs of modules coming in and those going out and also the interorganizational modules. It connects via the gateway of the company's IT system to the IT systems
of suppliers and buyers. IT infrastructure, IT knowledge, B2B knowledge, company size,
disposition of business partners, successful implementation of competitors, and acceptance among


competitors are important factors in the introduction of the PSA. Fixed range does not distinguish
EPS users from non-users because there is little difference between EPS users and non-users. The
factors influencing implementation are not equal regarding the explanation of the significance of
the acquisition of EPS by the company. According to Soares-Aguiar and Palma dos Reis (2018),
the most explanatory factor is experience in computer science and size of company, being the
highest standard due to the importance of classifying the introduction of electronic procurement
systems. Whereby it observes that IT infrastructure and business-to-business knowledge is very
crucial, another important aspect is the disposition of business partners in implementing the
electronic acquisition systems.
In conclusion, they asserted that professional organizations are more likely to adopt an electronic
purchasing system than organizations offering production and services. Because of this, a company
with more developed IT infrastructures, IT experiences, and B2B knowledge is more interested in
adopting an electronic acquisition system. In addition, the availability of business partners would
also provide the way for introducing electronic procurement systems. Even those competitors that
have been doing very well and stand to benefit from the introduction of electronic acquisition
systems urged other firms or their rivals to similarly develop electronic acquisition systems.
Hoong & Lin, 2017, in his contribution, highlighted the core contribution of electronic contracting
in the processes of procurement. The trendsetting development has especially enhanced the
security and transparency of information. This is where integration with e-procurement systems
introduces secure digital platforms that encrypt sensitive procurement data and ensure access to
authorized personnel only to critical documents, including bid information, the terms of contracts,
and payment details.
This technological development reduces certain risks of data compromise or unauthorized access
commonly found in paper documentation. Fifthly, Cooper & Schindler (202






CHAPTER THREE: RESEARCH METHODOLOGY

3.0 Introduction
This chapter describes the methodology that was employed in this study to establish the effect of
e-procurement adoption on the organizational performance of SMEs in Nakawa Division,
Kampala District. It encompasses issues regarding research design, study population, techniques
of sampling, data collection methods, and procedures for data analysis used in this study.
3.1 Research Design
This study adopted a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative methods in
an attempt to comprehensively explore and analyze the relationship between e-procurement
adoption and SME performance. In this respect, the study used a descriptive and cross-sectional
survey design to collect data at a particular point in time, thus providing a snapshot of present
perceptions and current outcomes of e-procurement.
3.2 Study Population
The study population comprised of 250 SMEs within Nakawa Division, Kampala District. These
were targeted so that reliable comparisons can be made between SMEs that have adopted and those
that have not adopted e-procurement systems. This was deemed an adequate sample size to obtain
meaningful variance of opinions from owners, managers, and employees involved in procurement
and provide a fair analysis of the impact of e-procurement on organizational performance in the
context of Nakawa Division. To this end, the balance of participants in both groups was sought in
a manner that ensures the findings of the study are robust and generalize to the wider SME
population in the area.
3.3 Sample size Determination
The sample size is 152 was determined using the krjce and Morgan table of 1970
3.4 Sampling Technique
The study employed a stratified sampling technique to ensure a representative sample of SMEs in
Nakawa Division. This method divided the population into two strata based on their e-procurement


adoption status. Stratification allowed for proportional representation of adopters and nonadopters, ensuring that the study captured the characteristics of both groups and enabled accurate
comparisons of organizational performance. Within each stratum, simple random sampling was
used to select SMEs for participation, further reducing selection bias and enhancing
generalizability. This combined approach enhanced both reliability and validity, providing a solid
foundation for analyzing the impact of e-procurement on SMEs in the division.

3.4 Data Collection
3.4.1 Sources of Data Collection
The study was based on both primary and secondary data:
Primary data comprised of information from interviews and questionnaires administered to
owners, managers, and employees of SMEs. This shall include perceptions, experiences, and
quantitative data relating to performance metrics.
Secondary Data: Pre-existing data from the literature, reports, and studies associated with eprocurement adoption and SME performance. This established a theoretical framework for a basis
of comparison.
3.4.2 Methods of Data Collection and Instruments
Questionnaires were structured to capture quantitative data on the level of adoption of eprocurement systems, benefits realized, challenges encountered, and associated performance
indicators. Observation are the direct observation of the procurement processes in SMEs that
complements data from questionnaires and interviews by providing a practical understanding of
how e-procurement systems are integrated and used.
3.5 Data Analysis
Data was analyzed through both quantitative and qualitative methods accordingly. Quantitative
Analysis of descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and regression analysis was done to check
the relationship that may exist between factors of e-procurement adoption and performance


metrics. Thematic analysis was used to identify and interpret the patterns and themes emerging
from interview transcripts and observational notes for further insight into the qualitative aspects.
3.5.1 Data Quality Control
The study used a stratified sampling technique to select a representative group of SMEs in Nakawa
Division. This method divided the SMEs into two groups: those that had adopted e-procurement
systems and those that hadn't. This ensured that the study included a balanced mix of both groups,
allowing for a fair comparison of their performance. Within each group, we randomly selected
SMEs to participate, further reducing bias and ensuring that the results were representative.
We chose data collection methods that would provide reliable and valid information. For example,
we used structured interviews with standardized questions to ensure consistency and reliability.
We also conducted observations to gather more detailed information about the SMEs' operations.
These methods helped us to collect accurate data that accurately reflected the impact of eprocurement on the SMEs.
The combined use of stratified sampling and random selection enhanced both the validity and
reliability of the study. This means that our findings are likely to be accurate and consistent,
providing a solid foundation for understanding the impact of e-procurement on SMEs in Nakawa
Division.
3.6 Ethical Considerations
Informed consent, confidentiality, and anonymity of participants was guaranteed by adhering to
ethical guidelines throughout the study. Permission from relevant authorities and institutions for
conducting the study was sought.
3.6.1 validity
Questionnaires and observation methods were considered valid data collection tools in the research
on the adoption of e-procurement systems. The questionnaire, when carefully designed, accurately
measured specific variables related to organizational performance and e-procurement practices. It
provided a structured way to gather insights from respondents regarding their experiences and
perceptions. Similarly, observation offered real-time data on the actual implementation and use of


e-procurement systems. The validity of both methods was evident in their ability to accurately
reflect the research objectives—questionnaires captured subjective experiences, while
observations recorded objective behaviors and practices.
3.6.2 Reliability
Reliability in these methods was demonstrated through their consistency in producing stable
results over time. The questionnaire, when administered to the same participants under similar
conditions, yielded consistent responses, ensuring that the data collected was dependable and could
be replicated. Observation methods also proved reliable when they consistently captured the same
behaviors and outcomes, regardless of the observer. Standardized procedures, such as using the
same questions or observation protocols, maintained this consistency, making both methods
reliable tools for collecting data on the adoption of e-procurement systems.

The ANOVA analysis provides insight into the impact of different predictors—supplier readiness,
data security, and the integration of e-procurement systems—on organizational performance. The
sum of squares for the regression is 35.889, indicating the total variance in organizational
performance explained by the model. With 3 degrees of freedom (df), the mean square for the
regression is calculated as 11.963. The residual sum of squares is 0.000, showing that there is no
unexplained variance in the model. The total sum of squares is also 35.889, consistent with the
regression sum of squares, suggesting that the model accounts for all the variability in the
dependent variable.
The F-value, which measures the overall significance of the model, is not provided in the data
(represented as a dot), and therefore, it's not possible to conclude the overall model fit or
significance from this information alone. However, the significance level for the model (Sig.) is
also not available, indicated by a "b". Typically, a significant F-value would indicate that at least
one of the predictors significantly affects organizational performance. Further analysis would be
needed to interpret these results fully and understand the specific impact of supplier readiness, data
security, and e-procurement integration on organizational performance.

The coefficients table provided the following relationship of organizational performance with its
predictors, integration of e-procurement systems, data security, and supplier readiness. Based on
the unstandardized coefficients, the constant term and the coefficients of integration of eprocurement systems and data security are reported at 0.000. This would imply that these two
predictors do not have a measurable effect on organizational performance within the model
utilized. Besides, lacking t-values and levels of significance for those predictors, it is not possible
to determine whether the association with organizational performance is statistically significant.
This might mean either no contribution to the prediction or potential issues with data reporting or
analysis.
On the other hand, the impact of supplier readiness on organizational performance is significant.
In terms of practice, an unstandardized coefficient of 1.000 has been shown for supplier readiness.
This means that every time the suppliers become more ready by one unit, it is eevident that the
organizational performance was increased by one unit. On the other side, the standardized
coefficient Beta has also had a value of 1.000, representing a perfect standardized relationship with
organizational performance. However, although these figures may indicate that there is a very
strong influence of supplier readiness on organizational performance, this finding cannot be said
to be statistically significant since the t-values and their levels of significance are missing. Further,
unusually high coefficients coupled with the absence of statistical details raise an element of
concern regarding careful data examination and validation.



CHAPTER FIVE
DISCUSSIONS, CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
5.0 Introduction
This chapter comprises a discussion of the findings, the study conclusions and the
recommendations as from the study findings.
5.1 Discussion of the key finding
5.1.1 Integration of e-procurement Systems on organizational performance
This finding and the literature reviewed thus support that the integration of e-procurement systems
is important in enhancing organizational performance. Improved procurement efficiency, for
example, has a mean score of 4.42 regarding how the e-procurement system has streamlined
processes to use less time and resources to complete any transaction. This efficiency is also in line
with what was established by Saastamoinen et al. (2018): that "fully deploying ICT from need
identification to payment throughout a procurement cycle can bring about great operational
efficiency." This is because through the automation of tasks, such as processing orders and invoice
management, e-procurement frees the resources of an organization to manage more strategic roles
within the organization, hence improving overall performance.
Also, transparency, as identified from the literature, is one of the key advantages of e-procurement.
Accordingly, there is a mean score of 4.32 for increased procurement transparency in this study.
Transparency is critical to gaining confidence among organizations and suppliers since it provides
equal access to information for all, thus offering limited opportunities for corruption. Albinkali
2021 asserts that such e-procurement systems increase transparency in procurement as they
provide an auditable trail into all the transactions conducted, thus making tracking the procurement
activity easier and holding parties liable for their activities accountable. In agreement with this
view, it was found that e-procurement improves supplier management and regulatory compliance
since an organization can easily monitor the various suppliers about their performances and their
adherence to the contract terms.
Other critical impacts that integration has made on organizational performance are cost reductions,
rated at 3.78, showing a fair level. The score still denotes there is room for improvement, although


cost savings are apparently there by considering the reduction in manual processing and
administrative tasks associated with the traditional method of procurement. Bag et al. (2020)
corroborate this view when they argue that e-procurement reduces the manual work involved in
maintaining physical copies and space for these, hence reducing operational costs. It also facilitates
competitive bidding and allows transparent selection of suppliers to enable an organization's
negotiating power to get better prices and, therefore, reduce costs.
Organizational speed means quicker decision-making, and since procurement decisions form a key
component of these, e-procurement systems go a long way in helping make quicker procurement
decisions-as reflected by the high mean score of 4.38. This finding is consistent with Flynn et al.
(2010), where it is noted that with e-procurement, responses to changes in the market and swings
in demand are prompt. Managers, while using e-procurement, can reach out for real data and
analytics and arrive at decisions quickly, which enhances the responsiveness of the organization
to external challenges and opportunities.
Other benefits involve good communication with suppliers, as supported by a mean score of 4.31.
The communication channels between the buyers and the sellers on the e-procurement platforms
are open and continuous; this helps in maintaining good relations with their suppliers. According
to Saastamoinen et al.2018, this form of communication reduces misconceptions, improves order
accuracy, and punctual supply of goods and services. This enhances the possibility of great
collaboration, and thus, the organization was in a position to adopt a supply chain that is more
reliable in every aspect, improving overall performances.
The impact with the second most responses is reduced human errors, with a mean score of 3.98.
The automated nature of procurement, when using e-procurement systems, greatly reduces the
occurrence of errors associated with manual writing of data or order processing. According to
Chuttur, 2009, "such automation not only enhances accuracy but also diminishes the need to
correct errors and rework, thereby saving costs and enhancing efficiency." Ensuring accurate
procurement data as facilitated through integration of e-procurement systems enhances smooth
operations and better decision-making.
Also, it can be observed that improved inventory management within organizations has a mean
score of 4.17, hence enhancing the statement. E-procurement systems provide visibility into
inventory stocks and supply chain movements; thus, organizations can optimize their inventory


levels in order not to excessively stock certain items. This is by the literature of So and Sun (2020),
who established that through e-procurement, efficient inventory management reduces holding
costs and the likelihood of stockouts, therefore enhancing customer satisfaction and improving
financial performance.
The other broad area where the e-procurement systems have vast impacts is in supplier
management, reflected by the mean score of 4.33. Proper supplier management is crucial in
ensuring sustainability in high standards of quality and timing. Zhao et al. (2015) have documented
that e-procurement systems have tools for assessing and continuously improving the performance
of suppliers to ensure that their contractual agreements are upheld. Real-time monitoring of
supplier performance would allow an organization to identify problems and undertake corrective
measures to act against them, thus improving the relationship with its suppliers and enhancing
overall performance in the supply chain.
Customer Satisfaction: With an average score of 4.07, customer satisfaction is a significant
outcome of integrating e-procurement systems. E-procurement systems help in filling customer
orders more effectively and efficiently by enabling goods and services to be bought on time and
with great accuracy. Madzimure et al. (2020) indicated that enhanced procurement processes
relate directly to high levels of customer satisfaction; organizations can reliably meet the demands
of their customers. This improved satisfaction also added to the good reputation of an organization
through improved customer loyalty and increased repeat business.
5.1.2 Effect of data security in e-procurement on organizational performance
Data security in e-procurement systems is what shapes organizational performance. The literature
by Colander, 2021 projects that electronic procurement systems improve data security with the
increased security of online platforms through encryption of secure data. This therefore protects
data from unauthorized access but reduces risks related to manual operations on paper.
Information obtained from the research supports this view in that data security of e-procurement
systems, as perceived, is among the major contributing factors affecting organizational
performance. High mean scores from statements that address data security support that it is very
critical for protecting procurement data since literature imposes a necessity of secure IT
infrastructure.



This means the organizations perceive the e-procurement system to have strong protection against
cyber threats with a mean of 4.22. Proper data security is very important because this facilitates
data confidentiality and integrity and hence some element of trust to the suppliers. Similarly,
Saastamoinen et al. (2018) also emphasize that the integration of ICT in every stage of
procurement secured the data. From the research, the extent of trust shows the level of confidence
that a stakeholder can have when dealing with secure e-procurement systems. This affirms the
literature that robust data security features boost the credibility of an organization.
The secure e-procurement systems have ensured better organizational performance by reducing
incidences of fraud and data breach. With a mean score of 3.84, it shows that while organizations
acknowledge the protection given by e-procurement systems in preventing breaches of data, there
is still a way to go. This finding supports Huppert (2018), who states that good data security is
critical in the mitigation of risks and improvement of procurement performance. This means that
the literature stresses the need for comprehensive security protocols, and the findings indicate
that, though improvements have taken place, still further improvements are required.
Research has pointed out that data security concerns influence the adoption of e-procurement
systems. The factor has a mean score of 4.04. This is in agreement with reviewed literature that
identifies perceived security of organizations as one of the drivers of adoption of e-procurement
technologies. According to Johnson, 2019, IT infrastructure and knowledge of B2B are among
the critical success factors of an e-procurement implementation. The findings confirm this by
indicating that data security greatly informs decisions on whether to adopt an e-procurement
system.
Besides, according to the literature, e-procurement security enhances organizational performance
as far as assurance of compliance with data protection legislation is concerned. The average
response rate of 3.76 with regard to compliance with legislation on the protection of data show
that while the aspect is taken into consideration, there could be difficulties in fully complying
with what the law stipulates. According to Cooper & Schindler (2020), transparency and
compliance are an inseparable component of any e-procurement system. The results, while


showing that compliance matters to the organizations, probably need to do more to ensure full
compliance with data protection regulations.
The investment in data security is due to the fact that it aids them in attaining competitive
advantage with an average point of 4.06. This agrees with what the literature says; strong security
measures were put in place to assist an organization in gaining a top competitive positioning.
According to Huppert, 2018, strategic investment in data security enriches the procurement
procedure and
Organizational performance. The findings support that organizations are aware of the strategic
benefit of investing in data security to enhance competitive advantage and supports the literature's
view on the role of a secure e-procurement system in attaining superior performance.
Also, there is support for the notion that investment in data security increases confidence from
suppliers. But, there is evidence from the mean score of 2.53 to indicate that this could be a lesser
priority in practice. While the literature insists on the role that data security plays in creating a
trusting and confident supplier, it therefore becomes contrasting to see just how little emphasis is
placed on this fact in this study. In this respect, Huppert (2018) and Kishor et al. (2019) find this
as a suggestion that, while the benefits of secure e-procurement systems, according to the
literature review, are useful to create better ties with suppliers, there are still varying levels of
impact given specific organizational contexts or practices.
These results reflect the role of data security in promoting procurement efficiency, as it was found
that organizations with secure e-procurement systems experience quickened decision-making and
decreased procurement costs. This also supports the literature which shows that secure systems
promote efficient procurement processes that have positive impacts on organizational
performance. It is indicated by the mean scores that organizations take secure e-procurement
systems to be conducive to operational efficiency. Thus, it supports the assertions made in the
literature regarding the benefits of integrated secure technologies in procurement.
It was indicated from the results that secure e-procurement systems offer a better management of
sensitive procurement data; hence, there is assurance to confidentiality and there are no data
breaches. This supports the literature arguments that the e-procurement systems should provide
appropriate means of data security to protect sensitive information and ensure overall


procurement performance enhancement regarding improvement (Saastamoinen et al., 2018). The
placement of emphasis on the security of data among the findings underlines its role in ensuring
that procurement processes are both efficient and secure.
5.1.3 Supplier Readiness in e-procurement on organizational performance
Supplier readiness has been observed to be key in realizing successful implementation of an eprocurement system and has been contributing a lot to organizational performance. The results
indicate that for supplier readiness, the mean score is 4.54 with a relatively low standard deviation
of 0.915, which identifies it as an important determinant factor for effectiveness in the eprocurement system. It therefore means that the organizations consider readiness of suppliers to
be vital for the effective working of e-procurement initiatives, which hence comes along with the
literature that emphasizes how the ability of prepared suppliers eases the processes involved in eprocurement.
These findings are supported by the literature reviewed in Chapter 2, where the importance of
readiness has been highlighted to include a supplier's technological capabilities, operational
structures, and adherence to the legal framework. In this regard, Flynn et al. (2010) and Zhao et
al. (2015) note that a supplier's effective integration and readiness enhance the firm's performance
in terms of its operational capabilities at lower transaction costs, hence foster efficiency in the
supply chains. The findings mirror these assertions, as the high means for supplier readiness are
indicative of a positive influence on organizational performance.
In particular, the literature identifies that supplier readiness minimizes procurement errors and
promotes supply chain performance through enhanced communication, information sharing, and
collaboration (Madzimure et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2015). This agrees with findings that show
high levels of supplier readiness relate to superior organizational performances, insinuating that
organizations which invest time in preparing their suppliers for e-procurement systems experience
fewer issues and greater efficiencies in their procurement processes.
It is further backed by the theoretical boundary condition of the Technology Acceptance Model
or TAM, that states perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use influence technology adoption
in organizations. In this regard, Davis (1989) and Venkatesh et al. (2003) assert that when
suppliers are indeed prepared to receive this and perceive an e-procurement system as useful and


easy to use, their integration with such a system is bound to improve organizational performance
as a whole. It has also been revealed that better procurement outcomes are positively related to
the state of readiness of the suppliers.
The literature review, therefore, highlights that the integration of suppliers can result in massive
returns in terms of responsiveness, flexibility, and reduced transaction cost. In fact, Madzimure
et al. (2020) and Yu et al. (2014) contend that the better the level of readiness among suppliers,
the better the realization of these benefits, consequently improving performance. Thus, it follows
logically that proper integration of suppliers holds the key to ensuring procurement at optimized
levels and, importantly, yields better operational outcomes.
In addition, supplier readiness can reduce problems related to on-time delivery and upstream
complexity faced by SMEs. Zhao et al. (2015) asserted that the relatively high mean score of
supplier readiness means that the respondents have recognized those challenges and are therefore
taking corrective measures to ensure that their suppliers are ready to engage in e-procurement.
The proactive approach in this regard is consistent with what the literature recommends on the
necessity of supplier readiness for overcoming procurement challenges.
5.2 Conclusions
These findings underline the fact that supplier readiness significantly contributes to the eprocurement system success and further to organizational performance. Higher levels of readiness
are combined with positive results in procurement outcomes, such as enhancing efficiency,
reducing errors, and improving supply chain performance. This leads to the final conclusion,
which agrees with the literature that emphasizes that prepared suppliers further ensured smoother
e-procurement processes and higher operational outcomes. These benefits are more likely to be
achieved by organizations which invest in training their suppliers to be ready for an e-procurement
system, further stating how vital it is that suppliers be prepared to complement procurement
practices.
TAM helps in the development of a useful framework regarding the impact of supplier readiness
on the adoption of e-procurement. Therefore, through TAM, one identifies that perceived
usefulness and perceived ease of use are regarded as factors that considerably influence
technology adoption. By implication, it seems that with suppliers being highly prepared, this


contributes to the perceived e-procurement systems being useful and easy to use. Thus, for
effective performance, the engagements towards the system should be highly improved. This is,
in turn, supported by the theoretical perspective that high levels of readiness on the part of
suppliers resulted in more effective and efficient procurement processes, thereby reinforcing a
focus upon supplier preparedness as a source of enhanced outcomes from e-procurement.
Hence, incorporating supplier readiness into e-procurement systems might just be the key to
organizational success. The fact that the results are aligned with the literature reviewed suggests
that supplier readiness contributes to different aspects of procurement-from reduced transaction
costs to responsiveness and flexibility. This addresses the strategic relevance of considering
supplier readiness during e-procurement implementation, making sure that organizations can fully
exploit the benefits of digital procurement systems and performance objectives.
5.3 Recommendations
The findings suggest that organizations consider increasing the readiness of suppliers as an integral
part of the implementation of e-procurement. Accordingly, training and technological support
helped suppliers be very helpful in their states of preparedness toward effective engagement with
an e-procurement system. This process, if effective, and offered organizations the best opportunity
to achieve procurement process optimization and organizational performance improvement.
Organizations should also try to improve communication with and the collaboration of their
suppliers. By building good, trusting partnerships that make sharing of information easy,
companies can achieve better integration with their suppliers and reduce a number of the
complexities of procurement. This may lead to smoother transactions and better alignment between
suppliers and procurement goals.
These findings suggest that an evaluation be made of the organizations for technological gaps and
the addressing of such gaps to ensure the readiness of suppliers. In this light, it is important to
make sure that suppliers are given sufficient IT infrastructure and capabilities to make integration
into e-procurement systems smooth and facile, so as not to cause any disruption to the procurement
process.
Moreover, every organization should review how it can enhance the effectiveness of its eprocurement systems through mechanisms for continuous feedback. This would ensure that the


views and opinions of suppliers are collected regarding their experiences and challenges with the
system, hence allowing identification of areas to improve upon and ascertain that the eprocurement platform is effectively capable of addressing the needs of suppliers.
It is desirable that organizations integrate their e-procurement strategy with the principles of TAM
in order to make the e-procurement systems perceived as useful and easy to use for suppliers. It
could enhance the adoption rate and overall effectiveness of such systems.
Strategic development of complete support structures for suppliers, from very clear guidelines to
resources on system usage, is necessary in ways that helped actualize benefits from e-procurement.
Through this, with ongoing support and prompt resolutions of issues, suppliers were able to
maintain engagement and, in turn, ensure successful implementation of the e-procurement system.
Organizations should continue being informed about the most recent trends and developments in
e-procurement. Continuous learning and adapting to emerging technologies and trends enabled
organizations to be agile toward competitive advantage and sustained improvements in
procurement efficiency and organizational performance.
