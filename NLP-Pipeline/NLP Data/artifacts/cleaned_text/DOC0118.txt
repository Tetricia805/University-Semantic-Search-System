CHAPT ER ONE: INTRODUCTION
1.0 Introduction
This chapter presents the risk management strategies in logistics and supply chain operations, it
cover the background to the study, statement of the research problem, purpose, objectives,
research questions, the hypothesis, scope, the significance or justification, limitations of the
study and definitions of terms to solve the research problem.

1.1 Background of the study
This covers the historical, theoretical, conceptual and contextual backgrounds.
1.1.1 Historical background
The historical background of risk management strategies in logistics and supply chain operations
has evolved as organizations recognize the importance of systematically addressing risks to
achieve sustained benefits. The concept of risk management emerged as a central part of
strategic management, aiming to mitigate risks associated with activities and processes. Poor
outsourcing and risks in the supply chain, such as operational risks, decision risks, and supplier
base reduction, have been identified as factors that can significantly impact organizational
profitability (Kwabena, 2005). The understanding of risk management processes and the
identification of various risks have evolved over time, leading to a comprehensive approach that
includes
risk
identification,
estimation,
analysis/assessment,
evaluation,
reporting,
communication, and monitoring/control (Bikker and Metzmakers, 2005).

The historical development of risk management in logistics and supply chain operations has
highlighted the defensive and offensive roles it plays in manufacturing firms. Effective risk
management is crucial for minimizing the impact of risks on organizational performance and
requires strong leadership and governance (Jorion, 2009). Recognizing risks and managing them
has become essential, as unidentified risks are considered riskier. Risk management extends
beyond specific areas, such as sourcing, stockpiling, and insurance, to include supplier
development, contractual obligations, collaborative initiatives, and careful supplier selection
(Chopra and Meindl, 2007). The emphasis on risk management as a proactive strategy has
grown, reflecting the multifaceted and complex nature of risks and the need to manage them
rather than fear them (Payle, 1997; Greuning and Bratanovic, 1999).


The evolution of risk management in logistics and supply chain operations has necessitated
ongoing risk assessment and quantification to enhance organizational understanding and improve
performance. Organizations engage in rigorous analytical processes to identify and quantify
risks, allowing them to determine risk tolerance and allocate resources effectively (Kwabena,
2005). Implementing a reporting and review structure, conducting regular audits, and ensuring
compliance with policies and standards are essential components of effective risk management
(Ukandu, 2007). The outcome of successful risk management practices includes increased
confidence, quality assurance, resource allocation, disaster recovery and business continuity
planning, enhanced reputation, coordination with service and delivery patterns, increased
customer attraction, and improved profitability (Chapelle et al., 2004).

1.1.2 Theoretical background
Risk management is a critical component of an organization's strategic management, aimed at
addressing risks associated with its activities to achieve sustained benefits. Risks in the supply
chain and poor outsourcing can have a significant impact on organizational profitability
(Kwabena, 2005). These risks encompass operational risks, decision risks, supplier base
reduction, globalization, acquisition mergers, alliances, inertia, and just-in-time relationship
risks.
The
process
of
risk
management
involves
risk
identification,
estimation,
analysis/assessment, evaluation, reporting, communication, and monitoring/control (Bikker and
Metzmakers, 2005). This comprehensive approach ensures that risks are effectively managed to
minimize their impact on the organization's operations and profitability.

Effective risk management serves as both a defensive mechanism and an offensive weapon for
manufacturing firms, with the quality of leadership and governance playing a crucial role in its
implementation. It is essential to recognize and manage risks, as unidentified risks are inherently
riskier than recognized ones (Jorion, 2009). Risk management extends throughout various areas,
including sourcing, stockpiling, insurance, supplier development, contractual obligations,
collaborative initiatives, and careful supplier selection. By implementing robust risk management
strategies, manufacturing firms can proactively address potential risks, mitigate their impact, and
enhance their overall performance.



Assessing risks is an ongoing process that requires organizations to engage in rigorous analysis
and quantify risks. Senior management or the board of directors must determine the
organization's risk tolerance based on an assessment of potential losses (Kwabena, 2005).
Effective risk assessment allows organizations to better understand their risk profile and allocate
resources to target risk management measures that help mitigate risks and improve performance.
To ensure effective risk management, organizations need to establish a reporting and review
structure, conduct regular audits of policy compliance, and review performance to identify areas
for improvement. The monitoring process provides assurance that appropriate controls are in
place for the organization's activities, ensuring adherence to procedures (Ukandu, 2007).

1.1.3 The conceptual background
Risk management strategies refer to the systematic approaches and processes implemented by
organizations to identify, assess, mitigate, and monitor risks associated with their operations
(Ariane et al., 2004). These strategies aim to minimize the negative impact of uncertainties and
vulnerabilities on the achievement of organizational objectives. In the context of JMS, risk
management strategies would involve identifying potential risks in their logistics and supply
chain operations, evaluating their likelihood and impact, and implementing appropriate measures
to mitigate those risks.

On the other hand, logistics and supply chain operations encompass the activities involved in
managing the flow of goods, services, and information from the point of origin to the point of
consumption (Christopher & Lee, 2004). This includes procurement, transportation,
warehousing, inventory management, and distribution processes (Chopra & Meindl, 2007). In
the case of JMS, logistics and supply chain operations would revolve around ensuring the timely
and efficient delivery of medical supplies and pharmaceuticals to various healthcare facilities.

Effective risk management strategies are vital for optimizing the performance and resilience of
logistics and supply chain operations (Christopher & Lee, 2004). By identifying and addressing
potential risks, such as disruptions in transportation, delays in procurement, or inventory
shortages, organizations like JMS can enhance the efficiency, reliability, and overall
performance of their logistics and supply chain processes. Furthermore, robust risk management


strategies can help mitigate financial losses, maintain customer satisfaction, and ensure the
availability of essential medical supplies, contributing to the organization's overall success and
impact in the healthcare sector (Chopra & Meindl, 2007). The relationship between risk
management strategies and logistics and supply chain operations in the context of JMS
Headquarters is symbiotic. Implementing effective risk management strategies within logistics
and supply chain operations enables JMS to proactively address potential risks and uncertainties,
leading to improved operational efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and better service delivery to
healthcare facilities and patients.

1.1.4 Contextual background
The logistics and supply chain operations in Uganda, like in many other countries, face
significant risks and challenges that can hinder their efficiency and profitability. Uganda, being a
developing nation in East Africa, has experienced substantial economic growth and
industrialization, resulting in increased demand for effective logistics and supply chain
management. However, inadequate risk management strategies in this sector have led to various
issues such as supply disruptions, inventory management problems, transportation delays, and
escalated costs (Christopher, 2005; Kwabena, 2005). These challenges have hampered the
overall performance of logistics and supply chain operations in Uganda.

One specific case study that exemplifies the need for research on risk management strategies is
the Joint Medical Stores Headquarters in Nsambya, Uganda. Joint Medical Stores is a crucial
organization responsible for the distribution of medical supplies and pharmaceutical products
across the country. However, the organization has encountered challenges such as stockouts,
inaccurate forecasting, poor inventory management, and supply chain disruptions (Kakuru, 2004;
Niringiye, Luvanda & Shitundu, 2010). These issues not only hinder the availability and
accessibility of vital medical supplies but also result in increased costs and compromised
healthcare services.

Given the prevailing situation in Uganda's logistics and supply chain operations, there is a
pressing need to investigate and develop effective risk management strategies. The identified
challenges, including poor forecasting, stockouts, and supply chain disruptions, underscore the


importance of gaining a comprehensive understanding of the risks involved and implementing
appropriate risk management practices (Bowen et al., 2001; Christopher & Lee, 2004).
Conducting this study will provide valuable insights and facilitate the development and
implementation of tailored risk management strategies that address the specific needs and
challenges of logistics and supply chain operations in Uganda.

1.2 Problem statement

CHAPTER TWO
LITERATURE REVIEW
2.0 Introduction
This chapter presents a comprehensive literature review, drawing on diverse sources from public
resource centers and the internet. The review is structured around three central themes: the
contribution of risk identification in logistics on supply chain operations, the role of risk
mitigation and control in logistics on supply chain operations and the relationship between risk
assessment and analysis in logistics on supply chain operations. Additionally, the study identifies
gaps in the existing literature to pinpoint areas that require further research.

2.1.1 Logistics and Supply Chain Operations
Abdullah et al. (2004) highlight the importance of extending the concept of supply chain to value
chains, emphasizing the need to consider the entire value creation process, from raw materials to
the end product. This approach enables a more holistic understanding of potential risks and
vulnerabilities within the supply chain. Allayannis et al. (2001) emphasize the significance of
managing exchange rate risk, particularly in East Asia, where currency fluctuations can
significantly impact logistics and supply chain costs. To address these risks, companies can
implement hedging strategies, such as forward contracts or currency swaps, to mitigate the
potential adverse effects of currency volatility.

In logistics and supply chain operations, companies should also focus on operational risk
management. Ariane et al. (2004) stress the implications of Basel II regulations on risk
measurement and management in the financial sector. While these regulations primarily apply to
banks, similar principles can be adapted to logistics and supply chain operations. Adopting sound
risk measurement methods and integrating contingency plans can help address operational
uncertainties and mitigate the impact of potential disruptions. Besner and Hobbs (2012) highlight
the paradox of risk management, where overly conservative risk avoidance strategies can hinder
innovation and competitiveness. Thus, companies should strike a balance between risk aversion
and risk-taking to optimize their supply chain performance while safeguarding against potential
pitfalls.



2.1.2 Inventory Management
Inventory Management plays a critical role in balancing production and demand to ensure
optimal levels of raw materials, work-in-progress, and finished goods. Efficient inventory
management minimizes holding costs and prevents stockouts or overstocking. Kakuru (2004)
emphasizes the need for companies to manage inventory effectively to avoid tying up capital in
excess inventory. Proper inventory control helps in aligning supply with demand and contributes
to improved supply chain performance.

2.1.3 Warehousing and Distribution
Warehousing and Distribution are key components of logistics and supply chain operations,
enabling efficient storage and delivery of products. Warehouses serve as storage facilities for
inventory management, and distribution centers facilitate the sorting and transportation of goods.
Effective warehousing and distribution practices help in timely deliveries and support
streamlined supply chain operations (Ritchie, 2007). Companies can optimize their inventory
flow and reduce lead times, leading to improved customer service levels. Proper coordination
between warehousing and distribution helps in reducing handling and transportation costs,
enhancing overall supply chain efficiency (Kakuru, 2004).

2.1.4 Demand Planning and Forecasting
Demand Planning and Forecasting are crucial in anticipating customer needs and aligning
production and inventory levels accordingly. Accurate demand forecasts allow companies to
avoid stockouts and excess inventory, leading to cost savings. Kwabena (2005) highlights the
importance of assessing risks in manufacturing firms, which includes demand uncertainties. By
adopting effective demand planning and forecasting techniques, companies can better plan their
production schedules and improve their overall supply chain efficiency.

2.1.5 Customer Service and Order Management
Customer Service and Order Management are essential for building strong customer
relationships and enhancing brand loyalty. Efficient order management systems, as highlighted
by Kakuru (2004), enable smooth order processing, timely deliveries, and effective


communication with customers. Exceptional customer service contributes to customer
satisfaction and repeat business, impacting a company's overall performance.

2.1.6 Transportation
Transportation is a vital element in supply chain operations, involving the movement of goods
between different locations. Efficient transportation management, as emphasized by Ritchie
(2007), ensures timely deliveries and cost-effective operations. By selecting appropriate carriers,
optimizing routes, and managing freight costs, companies can enhance their transportation
efficiency and contribute to a more responsive supply chain.

In a nutshell, logistics and supply chain operations are multifaceted processes that require
effective management of inventory, warehousing, demand planning, customer service, and
transportation. By implementing efficient practices and adopting proactive risk management
strategies, companies can optimize their supply chain performance and gain a competitive edge
in the market.

2.2 The contribution of risk identification in logistics on supply chain operations
The contribution of risk identification in logistics on supply chain operations has been a subject
of significant interest in the field of supply chain management. Logistics operations involve the
movement, storage, and distribution of goods, making them susceptible to various risks that can
disrupt the smooth flow of the supply chain. Studies such as Abdullah et al. (2004) and Besner
and Hobbs (2012) highlight the importance of risk identification in mitigating potential
disruptions and enhancing the overall efficiency of supply chain operations.

Effective risk identification enables supply chain managers to proactively assess and anticipate
potential risks, allowing them to implement appropriate risk management strategies. This
involves analyzing various factors, such as transportation delays, inventory management issues,
supplier reliability, and geopolitical risks, to name a few. By identifying these risks early on,
supply chain managers can develop contingency plans and implement risk-mitigating measures
to ensure the continuity of operations and minimize the impact of disruptions.


However, there are still gaps in the literature regarding risk identification in logistics and its
specific impact on supply chain operations. While some studies, like Chopra and Meindl (2003),
emphasize the significance of risk management in supply chain strategy and planning, there is a
need for more in-depth research that explores the specific methods and tools used for risk
identification in logistics. Furthermore, the effectiveness of risk identification in different types
of supply chains and industries needs further investigation to develop comprehensive risk
management strategies tailored to specific contexts.

Carvalho and Rabechini Junior (2015) argue that soft skills, such as communication and
collaboration, are essential for effective risk identification and management in projects. This
notion can be applied to logistics operations as well, as effective communication and
collaboration between supply chain stakeholders are crucial for identifying and mitigating risks.
Studies that delve into the role of soft skills in risk identification within logistics can provide
valuable insights into optimizing supply chain operations.

Another aspect that requires further exploration is the integration of emerging technologies, such
as big data analytics and artificial intelligence, in risk identification in logistics. Research by
Chapelle and Plane (2005) on the use of data envelopment analysis in measuring productive
efficiency in the manufacturing sector suggests that similar data-driven approaches can be
applied to logistics risk identification. Investigating the potential of advanced analytics in
enhancing risk identification and response strategies can significantly contribute to supply chain
optimization.

Additionally, research should focus on the identification and analysis of emerging risks and
uncertainties in logistics. With global markets becoming more interconnected and dynamic,
supply chains are exposed to a wide array of potential risks, including geopolitical tensions,
climate change impacts, and disruptive technologies. Investigating how logistics operations can
adapt to these emerging risks and uncertainties is crucial for building resilient supply chains.
Studies like Ariane et al. (2004) highlight the implications of Basel II on risk management in the
financial sector, emphasizing the importance of similar explorations in the logistics context.


Furthermore, the role of organizational culture and leadership in promoting a risk-aware culture
within logistics operations is another area worth exploring. Organizational culture plays a
significant role in shaping how risks are perceived, communicated, and managed. Leaders who
prioritize risk identification and encourage open communication about potential risks foster a
proactive risk management environment. Research by Allayannis, Brown, and Klapper (2001) on
exchange rate risk management in East Asia provides insight into the role of organizational
context in risk management. Investigating the relationship between leadership practices,
organizational culture, and effective risk identification in logistics can contribute to enhancing
overall supply chain resilience.

In conclusion, risk identification in logistics plays a critical role in supply chain operations by
enabling proactive risk management and enhancing overall efficiency. However, there are gaps
in the literature that warrant further research, including exploring specific risk identification
methods and tools, the role of soft skills in risk identification, and the integration of emerging
technologies in the process. Addressing these gaps can lead to a more comprehensive
understanding of the contribution of risk identification to logistics and supply chain operations,
ultimately leading to more resilient and optimized supply chains.

2.3 The role of risk mitigation and control in logistics on supply chain operations
The role of risk mitigation and control in logistics is crucial for ensuring the smooth and efficient
functioning of supply chain operations. Zheng, Yildiz, and Talluri (2015) emphasize the
significance of risk management in supply chains to identify potential threats and develop
strategies to minimize their impact. Risk mitigation involves implementing preventive measures
and contingency plans to reduce the probability of risks occurring and to handle them effectively
when they do. For instance, implementing robust inventory management practices can help
reduce the risk of stockouts or excess inventory, thereby enhancing supply chain efficiency.

One area that requires further research is the evaluation of different risk mitigation strategies and
their effectiveness in different industries and contexts. Ryan et al. (2013) discuss the empirical
performance of risk identification methods, but more studies are needed to assess the real-world
effectiveness of specific risk mitigation techniques. Investigating the challenges and successes of


risk control measures can provide valuable insights into refining and customizing risk
management strategies for various supply chain settings.

Moreover, the role of technology in enhancing risk mitigation and control in logistics should be
explored further. Krejcie and Morgan (1986) emphasize the importance of leveraging technology
for efficient operations. The integration of advanced analytics, artificial intelligence, and realtime monitoring can significantly enhance risk detection and mitigation capabilities in supply
chains. Research should focus on identifying suitable technological solutions and their potential
impact on supply chain performance.

Additionally, the influence of firm size on risk mitigation practices in logistics warrants
investigation. Niringiye, Luvanda, and Shitundu (2010) study firm size and technical efficiency
in East African manufacturing firms, but specific research is required to understand how
different-sized organizations approach risk mitigation in their supply chains. Smaller firms might
face unique challenges in implementing risk control measures, and studying their strategies can
offer valuable lessons for enhancing risk management practices across the supply chain
landscape.

Furthermore, exploring the role of collaboration and coordination among supply chain partners
in risk mitigation is essential. Ritchie (2007) highlights the importance of supply chain risk
management, but research on how effective communication and collaboration among
stakeholders can lead to better risk control is lacking. Investigating successful collaborative
efforts and their impact on supply chain resilience can help foster better risk management
practices among supply chain partners.

Further research is needed to explore the impact of cultural and regulatory factors on risk
mitigation and control in logistics. Allayannis, Brown, and Klapper (2001) discuss exchange rate
risk management in East Asia, but more comprehensive studies are required to understand how
cultural norms and regulatory frameworks influence risk management decisions in supply chains.
Different regions and countries may have varying approaches to risk control, and understanding


these nuances can help multinational organizations develop tailored risk management strategies
for their diverse supply chain networks.

Additionally, investigating the relationship between risk mitigation and supply chain
performance can provide valuable insights. Carvalho and Rabechini Junior (2015) highlight the
importance of soft skills in risk management, but there is a need to examine how effective risk
mitigation practices impact key performance indicators such as lead time, cost efficiency, and
customer satisfaction. Identifying the link between risk control measures and supply chain
performance outcomes can guide organizations in prioritizing their risk management efforts.

Furthermore, studies should delve into the role of top management support and organizational
culture in fostering a risk-aware supply chain environment. Besner and Hobbs (2012) discuss the
paradox of risk management from a project management perspective, but research specific to
supply chains can shed light on how leadership support and a risk-aware culture influence the
adoption and effectiveness of risk mitigation strategies. Organizations with strong top
management support and a culture that values risk awareness are more likely to prioritize risk
management efforts, leading to better outcomes in mitigating and controlling risks.

Moreover, a deeper analysis of the financial implications of risk mitigation in supply chains is
necessary. Bikker and Metzemakers (2005) discuss bank provisioning behavior and
procyclicality, but research should explore how different risk control strategies impact the
financial performance and stability of supply chain entities. Assessing the costs associated with
implementing risk mitigation measures and comparing them with potential savings from risk
reduction can help organizations make informed decisions about their risk management
investments.

2.4 The relationship between risk assessment and analysis in logistics on supply chain
The relationship between risk assessment and analysis in logistics plays a crucial role in ensuring
the smooth functioning and resilience of supply chain operations. According to Talluri, Kull,
Yildiz, and Yoon (2013), risk assessment involves identifying potential risks that could disrupt


supply chain activities, such as natural disasters, supplier disruptions, or demand fluctuations. On
the other hand, risk analysis involves evaluating the likelihood and impact of these identified
risks to prioritize and develop appropriate risk mitigation strategies. This relationship helps
supply chain managers to proactively address potential disruptions, reduce uncertainty, and
improve overall supply chain performance.

However, there are gaps in the literature regarding the integration of risk assessment and analysis
in logistics. While existing studies, such as those by Bowen et al. (2001) and Christopher and
Lee (2004), discuss risk management practices in supply chains, there is limited research on how
risk assessment findings inform the subsequent risk analysis process. Understanding the link
between the two phases can provide insights into how risk information is utilized to make
informed decisions and enhance the effectiveness of risk mitigation efforts.

Moreover, research is needed to explore the impact of risk assessment and analysis on supply
chain performance. Tummala and Schoenherr (2011) emphasize the importance of supply chain
risk management processes, but there is a lack of empirical evidence on how these practices
influence key performance indicators, such as cost efficiency, lead time, and customer
satisfaction. Examining this relationship can help supply chain managers identify the most
critical risks to target and allocate resources efficiently to improve overall supply chain
outcomes.

Additionally, there is a need to investigate the role of advanced technologies, such as artificial
intelligence and big data analytics, in enhancing risk assessment and analysis capabilities in
logistics. Srinivasan and Jeffrey (2017) introduce the concept of the supply chain immune
system, which leverages data-driven techniques to predict and respond to risks in real-time.
However, more research is required to understand the practical implementation and benefits of
such technologies in supply chain risk management.

Furthermore, exploring the cultural and organizational factors that influence risk assessment and
analysis processes is essential. Roger and Boudewijn (2006) discuss quality and risk
management issues, but there is limited research on how organizational culture and leadership


support impact the effectiveness of risk assessment and analysis practices. Understanding these
factors can help identify potential barriers to effective risk management and inform strategies to
foster a risk-aware organizational culture.

In summary, the relationship between risk assessment and analysis in logistics is crucial for
effective supply chain risk management. However, gaps exist in understanding how risk
assessment findings inform risk analysis, the impact of risk management on supply chain
performance, the role of advanced technologies in enhancing risk management capabilities, and
the influence of cultural and organizational factors. Addressing these gaps through further
research will provide valuable insights to enhance supply chain resilience and performance.

2.5 Summary of reviewed literature
The literature review on the contribution of risk identification in logistics to supply chain
operations revealed that effective risk assessment and analysis play a crucial role in enhancing
supply chain resilience and performance. Studies by Talluri et al. (2013) and Chopra and Meindl
(2007) emphasize the importance of identifying potential risks that could disrupt supply chain
activities and evaluating their impact. However, there are gaps in the literature regarding the
integration of risk assessment and analysis. Further research is needed to understand how risk
assessment findings inform the subsequent risk analysis process, which can provide valuable
insights into decision-making and risk mitigation strategies.

In the context of risk mitigation and control in logistics, the literature review highlighted the
significance of proactively addressing potential disruptions to ensure supply chain continuity.
Research by Besner and Hobbs (2012) and Carvalho and Rabechini Junior (2015) underlines the
importance of risk management practices in project and supply chain contexts. However, there is
a lack of empirical evidence on the impact of risk management on supply chain performance.
Closing this gap requires studying the relationship between risk management practices and key
performance indicators, such as cost efficiency and customer satisfaction.

Regarding the role of risk assessment and analysis in logistics on supply chain operations, the
literature review revealed that effective risk management processes are essential for improving


supply chain resilience. Studies by Srinivasan and Jeffrey (2017) and Ryan et al. (2013) highlight
the significance of advanced technologies in enhancing risk management capabilities. However,
there is limited research on the practical implementation and benefits of such technologies in
supply chain risk management. Addressing this gap requires further investigation into how
artificial intelligence and big data analytics can be leveraged to predict and respond to risks in
real-time.

In summary, the literature review underscores the importance of risk assessment and analysis in
logistics to ensure the smooth functioning and resilience of supply chain operations. The gaps in
the literature identified include the need for better integration of risk assessment and analysis,
understanding the impact of risk management on supply chain performance, exploring the role of
advanced technologies in risk management, and studying the influence of organizational and
cultural factors on risk management practices. Closing these gaps through further research will
provide valuable insights for enhancing supply chain resilience and performance.

This chapter presents the summary of findings, conclusions and recommendations. The summary
and recommendations are packaged according to the research objectives.
5.1 Summary discussion of findings
5.1.1 The contribution of risk identification in logistics on supply chain operations at Joint
The findings indicate that a majority of respondents (64.9%) have a positive perception of risk
identification in logistics. This aligns with the literature on risk management, particularly in
supply chain operations (Zheng et al., 2015). However, the presence of 11.9% of undecided and
23.8% of disagreeing respondents suggests that there may be a lack of understanding or concerns
regarding the effectiveness of risk identification. This emphasizes the importance of effective
communication and education in risk management (Carvalho & Rabechini Junior, 2015; Ryan et
al., 2013).

The majority of respondents (59.5%) acknowledge the value of assessing risks for prioritization,
which is consistent with the literature (Chopra & Meindl, 2007; Tummala & Schoenherr, 2011).
However, the presence of undecided (11.9%) and disagreeing (23.8%) respondents suggests a
need for clearer explanations or examples of how risk assessment directly contributes to
prioritizing risk management efforts. This highlights the importance of practical guidance in risk
assessment and management (Ritchie, 2007).

While a majority (64.2%) sees the value in reviewing historical data and trends for risk
identification, the relatively low percentage of strong agreement (4.7%) suggests reservations
among some respondents. This aligns with the literature's emphasis on the need for convincing
evidence or examples when implementing risk management practices (Kwabena, 2005; Chopra


& Meindl, 2007). It also underscores the importance of demonstrating the practical benefits of
historical data analysis.
The findings indicate that teamwork is considered important by the majority (63.9%) of
