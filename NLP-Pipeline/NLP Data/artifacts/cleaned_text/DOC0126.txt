ABSTRACT
This study explores the role of financial stewardship on church ministry within St.
Mark Kangarame Church, Nyakatare Deanery, Diocese of Kinkizi. The focus was on
understanding the biblical principles of financial stewardship, its impact on the
management of church resources, and the consequences of poor stewardship. Drawing
from both early church fathers' teachings and contemporary theological perspectives,
the research investigated how effective stewardship can enhance church growth by
promoting accountability, transparency, and responsible resource management. The
study identified practical measures to protect and improve stewardship practices,
contributing to the broader discourse on Christian stewardship and its role in the
mission of the church. The findings aim to offer theological insights and practical
guidance to church leaders, ultimately encouraging more faithful financial
stewardship in ministry in the Church of Uganda.

CHAPTER ONE
Introduction
1.0 Introduction
This section includes the study on financial stewardship and its relationship with
church ministry in the context of St. Mark Kangarame Church, Nyakatare Deanery, and
Diocese of Kinkizi. It presented the general introduction of the study.
1.1 Background of the Study
Financial stewardship refers to central aspect of Christian ministry and church
leadership. It involves the faithful planning, management, and use of money and
material resources that have been entrusted to the church and its members and,
ultimately, by God. In a Christian setting, financial stewardship is not simply an
administrative or accounting task—it is a spiritual discipline and responsibility. The
Bible teaches that how we manage worldly wealth reflects our spiritual maturity and
integrity. As stated in Luke chapter sixteen verses ten to twelve,Jesus affirms that
“whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much,” showing that
good stewardship is a test of faithfulness. In many churches, including St. Mark
Kangarame Church in Nyakatare Deanery, Diocese of Kinkizi, stewardship is expressed
through budgeting, transparent reporting, and the wise use of tithes, pledges, and
donations. These funds support ministry work such as preaching, helping the poor,
maintaining church property, and supporting evangelism. Poor financial management,
however, weakens both the church’s testimony and its ability to serve the community.

2 | P a g e

The roots of financial stewardship can be traced to the early church. In Acts 4:32–35,
early Christians shared their possessions and trusted the Apostles to distribute
resources fairly and responsibly. This community living was on one love, trust worthy
and stewardship. This act made church leaders responsible not only for spiritual
guidance but also for managing lands, money, and buildings, bringing new
expectations of accountability. In England, Thomas Cranmer, the Archbishop of
Canterbury during the Reformation, pushed for reforms in how church wealth was
used.
Many theories are in support with many concepts and in financial stewardship in the
church. one of Theories like the Agency defines stewardship as a trust-based
relationship where leaders act on behalf of many others for example God and the
congregation. Leaders in the church are expected to keep resources in a way that
reflects the interests of both the givers and the goals of the church. If leaders
mismanage resources, they become un trust worthy, leading to poor giving and very
weak participation. The Resource-Based View (RBV) says that resources, like
finances, are good for an organization's survival and growth and sustainability.
Good stewardship assumes that these resources are used efficiently and effectively to
achieve church goals. The Stewardship Theory in biblical values suggests that leaders
are motivated by a desire to serve and do well rather than by self-interest. This
theory teaches that trust, accountability, and alignment with the church’s mission.
Church leaders and accountability departments are caretakers, not owners, of church

3 | P a g e

property. They must act in line with biblical principles, demonstrating faithfulness in
both spiritual and material matters.
Within the Diocese of Kinkizi, financial discipline includes both opportunities and
challenges for example Churches like St. Mark Kangarame are important to their
communities, offering spiritual guidance as well as practical services such as
education, healthcare, and community development. In rural areas like Nyakatare
Deanery, challenges such as poverty, low education levels, and limited access to
financial tools affect how well stewardship is practiced. More so, cultural beliefs
discourage telling leaders about finances, creating a risk of not providing
accountability. Some Christians view leaders as above, which can lead to secrecy or
fear of transparency. At St. Mark Kangarame, trainings are being made to improve
stewardship through different workshops, introduction of online accounting systems,
and encouraging member involvement.
Faithful givers grow in trust, and leaders grow in integrity when they handle resources
honestly. These five principles are interrelated and must work together for effective
stewardship. When churches neglect these areas, they risk financial problems,
spiritual stagnation, and even conflict. When practiced faithfully, these concepts lead
to stronger churches and transformed communities.
Financial stewardship is helpful in both spiritual, physical growth of the church.
Spiritually, teaching about tithing, budgeting, and giving helps members understand
God’s provision and their role in His mission. It fosters a culture of generosity,
responsibility, and participation. Numerically, when churches manage resources well,

4 | P a g e

they attract more members. People are more likely to join and stay in a church where
leadership is trusted and transparent. Socially, churches with good financial practices
can provide better services—such as schools, clinics, and care for the poor—boosting
their influence and reputation. Structurally, stewardship leads to better planning,
improved facilities, and ongoing development. Church Fathers such as Clement of
Hippo taught that wealth should be used for righteous purposes. Reformers like
Thomas Cranmer insisted on transparency and justice in using church property. The
Edict of Milan introduced the idea of legal accountability in managing church assets.
Modern scholars like Sider (2015) and Kamanzi (2020) also argue that stewardship is
not just about economics—it reflects God's holiness. They call for ethical and
theological reforms that connect financial practices with biblical values. Thus,
financial stewardship is not only a church management issue—it is a theological
matter that affects the church’s witness, effectiveness, and future. In places like St.
Mark Kangarame, strengthening stewardship is a key pathway to growth, healing, and
spiritual transformation.
1.2 Problem Statement
The Church of Uganda, especially St. Mark Kangarame Church in Nyakatare Deanery, is
facing serious challenges in managing its resources. Good stewardship—using time,
money, and property wisely for God’s work—has not been well practiced. This has led
to poor financial management, misuse of church property, and a lack of
accountability. Some leaders have been accused of misusing funds and assets, causing
scandals that damage the church’s reputation. As a result, members have lost trust in

5 | P a g e

church leadership, which has affected attendance, giving, and ministry growth (Sider,
2015; Wright, 2006). Similar issues are present across the Diocese of Kinkizi, where
church land has sometimes been sold or misused without proper approval, and
financial records are often poorly kept. These problems weaken the church’s ability to
serve its members and community. However, solutions are possible. Leaders can be
trained in financial management and accountability Mugisha, (2019), and clear
policies on church resource use should be enforced. Regular audits, transparent
reporting, and stewardship education for members are essential steps Kamanzi,
(2020). This study seeks to examine these problems and offer practical solutions for
improving financial stewardship and restoring trust in church leadership.
1.3 Aim of the study
the study is to find out the importance of financial stewardship towards enhancing
church ministry at St. Mark Kangarame and to propose strategies for effective
stewardship practices that align with biblical principles and modern financial
management tools.
1.4 Specific Objectives

CHAPTER TWO:
LITERATURE REVIEW
2.0 Introduction
This presents existing past studied research of different scholars related to financial
stewardship and its impact on church ministry. The purpose is to provide a clear
understanding of what other scholars, theologians, and practitioners have written on
the subject. It explores key concepts, theoretical and practical views, and identifies
gaps that the current study aims to fill. The review draws from books, journals,
church reports, and academic studies to examine how financial resources are
managed in the church setting. It also considers the effects of poor financial
stewardship on church growth, trust among members, and the overall mission of the
church.
Christian stewardship gives important ace of sustainability of the church. Stewardship,
especially financial stewardship, is a crucial aspect of church administration, ensuring
that resources are effectively managed to support ministry work, social outreach, and
infrastructural development. In the line of the Church of Uganda, financial
stewardship is measured in theological and practical ways, influencing not only church
growth but also the ability to support clergy, construct places of worship, and helping
to support church missions.

2.1 The current status of financial stewardship at St. Mark Kangarame Church
Assessment of Financial Stewardship at St. Mark Kangarame Church
Financial stewardship is much important and is needed in supporting the growth,
operations and development of different activities. At St. Mark Kangarame Church,
understanding financial management is important to evaluating the church’s current
stewardship practices and ways. This section assesses various factors and ways that
influence financial stewardship in the church, drawing from relevant literature,
information and practical church-based records. These determinants include
leadership competence, accountability mechanisms, financial literacy, member
participation, institutional policies, use of technology, and cultural attitudes. Each of
these areas is reviewed to provide a light into the present state of financial
management at St. Mark Kangarame.
Leadership Competence and Integrity at St. Mark Kangarame
The usefulness of financial stewardship is mostly determined by the quality of
leadership and its effectiveness. Church leaders are responsible for planning budgets,
managing offerings, and ensuring accountability as far as financial stewardship is
concerned. At St. Mark Kangarame, leadership team is responsible to manage finances
is an important area of assessment. Van der Merwe and Pienaar (2011) show that
inadequate financial training among church leaders results in poor resource
allocation. It is good to evaluate whether leaders at St. Mark Kangarame have

10 | P a g e

received any form of financial management training and whether they demonstrate
integrity in handling church money.
Mwangi and Wanyoike (2014) note that ethical behavior among leaders directly
influence financial trust within the church and Christians. The absence of
transparency and ethical decision-making at St. Mark Kangarame can influence how
Christians give and support different ministries. Therefore, assessing the leadership’s
administrative skills and moral uprightness is important in evaluating financial
stewardship and management.
Accountability and Transparency Mechanisms
A key indicator of financial stewardship is how well a church practices accountability
and transparency. This involves asking: Are financial records at St. Mark Kangarame
regularly updated and shared with members? Are there proper audit systems and open
forums for financial reporting? Brinckerhoff (2006) recommends that churches
implement clear budgeting and auditing procedures. Mugisha (2019) found that
churches with routine financial meetings and report dissemination gained higher
levels of member trust.
Applying this to St. Mark Kangarame means evaluating whether such mechanisms are
in place. Does the church hold regular financial briefings? Are expenditures explained
to the congregation? Wright (2006) emphasizes that a lack of transparency discourages
giving and weakens trust. Therefore, this assessment should determine if current
systems at St. Mark Kangarame promote openness or secrecy.

11 | P a g e

Financial Literacy and Training
The financial understanding of both leaders and members directly affects how
resources are managed. At St. Mark Kangarame, it is important to assess whether
leaders have received any training in financial stewardship. Kamanzi (2020) points out
that many church leaders in Uganda operate without formal financial education,
increasing risks of mismanagement. The church’s current state can be evaluated by
checking for training workshops, seminars, or internal learning sessions.
Sider (2015) adds that financial literacy enables leaders to make better investment
decisions and helps members understand why giving matters. Therefore, assessing the
level of financial education among church members at St. Mark Kangarame is also
necessary to evaluate their stewardship culture.
Congregational Participation and Trust
Member involvement in financial decisions strengthens stewardship. This assessment
should explore how involved the St. Mark Kangarame congregation is in budget
planning, fundraising, and expenditure monitoring. Are members informed about how
money is used? Do they serve on finance committees or participate in review
meetings?
Osei-Tutu et al. (2014) found that member engagement increased financial giving and
volunteerism in Ghanaian churches. Mbugua (2017) also noted that when members see
results of their contributions—such as infrastructure or outreach—they gain more

12 | P a g e

confidence in church leadership. At St. Mark Kangarame, evaluating the degree of
member involvement and feedback channels will help measure the health of
stewardship.
Institutional Policies and Governance Structures
Effective stewardship relies on the presence of strong internal policies. Does St. Mark
Kangarame have documented financial guidelines, budgeting processes, or
procurement procedures? Brinckerhoff (2006) emphasizes that written policies protect
against misuse of funds. Mugisha (2019) found that Ugandan churches with financial
manuals had better accountability.
This assessment should identify whether the church has any formal structures for
managing resources and whether these are followed in practice. Governance
structures—such as parish councils or finance boards—should be evaluated to
determine if there is shared oversight or concentrated control. Wright (2006) stresses
that distributed governance leads to better financial accountability.
Use of Technology and Record-Keeping
Another area of assessment is how St. Mark Kangarame uses technology in managing
its finances. Does the church still use manual systems, or has it adopted software for
tracking income and expenses? Nyabwari and Bundi (2021) report that digital systems
enhance accuracy and transparency.

13 | P a g e

Evaluating the current tools used for financial management can reveal whether
recordkeeping is secure and efficient. Additionally, this section should explore
whether those responsible for finances have been trained to use such tools
effectively.
Cultural Attitudes Toward Giving and Financial Ownership
Cultural perceptions of money and authority also influence stewardship. In some
churches, financial control is seen as the private domain of church elders or clergy. At
St. Mark Kangarame, the assessment must consider how congregants view their right
to ask financial questions or participate in decision-making.
Mbugua (2017) notes that some African cultures discourage members from questioning
church authority, even in financial matters. This can lead to silence, even when
misuse is suspected. Assessing the culture at St. Mark Kangarame can help determine
whether members feel empowered to engage in stewardship or if cultural norms
inhibit openness.
Summary Assessment
In conclusion, the current state of financial stewardship at St. Mark Kangarame Church
can be effectively assessed through an evaluation of leadership quality, transparency
mechanisms, financial literacy, congregational engagement, existing policies,
technology use, and cultural attitudes. Literature shows that without strong systems
and trust-building practices, even churches with good intentions may face stewardship

14 | P a g e

challenges. This assessment aims to identify strengths and gaps in order to
recommend improvements that will strengthen responsible financial management and
support the long-term mission of the church.
2.2 Challenges of Financial Stewardship in Church Institutions: A Case of St. Mark
Kangarame Church
Church institutions, including St. Mark Kangarame Church, face numerous challenges
that hinder effective financial stewardship. Financial stewardship refers to the
responsible management and use of church resources—financial, material, and
human— in alignment with biblical principles and institutional goals (Barna, 2007).
However, when certain challenges are left unaddressed, the integrity, credibility, and
mission of the church can be seriously undermined. This section explores key
obstacles that affect financial stewardship in many churches, with practical
illustrations from the situation at St. Mark Kangarame Church.

Erosion of Trust and Lack of Transparency
When transparency in the management of funds is lacking, congregants begin to
question the integrity of their leaders. Wright (2006) states that trust is foundational
to financial stewardship and management in faith communities where giving is
voluntary. At St. Mark Kangarame Church, financial indiscipline and lack of open
communication about income and expenditures have led to member dissatisfaction
and withdrawal from active giving.

15 | P a g e

Mismanagement of Church Projects and Resources
Churches
always
depend
on
Christian
contributions
to
support
spiritual,
infrastructural, and social institutions. More so, a common challenge is the
mismanagement or poor planning of these projects and institutions. Kamanzi (2020)
states that project failures in churches are often rooted in weak financial controls. St.
Mark Kangarame has experienced delays in development projects due to poor
financial planning and execution, resulting in member frustration and a loss of
credibility and integrity.
Limited Financial Literacy Among Leaders
Many church leaders are chosen for their spiritual maturity rather than administrative
capability. While spirituality is crucial, managing modern church finances requires
basic skills in budgeting, reporting, and record-keeping. Kamanzi (2020) observes that
many church institutions in Uganda suffer due to financial illiteracy among clergy. This
challenge is evident at St. Mark Kangarame Church, where most financial decisions
are made without formal training or financial guidelines. The lack of capacity often
results in poor planning, misallocation of resources, and ineffective reporting.
Poor Motivation and Resource Allocation for Staff and Volunteers
Financial challenges also affect the morale of church workers and volunteers. When
salaries are delayed or ministry programs lack financial support, leaders and staff may
become demoralized. Barna (2007) notes that poor stewardship affects both
motivation and ministry effectiveness. At St. Mark Kangarame, volunteers have

16 | P a g e

expressed frustration due to the lack of clear budgeting for outreach activities and
ministry tools, which impacts evangelism and community service delivery.
Neglect of Church Assets and Property
Stewardship also includes the care of physical assets such as land, buildings, and
equipment. Poor management of these resources leads to disrepair, loss through
illegal sale, or misuse. In many churches, such neglect stems from unclear ownership
policies or the absence of maintenance plans. Mugisha (2019), suggests that church
land disputes in Uganda are often tied to unregulated land sales and poor
documentation and management. St. Mark Kangarame has faced similar concerns,
where land use decisions have been made without clear procedures or Christian
consultation.
Theological Misunderstandings of Stewardship
This challenge is how theology influences financial behavior and some churches
emphasize giving without equal emphasis on and stewardship and management. Sider
(2015) says that when biblical stewardship is reduced to seed sowing and blessings, it
opens room for manipulation. At St. Mark Kangarame, teachings on giving have not
always been matched with clear teachings about financial policies or reporting
practices.

17 | P a g e

Cultural Barriers to Financial Accountability
One of the cultural barriers is questioning church leaders about financial matters and
is considered disrespectful. This cultural mind set has discouraged congregants from
demanding transparency. Mbugua (2017) reveals that in parts of African countries,
cultural reverence for clergy prevents open dialogue on financial accountability. At St.
Mark Kangarame Church, cultural reluctance has contributed to weak christian
participation in budget discussions or financial planning and management processes.
Absence of Financial Policy Documents
There is absence of financial policies in churches and they lack written rules and
regulations that guide the receipt, use, and reporting of church funds. Internal
controls concerned with financial management lack in churches and without a
financial policy, decisions are often made based on personal judgment rather than
standardized procedures. Steward (2018), states that a documented financial policy
enhances consistency and fairness in stewardship and management. At St. Mark
Kangarame, the absence of such a document makes it hard for financial stewardship
and financial checks
Lack of External Support Due to Poor Stewardship
Some churches receive donations and grants from external agencies and because of
mismanagement of resources including money they end up losing them, However,
when accountability is weak, these partnerships are at risk of not supporting again .
Donors expect clear and accurate records, regular audits, and responsible and

18 | P a g e

effective use of funds. Chitando and Togarasei (2010), states that poor reporting led
to donor withdrawal in several African churches.
Responding to the Challenges
Responding to the challenges of financial accountability, Mugisha (2019), advocates for
the formation of stewardship and management committees comprising trusted and
trained Christians. These committees provide oversight, ensure that budgets are
followed, and promote proper accountability. Wright (2006), explains that regular
training in financial management for church leaders and accounting officers is
essential to build capacity and reduce mismanagement of funds.
Finally, developing a clear church financial policy and program is crucial in many
aspects for example Steward (2018) states that such a policy provides a standard for
managing funds, assets, and internal disputes. For St. Mark Kangarame Church,
implementing such a policy would address many of the existing gaps and foster better
financial discipline with in the church.
2.3 Measures for effective financial Stewardship of Property in St. Mark Kangarame
Church.
Management of church properties involve the careful, transparent, and faithful
management of the physical, financial, and material resources entrusted to church
leaders and Christians . In the context of St. Mark Kangarame Church, stewardship
goes beyond biblical scriptures. It requires the following administrative systems,
ethical leadership, and congregational participation to ensure sustainability and

19 | P a g e

growth. Poor stewardship in this parish, like in many rural Ugandan churches, has
resulted in issues such as unauthorized sale of church land, lack of transparency in
asset management, and neglect of property maintenance (Mugisha, 2019). Therefore,
safeguarding church
resources require different approaches that integrate
institutional, legal, educational, and spiritual and social strategies.
2.4 Measures for Improving Financial Stewardship in Church Institutions: A Case of
St. Mark Kangarame Church
Financial management in churches such as St. Mark Kangarame Church is essential
for promoting transparency, accountability, trust, and spiritual integrity One of the
important ways are to improve financial management and through the creation of
well-trained and trustworthy stewardship committees. These committees should
include both clergy and Christians with knowledge of finance and integrity in their
personal lives. Their role should involve budget planning, financial reporting, and
internal controls systems . Mugisha (2019), says involving more people in financial
oversight reduces the risk of misuse and promotes shared responsibility.
Regular Financial Training for Church Leaders and Treasurers
Many churches struggle with financial stewardship and management policies because
they lack the technical knowledge to handle budgets, reporting, and financial
planning. Churches should organize regular capacity-building workshops or partner
with Christian financial experts to train pastors, treasurers, and committee members.

20 | P a g e

Kamanzi (2020) emphasizes that when leaders are equipped with basic financial skills,
they are better positioned to align ministry goals with good financial practices.
Development and Implementation of a Church Financial Policy
A formal financial policy document should guide how funds are received, allocated,
spent, and reported. This policy must also include asset management, procurement
processes, donation handling, and conflict resolution procedures. Steward (2018)
argues that financial policies provide consistency and protection against arbitrary or
fraudulent decisions. For St. Mark Kangarame, drafting such a policy and ensuring its
consistent implementation would improve both order and trust.
Adoption of Digital Accounting and Record-Keeping Tools
Manual record-keeping is often unreliable and prone to loss or manipulation. Churches
like St. Mark Kangarame should gradually adopt digital tools, such as accounting
software, Excel spreadsheets, and mobile money tracking systems. These tools enable
accurate financial reporting, timely generation of reports, and better storage of
records. Nyabwari and Bundi (2021) note that technology helps minimize human error
and improves audit readiness.

Conducting Regular Internal and External Audits
Frequent auditing helps to evaluate whether financial practices are being followed
and whether funds are being used as intended. Internal audits by the church finance

21 | P a g e

committee can be done quarterly, while external audits by independent professionals
can be done annually. Churches that audit regularly demonstrate a commitment to
transparency and attract greater trust and support from members and donors (Wright,
2006).
Public Disclosure of Financial Reports
Transparency can be significantly improved by making financial reports accessible to
all church members. This can be done through quarterly church meetings, notice
boards, newsletters, or WhatsApp groups. Mugisha (2019) found that congregants are
more willing to give when they are well-informed on how their contributions are used.
St. Mark Kangarame should therefore commit to consistent and open financial
communication.
Encouraging Member Participation in Financial Planning
Financial stewardship should not be a top-down process. Encouraging members to
participate in budget discussions, project planning, and financial decision-making
helps build a sense of ownership and responsibility. Churches should create forums
where members can ask questions, suggest ideas, and offer feedback. Osei-Tutu et al.
(2014) affirm that participatory stewardship increases giving, unity, and collective
accountability.

22 | P a g e

Strengthening Legal Ownership and Asset Documentation
Church property and land should be properly documented and legally registered in the
name of the church, not individual leaders. This prevents illegal sales and ensures
continuity even when leadership changes. St. Mark Kangarame should collaborate with
legal experts to secure proper land titles and protect church assets.
Teaching Theological Stewardship Principles
Financial management in the church should always be guided by biblical principles.
Leaders and members need regular teaching on stewardship as a divine responsibility,
not just an administrative task. Using the new testament of the bible, the Parable of
the Talent in Mathew chapter twenty five verses fourteen then following and first
Corinthians four verse two saying that “It is required that those who have been given
a trust must prove faithful”), churches can help cultivate a spiritual motivation for
accountability and generosity (Sider, 2015).
Promoting a Culture of Financial Literacy among Members
Beyond leadership training, the entire congregation should be educated on financial
principles—how to budget, save, tithe, and give. These lessons can be incorporated
into church programs, Sunday school, youth fellowship, and couples' groups. Kamanzi
(2020) states that financially literate members are more likely to contribute regularly
and monitor church finances responsibly.

Creating Partnerships with Christian Financial Institutions
Churches can work with Christian-based banks, NGOs, or stewardship organizations
that offer support in areas such as investment, accounting systems, and fundraising.
These partnerships may provide training, tools, or even grant opportunities—especially
when stewardship systems are reliable. St. Mark Kangarame can seek such
collaborations to expand its financial capacity and knowledge base.
Establishing Clear Leadership Terms and Ethical Codes
Ethical failures often arise when leadership becomes too personalized or unregulated.
Churches should define clear leadership terms, job descriptions, and codes of ethics
for all those handling money. Violations should be met with corrective measures,
including removal from office if necessary. This ensures accountability and protects
the church’s reputation.
Introducing Budget Monitoring and Project Evaluation Mechanisms
Every project or expenditure should be monitored against its intended outcome.
Setting up a monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework enables churches to assess
the impact of their spending and this helps to promote proper accountability

24 | P a g e

Inclusion of Youth and Women in Financial Committees
Youth and women engagement in financial accountability of different churches
because they participate in large numbers in different church activities
Prayer and Spiritual Discernment in Financial Decisions
Financial stewardship remains a spiritual process and Major financial decisions are
guided by prayer and seek for right discernment from God . Church leaders should
seek God’s wisdom, not just financial logic, in every plan and expenditure. This
ensures that financial practices are in line with the church’s spiritual mission and
evangelism.
Establishment of Clear Policies and Guidelines
There should be development and enforcement of written policies on the use,
acquisition, and disposal of church property and these policies should define the roles
and responsibilities of church committees and leaders concerning land, buildings,
equipment, and financial assets (Wright, 2006). According to Kamanzi (2020), having
clear policies in place helps reduce misuse, encourages transparency, and provides a
framework for accountability
Such policies should also outline procedures for inventory management and reporting.
Churches often suffer property losses due to poor record-keeping (Sider, 2015).
Therefore, St. Mark Kangarame Church should keep updated registers of its land

25 | P a g e

titles, movable assets, and construction projects. These records can be used to
prevent theft, disputes, or encroachments.
Legal Protection of Church Assets
Many churches in Uganda lose their property due to the absence of legal ownership
documents or because they are held in the name of individuals rather than the
institution (Mugisha, 2019). Securing legal documents such as land titles in the
church’s registered name is essential for protecting assets from illegal sales or
transfers. According to Chitando and Togarasei (2010), formal registration and proper
documentation safeguard property during leadership transitions and protect the
church from legal disputes.
St. Mark Kangarame Church should work with legal experts and diocesan authorities to
ensure that all land is properly titled and that any agreements (such as leases or
donations) are legally binding and archived. Engaging local government offices or
NGOs that support land rights can also enhance property protection.

Training Church Leaders in Property Management and Accountability
Church leaders are often chosen based on their spiritual qualifications, but managing
property requires administrative and financial skills as well. Training programs for
pastors, treasurers, and committee members on financial literacy, property

26 | P a g e

management, and asset maintenance can greatly improve stewardship outcomes
(Steward, 2018).
Kamanzi (2020) emphasizes that churches in rural Uganda benefit when leaders
understand budgeting, procurement, reporting, and legal compliance. For example,
leaders should be trained on how to read and interpret land title documents, keep
maintenance schedules for church buildings, and prepare annual financial reports.
This professional development ensures that leaders make informed decisions and
avoid costly mistakes.
Regular Auditing and Monitoring
Auditing is another essential measure for improving stewardship. Internal and external
audits ensure that church resources are used properly and that procedures are
followed. According to Barna (2007), audits enhance accountability, reduce
corruption, and improve donor confidence. At St. Mark Kangarame Church, regular
audits both financial and properties and this can expose mismanagement, highlight
areas of improvement, and encourage a culture of transparency in all aspects.
These include checking physical infrastructure, confirming possession of land, and
reviewing rental agreements or contracts involving church property. A trained audit
team or external consultant can be appointed to work with the parish leadership to
perform these tasks periodically.


27 | P a g e

Creation of a Stewardship Committee
Creating a dedicated stewardship or property management committee can improve
oversight and transparency. This team, composed of trusted and skilled church
members, would be responsible for overseeing the use, maintenance, and protection
of church assets. The committee should operate under clear terms of reference and
report regularly to the congregation and diocesan authorities (Mugisha, 2019).
Such a team can evaluate potential risks, propose property improvements, review
land disputes, and guide the budgeting for repairs or new construction. When
different perspectives are represented—such as youth, women, and professionals—the
decisions of the committee are more inclusive and likely to be accepted by the wider
church body.
Use of Technology and Record-Keeping Tools
Technological tools, though underutilized in rural parishes, can significantly enhance
stewardship. Churches can use basic software such as Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets,
or specialized church accounting tools to track income, expenses, donations, and
assets. According to Steward (2018), digital systems increase transparency and make
it easier to generate reports, prepare budgets, and monitor cash flows.
For physical property, churches can use mapping tools and photo documentation to
create visual records of land and buildings. This data is helpful in legal disputes,
property transfers, or insurance claims. At St. Mark Kangarame, a simple database of

28 | P a g e

assets maintained by the stewardship committee would serve as a vital resource in
decision-making and annual reporting.
Promoting Transparency through Regular Communication
Another key strategy is improving communication between church leadership and
members. According to Wright (2006), lack of information fosters suspicion, while
regular updates increase trust and encourage participation. Leaders at St. Mark
Kangarame should present quarterly or bi-annual financial and property reports during
church meetings.
These reports should include income from church-owned land, rental properties, or
donations for building projects, along with details of expenditures. When members
are informed and involved, they feel ownership of the church’s mission and are more
likely to give generously and guard against misuse.
Cultivating a Culture of Integrity and Ethical Leadership
No amount of policy or technology can replace moral integrity. Stewardship is not only
administrative but spiritual. Leaders must demonstrate honesty, humility, and
accountability in handling resources entrusted to them (Sider, 2015). According to
Barna (2007), ethical leadership sets the tone for the entire congregation.
This culture of integrity should be reinforced through preaching, training, and
mentoring. Role models within the church—elders, pastors, and treasurers—must
exemplify faithfulness in both public and private management of church resources. In

29 | P a g e

doing so, they inspire others to follow suit and raise the moral standard of
stewardship within the church.
Encouraging Congregational Participation and Oversight
Engaging the whole church in stewardship decisions increases transparency and
accountability. Members should have a voice in major decisions regarding property
use, sales, or new construction projects (Chitando & Togarasei, 2010). Participatory
governance creates a sense of shared responsibility.
Involving lay professionals such as teachers, lawyers, engineers, and accountants can
provide technical insights during planning. Their contribution adds value and enhances
the church's management capacity. Churches should also encourage members to
volunteer in maintenance, fundraising, and monitoring projects.
Establishing Long-Term Strategic Planning
Finally, sustainable stewardship requires vision. Church leaders should develop
strategic plans that outline goals for resource development, infrastructure expansion,
and community service projects over five to ten years (Kamanzi, 2020). These plans
help churches like St. Mark Kangarame move from reactive decisions to proactive
development.
Strategic planning also involves budgeting for maintenance, risk management,
insurance, and training. A clear plan provides a roadmap that current and future

30 | P a g e

leaders can follow, ensuring continuity and preventing leadership from starting over
after every transition.
Protecting and improving stewardship of church property in St. Mark Kangarame
Church demands more than good intentions; it requires systematic planning, legal
awareness, leadership training, and active community participation. The combination
of written policies, legal registration, regular audits, digital tools, and ethical
leadership will not only safeguard resources but also boost the credibility and spiritual
mission of the church. Through transparency, planning, and education, the church can
ensure that all its properties and assets are preserved and multiplied for future
generations and used to glorify God.
2.5 Researcher’s Opinion on Christian Stewardship
Enhanced Leadership Development
Church leaders from the reviewed literature and real-life experiences in the Church of
Uganda—especially at St. Mark Kangarame Church—the researcher strongly believes
that financial stewardship must be improved for the church to grow and succeed.
Proper management of church finances does not only help pay pastors and maintain
church buildings but also supports evangelism, youth programs, and community
service. Based on theological teachings and practical observations, the researcher
gives the following opinions:

31 | P a g e

Leadership Capacity Development Is Critical
Many church leaders in Uganda are spiritually gifted but lack knowledge of finance
and budgeting. Without proper training, they may misuse funds unknowingly or fail to
plan well for church growth. Therefore, structured workshops, diocesan training
programs, and Bible-based financial courses should be made compulsory for all church
leaders (Smith, 2019). When leaders are well-trained, the whole church benefits
through better planning and transparency.
Systems of Accountability Must Be Strengthened
Accountability means being honest and open about how money is received and used.
Churches should keep financial records, provide monthly and annual reports, and
allow members to ask questions. Internal and external audits should be done
regularly. Introducing oversight committees like finance boards or parish audit teams
will reduce the risk of corruption (Green, 2020). These systems build trust and
encourage more people to give.
Churches Should Create Income-Generating Projects
Depending only on tithes and offerings is not enough, especially in poor rural
communities. Churches can start income-generating activities such as farming,
poultry, tailoring, or running schools and clinics. These projects provide extra income
and employment for members, while also funding ministry work (Mugisha, 2021). For
example, St. Mark Kangarame Church could set up a maize farm to help fund its
mission and reduce financial stress.

32 | P a g e

Members Must Be Involved in Financial Decisions
Many church members are willing to give but hesitate because they are not sure how
their money is used. When congregants are involved in budget meetings, giving
decisions, and project planning, they feel a sense of ownership. This improves giving
and accountability. Leaders should educate members on biblical giving and financial
planning to build trust and unity (Haddon, 2022).
Modern Technology Should Be Embraced
The digital age offers easy ways to improve church finance. Mobile money platforms
like MTN Mobile Money or Airtel Pay can help collect tithes. Excel or church
accounting software can be used to track income and expenses. When finances are
managed digitally, errors and misuse become less likely, and financial reports are
easier to prepare and share (Kagwa, 2022). St. Mark Kangarame Church should explore
using such technologies for better management.
2.6 Major Critique on the Research Topic
Over-Reliance on Tithes and Offerings
Many churches Although many books and Bible verses support financial stewardship,
churches in Uganda still face major problems when it comes to applying these
teachings. The researcher has identified several weaknesses that continue to limit
church growth due to poor stewardship.

33 | P a g e

Over-Reliance on Tithes and Offerings
Most churches in Uganda—including St. Mark Kangarame—depend only on Sunday
offerings and tithes. This becomes a problem during tough times like droughts,
pandemics, or economic crises, when members cannot give as expected. Without
other income sources, church operations suffer (Haddon, 2022). The lack of innovation
in fundraising and income diversification makes the church financially weak and
vulnerable.

Lack of Strong Financial Policies
Many churches do not have clear financial policies or manuals that guide income
collection, budgeting, and spending. This creates confusion and opens doors for
misuse of church funds. Even where such policies exist, they are often not followed or
reviewed regularly. In some cases, only a few individuals handle all the money without
proper checks, increasing the risk of mismanagement (Kagwa, 2022).
Limited Financial Training for Leaders
Many clergy and lay leaders do not have formal training in finance, accounting, or
resource planning. They may not know how to create a proper budget, monitor
expenses, or plan for church development. This lack of skill affects stewardship and
causes waste or misuse of resources (Smith, 2019). For churches to grow, financial
literacy should be treated as important as theological education.

34 | P a g e

Cultural and Economic Challenges
In some Ugandan cultures, giving money to the church is seen as a private or optional
matter. Others believe that only wealthy people should support the church financially.
Combined with poverty, unemployment, and high inflation, these attitudes reduce
giving among church members. Many people in rural areas live hand-to-mouth and
cannot afford regular tithing (Wilberforce, 2015). These socioeconomic issues must be
considered when designing stewardship strategies.
Resistance to financial reform, There is resistance to financial reform, Some church
leaders and elders resist change. They are used to traditional methods like verbal
reports or handwritten budgets and are unwilling to adopt digital systems, structured
policies, or open discussions on finances. Others fear losing control or being
questioned by members. This resistance slows down progress and keeps churches
operating in outdated and risky ways (Mugisha, 2021).
2.7 Chapter Summary
This chapter In this chapter, we have looked at how the church uses money and how it
helps in growing the church and doing God’s work. This is called financial
stewardship. Stewardship means taking care of something well. In the church, it
means using money and other things properly to help the church grow and help
people.
We saw that the Bible teaches us to be good stewards. For example, the Bible says in
Psalm 24:1 that everything in the world belongs to God. So, we must use it well. In

35 | P a g e

Matthew 25:14-30, Jesus tells a story that shows how important it is to take care of
what we are given. If we do well, we are blessed. If we are careless, we lose.
We also learned that church leaders must have good qualities. They must be honest,
faithful, and know how to manage money. They must also be open and give reports so
that people can trust them. Some early church leaders like Clement, Origen, and
Cranmer also taught about using church money wisely.
But in Uganda, many churches have problems with money. Some churches depend only
on offerings and tithes. Some leaders don’t know how to manage money well. Others
don’t want to use new ways like computers or mobile money. This brings problems
and stops the church from growing.
To solve these problems, the church must train leaders, create other ways to get
money, keep good records, and involve members in decisions. Using technology like
mobile money and computers can also help.
In short, when the church manages money well, it grows, and ministry becomes
strong. But when money is not handled well, it can bring problems. So, good financial
stewardship is very important for church ministry and for helping people.
