This study investigated the effect of local revenue collection on service delivery in local
government, focusing on Tororo Municipal Council in Uganda. The research specifically
examined how three key components of revenue management—revenue mobilization, revenue
assessment, and revenue enforcement affect the quality and sustainability of public services such
as infrastructure, healthcare, education, and sanitation. Employing a cross-sectional research
design, the study integrated both quantitative and qualitative methods to collect data from
municipal employees and local government officials, achieving an overall response rate of
88.2%. Statistical analyses revealed that all three revenue management components have
statistically significant positive effects on service delivery. Revenue mobilization showed a
strong influence (β = 0.568, p < 0.001), explaining 30.8% of the variation in service delivery
outcomes. Efficient revenue mobilization mechanisms enhance the council’s financial capacity,
thereby improving the provision of essential services. Revenue assessment also positively
impacted service delivery (β = 0.463, p < 0.001), accounting for 41.5% of the variation.
Accurate, transparent, and regularly updated assessment practices ensure fair tax distribution,
boosting revenue bases necessary for sustainable service financing. Revenue enforcement
exhibited the strongest effect (β = 0.771, p < 0.001), explaining 62.3% of the variation. Strict
enforcement policies such as audits, penalties, and compliance monitoring are critical for
maximizing revenue collection and consequently improving public service quality. The study
highlights challenges such as political interference, limited technological adoption, and informal
sector predominance, which affect revenue collection effectiveness in the municipal context.
Recommendations include adopting innovative tax collection methods, modernizing revenue
assessment systems, and strengthening enforcement frameworks through digital platforms and
transparency initiatives. Finally, the study calls for further research into the role of digital
technology integration and socio-political factors influencing revenue collection and service
delivery in Ugandan local governments. The findings contribute valuable empirical evidence to
inform policy reforms aimed at enhancing local government financing and public service
delivery.
