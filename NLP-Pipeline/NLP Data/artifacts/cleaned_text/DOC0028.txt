ABSTRACT
The law of insurance is based on the principle of utmost good faith which requires the
contracting party to make full and true disclosure of any material facts and also ensure that the
representations made are true. In this research, I also compare the duty of utmost good faith in
Uganda and its application in other jurisdictions to identify gaps (if any) in the insurance laws
of Uganda and propose amendments.
On the other side, a Warranty means a promissory Warranty namely a Warranty by which the
insured undertakes that some particular thing shall or shall not be done, or that some condition
shall be fulfilled, or by which he or she affirms or negatives the existence of a particular state
of facts as per Section 33(1) of the Marine Insurance Act 2002. Where the Warranty is not
complied with, the Insurer is automatically discharged from liability as per Section 33(3) of the
Marine Insurance Act 2002. Thus, this research analyses the law relating to Warranties in
Uganda, compares it with other jurisdictions, and proposes the need for reforms.

CHAPTER 1
The law of insurance revolves around the duty of utmost good faith thus the Latin expression
uberrimaefidei1 which requires the contracting party to make full and true disclosure of any
material facts which could guide a prudent insurer in determining whether to assume or take
the risk and, if so at what premium and on what condition2.
On the other side, a Warranty means a promissory Warranty namely a Warranty by which the
insured undertakes that some particular thing shall or shall not be done, or that some condition
shall be fulfilled, or by which he or she affirms or negatives the existence of a particular state
of facts as per Section 33(1)3. Section 33(3)4 stipulates that where a Warranty is not complied
with, the insurer is discharged from liability as from the date of the breach of the Warranty and
without prejudice to any liability incurred by the insurer before the date.
Thus, this research analyses the principle of utmost good faith and Warranties; the applicability
in Uganda, compares the provisions in Uganda with other jurisdictions, identifies the areas for
enhancement, and proposes actionable statutory reforms that promote fairness and
transparency in insurance transactions.
Chapter 1 will seek to examine the duty of utmost good faith and Warranties, Chapter 2 will
cover Uganda’s application of the principle of utmost good faith, Warranties, and examination
of how the principles have been applied, Chapter 3 will cover the application of utmost good
faith and Warranties in other jurisdictions, Chapter 4 will cover proposals for reforms, a
summary of findings, Recommendations, and conclusion.
Background of the study
The Insurance contracts are largely based on the principle of utmost good faith that must be
observed by both the insured and the insurer5. Good faith means a state of mind consisting of
honesty in belief or purpose, faithfulness to one’s duty or obligation, and observance of
reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing in a given trade or business6. Insurance
contracts are contracts of Uberrimae fidei which means a contract in which the parties owe

6 Black’s Law Dictionary by Bryan A. Garner 8th Edition page 2038


each other duties with utmost good faith7. Section 178 provides that a contract of marine
insurance is based upon the utmost good faith and if this duty is not observed by either party,
the contract may be avoided by the other party. Thus, the principle of utmost good faith reflects
the openness and fair dealing required of the parties in the various stages of their relationship9.
Historically, the leading case on utmost good faith in insurance is Carter v Boehm10, Lord
Mansfield stated that; “Insurance is a contract upon speculation. The special facts, upon which
the contingent chance is to be computed, lie most commonly in the knowledge of the insured
only: the under-writer trusts to his representation, and proceeds upon the confidence that he
does not keep back any circumstance in his knowledge, to mislead the underwriter into a belief
that the circumstance does not exist, and to induce him to estimate the risk as if it did not exist”
and further held that the rationale for adopting the duty of utmost good faith is that when the
insured conceals material facts, the insurer agrees to insure on the false estimate of the risk.
Thus, in the 19th Century, the cases referred to the duty of utmost good faith to express the precontractual duty of disclosure and the duty not to misrepresent material facts as per Brownlie
V Campbell11.
Initially the law that provided for the principle of utmost good faith in the UK was the Marine
Insurance Act 1906. Section 1712 provided that a contract of insurance is based upon the
principle of utmost good faith, and, if the principle of utmost good faith is not observed, the
contract may be avoided by the other party. The agent’s duty of disclosure provided under
Section 1913, the duty of the insured not to make any misrepresentations and if he or she does,
the insurer may avoid the contract as referred to under Section 2014, the duty on the insured to
disclose all material facts as referred to under Section 1815.
It must be noted that all the above provisions on Utmost good faith are also reflected in the
Marine Insurance Act 2002 Laws of Uganda. Section 1716 provides that a contract of marine
insurance is based upon the utmost good faith and if not observed, the contract may be avoided

by the other party. Section 1917 stipulates that where a contract is effected for the insured by an
agent or broker, then the agent or broker must disclose every material fact that is known to
himself or herself and is deemed to know every circumstance which in the ordinary course of
business ought to be known by, or to have been communicated to him or her and every material
circumstances which the insured is bound to disclose unless it comes to his or her knowledge
too late to communicate it to the agent or broker.
Section 1818 provides that the assured must disclose to the insurer every material circumstance
which is known to the assured and if the insured fails to make that disclosure before the contract
is concluded, the insurer may avoid the contract. And Section 2019 provides for the duty of the
insured not to make any misrepresentations and that if they do, the insurer may avoid the
contract.
The above different sections have been applied by courts for example in Hajji Kavuma Haroon
V First Insurance Company Ltd20 court noted that the non-disclosure and misrepresentation
alleged and proved by the defendant went to the root of the contract and thus the insured was
in breach of the principle of utmost good faith thus the insurer was entitled to avoid the contract
due to the dishonesty of the plaintiff.
In Uganda, there have been incidents where the duty of utmost good faith has been considered
to be unfair regarding its applicability in the insurance industry in Uganda, and as a result, there
have been proposals for reform in this area of insurance law. For example Justice Stephen
Musota National Insurance Corporation V Sylvan Kakugu21 stated that the duty is unfair
because; the insured can be unaware of their duty to disclose information, the only remedy for
breach of utmost good faith is avoiding the entire contract, and the insurer is not required to
show that the none disclosure or misrepresentation had any causal link to the claim to avoid
the contract and also the insured is required to provide material information that would
influence the judgment of a prudent insurer, this favours insurers to escape liability for a loss
by reference to the standard of underwriting diligence and prudence of the prudent insurer even
though the non-disclosed facts might not affect their willingness to write the risk22.

As earlier noted, the United Kingdom in 1906 and Uganda had the same provisions on the duty
of utmost good faith however the United Kingdom Insurance Act 2015 introduces new aspects
to the principle the Act introduces the following changes/requirements to the duty it states that;
an insured ought to make a fair presentation and this means that one that discloses in a manner
which would be reasonably clear and accessible to a prudent insurer and every material
representation as to matter of fact is substantially23, different remedies as provided for in the
schedule to the Act for example if the insurer would have entered into the contract whether the
terms relating to matters other than the premium would have been the same or different, but
would have charged a higher premium, the insurer may reduce proportionately the amount to
be paid on a claim. and also examples of what may be considered a material circumstance for
instance special or unusual facts relating to the risk, any particular concerns which led the
insured to seek insurance cover for the risk, anything which those concerned with the class of
insurance and field of activity in question would generally understand as being something that
should be dealt with in a fair presentation of risks of the type in question24. However, Uganda
has not had any amendment in the Marine Insurance Act 2002 on the principle of utmost good
faith.
On the other hand, Section 33(1)25 provides that a Warranty means a promissory Warranty
namely a Warranty by which the insured undertakes that some particular thing shall or shall not
be done, or that some condition shall be fulfilled, or by which he or she affirms or negatives
the existence of a particular state of facts. Section 33(3)26 provides that a Warranty is a
condition that must be complied with, whether it is material to the risk or not, and if it is not
complied with, then subject to any express provision in the policy, the insurer is discharged
from liability as from the date of the breach of the Warranty and without prejudice to any
liability incurred y the insurer before the date.
Also, the UK Marine Insurance Act 1906, Section 33(3) of the Marine Insurance Act 1906
provided that upon breach of a Warranty, the insurer was discharged from all liability as from
the date of the breach. However, the UK Insurance Act 2015 under Section 10(1)27 abolishes
the rule of automatic discharge

Thus, the importance of this research is to point out the need to reform these areas of law in
line with some of the challenges currently faced with its implementation, it will compare the
duty of utmost good faith and Warranties in other jurisdictions to identify gaps if any and also
assess on the need for an amendment of the current Marine Insurance Act 2002 and insurance
laws to promote fairness and transparency in insurance transactions.
Statement of the problem
The principle of utmost good faith is important in the insurance industry and is provided for
under Sections 17,18,19,20 and 21 of the Marine Insurance Act 2002. However, Justice Stephen
Musota28 noted that the duty as provided for in our laws is unfair because; the insured can be
unaware of their duty to disclose information, the only remedy for breach of utmost good faith
is avoiding the entire contract, and the insurer is not required to show that the none disclosure
or misrepresentation had any causal link to the claim to avoid the contract and also the insured
is required to provide material information that would influence the judgement of a prudent
insurer, which is unfair for an ordinary insured.
It was also noted that one of the reasons why some people were not insured is because some of
the insurance companies do not pay insurance claims as they are presented, and also the breach
of the duty of utmost good faith leads to the avoidance of the contract by the insurer.29 it was
also observed that some of the insurers change service providers without informing their clients
in regards to their medical insurance and this is also a problem for the insurance industry since
this will discourage other people from opting for insurance that will cover their expenses in
case of any uncertain risk.30, thus, there are unfair aspects of the duty of utmost good faith in
the Ugandan Insurance laws and also challenges faced in promoting this principle both to the
insured and insurer in insurance contracts, if these challenges are not addressed with immediate
effect for instance loopholes in the existing law, ignorance of the law then it may lead to some
people not taking insurance.
Section 33(3) of the UK Marine Insurance Act 1906 provided that upon breach of a Warranty,
the insurer was discharged from all liability as from the date of the breach. However, the UK

Insurance Act 2015 under Section 10(1)31 abolishes the rule of automatic discharge. Thus, a
need to assess current laws on insurance in Uganda.
Objectives of the study
1. To analyze the principle of utmost good faith; the law relating to Warranties and the
applicability of both in Ugandan insurance law.
2. To analyze and compare the law governing the principle of utmost good faith and
Warranties in other jurisdictions
3. To find out the proposals for reforms in promoting fairness and transparency in
insurance industry.
4. To find out the recommendations for the gaps identified in the existing legal framework
Research Questions
1. What is the principle of utmost good faith and Warranties in the Insurance Industry in
Uganda?
2. What is the law governing the principle of utmost good faith and Warranties in other
jurisdictions?
3. What are the proposals for reforms in promoting fairness and transparency in insurance
industry?
4. What are the recommendations for the gaps identified in the existing legal framework?
Justification of the study
The duty of utmost good faith and the law relating to Warranties are important in the insurance
industry and as noted the provisions on the principle of utmost good faith and the law relating
to Warranties are replica of the 1906 UK Marine Insurance Act. However, with the UK
Insurance Act 2015, the UK has since changed the provisions on the principle of utmost good
faith and the law relating to Warranties. Uganda still has the old provisions as stipulated in the
1906 Marine Insurance Act and thus the justification for this research to push for amendments
of the current laws on the principle of utmost good faith in insurance law.
Significance of the study
The research on Warranties and utmost good faith in the insurance industry benefits both the
prospective insureds, the insurers and make the public aware of this principle, applicability and

31 UK Insurance Act 2015


the consequences upon breach. This study also provides several recommendations for the
challenges and gaps identified.
Scope of the study
The scope of the study was limited to the insurance industry in Uganda. It examined the
significance of the principle of utmost good faith and the law relating to Warranties. The study
made jurisdictional comparisons and thus made recommendations necessary for statutory
reforms to streamline the Insurance industry in Uganda.
The study focussed on Kampala and Metropolitan Areas since most insurance companies and
the IRA are situated in Kampala.
LITERATURE REVIEW
A circumstance is material if it would influence the judgment of a prudent insurer in fixing the
premium, or determining whether he or she would take the risk.32 This is a difficult situation
for the insured as Malcolm Clarkes33 stated that the duty of utmost good faith is tested based
on the judgment of a ‘prudent insurer’ thus the proposer is required to think in a way an insurer
in the market does, which is unfair to the insured34 Furthermore, in National Insurance
Corporation V Sylvan Kakugu court noted that the test of materiality assesses the insured by
reference to the professional knowledge of the insurer which is unfair, and thus proposed the
need for the amendment of the Insurance Law in regards to the principle of utmost good faith
in Uganda.
Further, on the point that every piece of information will be considered material if it would
influence the judgment of the prudent insurer at the time of contract or renewal. Hasson R35
proposed that an insurer’s failure to ask questions at the time of taking out the policy about
losses ought to be regarded as a waiver of this information, as should the insurer’s acceptance
of blank replies to questions in the proposal form regardless of the form of the question and on
the other side Merkin R36 proposed that the test that ought to be used is that of a reasonable
insured, thus in this research, we will look at which position should Uganda adopt.

36 Merkin, R, ‘Uberrima fides strikes again’ (1976) 39 MLR 478


Hasson, R.37 also states that an insurer should not be allowed to take advantage of ambiguous
questions in the proposal form. In Uganda, one of the unfair aspects of the principle of Utmost
good faith is that the insured can still be in breach even if the error was reasonable in
circumstances for example if a question was unclear or required specific technical knowledge
that they did not have.38 Thus, a need for an amendment of the insurance laws in Uganda which
is the main purpose of this research.
The Insurance Institute of Uganda39 stated that the insured knows or ought to know all about
the risk being proposed for insurance as the insurer relies largely on information disclosed by
the insured/assured thus most of the facts relating to health, habits, personal history, family
history, etc., which form the basis of the Life Insurance contract, are known only to the insured.
However, Hasson, R40 stated that the doctrine of Utmost good faith assumes that the insured is
in a stronger position than the insurer because the insured has more knowledge than the insurer,
however submitted that this puts the insured at a disadvantage since the insured does not know
which parts of that information the insurer wishes to have. Thus proposes some reforms that
statute should state in the clearest possible language that any failure by an insurer to ask of an
insured information customarily sought by insurers in the type of policy in question should be
deemed a waiver of such information. Thus, this research will critically assess the principle of
good faith and the applicability of the reforms proposed.
The Law Commission41 stated that some of the reforms that should be adopted are that the
insured should not be under an obligation to disclose some information for example classified
information could include an applicant’s race or nationality; further, the insured should be
deemed to be under no obligation to reveal that he has previously been refused thus proposed
that about the disclosure of the insured should be penalized only if he acted in bad faith that is
if he knew, or had very good cause to believe that a particular piece of information would be
material to the insurer and that the burden of showing bad faith should again be placed on the
insurer.

Justice Stephen Musota in National Insurance Corporation V Sylvan Kakugu 42 noted that the
insured may be unaware of their duty to volunteer information not specifically asked for by the
insured on the proposal form and thus stated that good faith duties are more onerous for the
insured than that the insurer and may require a review of the Ugandan Insurance law to do
away with the unfair aspects. Further, the Law Commission43 pointed out that many laymen
are not aware that a duty of disclosure exists and that it may be very difficult for those who are
aware of the duty to know what information would be regarded as material by a prudent insurer
and since specific questions are not asked in proposal forms, it is hard for the insurer to tell and
may also have the effect of creating a trap for the insured under the present law since some of
them do not know about the disclosure and what is to be disclosed thus proposed that this is
mischief which requires reform for the protection of the insured and that no general questions
in addition to specific questions should be permitted, such as a question whether there were
any other facts which might influence the judgment of a prudent insurer in accepting the risk
and fixing the premium ought to be avoided.
The other unfair aspect of the duty of utmost good faith in insurance law is that the only remedy
for breach of good faith duties is retrospective avoidance of the entire contract.44. Justice
Stephen Musota 45 noted that this is also unfair to the insured thus proposing the need for
reform.
The Insured is not required to show that non disclosure or misrepresentation had any causal
link to the claim to avoid the contract as per the case of Justice Stephen Musota 46 where he
noted that this is unfair to the insured that proposed the need for amendments in the current
Insurance law of Uganda. The Law Commission provisionally recommended that the law of
warranties should be reformed so that there ought to be a rejection of a claim for breach only
if there is no connection of some kind between the insured’s breach and the loss. Thus, it
proposed that the further protection that the insured needs should be provided by legislation as
per the words of Lawton LJ47 who stated that such injustices as there are must now be dealt

with by Parliament if they are to be got rid of at all. Thus, the emphasis on the statutory reforms
as it is the same position in Uganda.
Andre Farrugia48 stated that there is an obligation on the insurer to inform the insured about
the exclusions, limitations, and restrictions under the insurance policy to be issued and also to
fairly assess the proposal form submitted by the prospective insured and to reveal any
information pertinent to the risk. The Law Commission Report49 pointed out that an insured
would have no legal remedy if an insurer fails to act by them. Also, in Uganda, the Marine
Insurance Act 2002 does not provide for the standard to be used in case of a breach on the side
of the insurer, thus the need for the amendment.
METHODOLOGY
The Researcher used both qualitative methods of data collection. Primary data was collected
using questionnaires and interviews and respondents were chosen based on their perceived
knowledge and credibility on the matter. Secondary data was collected through intensive
desktop and library research to enable a deeper understanding of the extent to which the laws
on the principle of utmost good faith are followed and also assess the need for reform in the
law relating to Warranties.

CHAPTER 2; THE PRINCIPLE OF UTMOST GOOD FAITH AND THE LAW RELATING
TO WARRANTIES IN UGANDA.
Uganda’s application of the principle of utmost good faith and the law relating to Warranties;
examination of how the principles have been applied in Uganda
Insurance contracts are contracts of Uberrimae fidei which means a contract in which the
parties owe each other duties with utmost good faith50.Thus, it requires the contracting party to
make full and true disclosure of any material facts that could guide a prudent insurer in
determining whether to assume or take the risk and, if so at what premium and on what
condition51. In Carter v Boehm52 the court held that the rationale for adopting the duty of
utmost good faith is that when the insured conceals material facts, the insurer agrees to insure
on the false estimate of the risk.
The law that governs the duty of utmost good faith in Uganda is the Marine Insurance Act
2002.The Court in National Insurance Corporation V Sylvan Kakugu53 noted that the duty of
good faith provided for in the Marine Insurance Act 2002 under Sections 17,18,19 and 20
applies to all sectors of insurance and not just marine insurance. In Uganda, the law governing
Warranties in insurance is part VIII of the Marine Insurance Act 2002.
Utmost good faith in the insurance industry
Section 1754 provides that a contract of marine insurance is based upon the utmost good faith,
and if the utmost good faith is not observed by either party, the contract may be avoided. The
court in National Insurance Corporation Ltd V Kakugu Sylvan55 noted that the general duty of
utmost good faith manifests itself in at least two important respects and that is; a duty to
disclose material facts and a duty not to misrepresent material facts
The duty to disclose by the assured is provided for under Section 18 of the Marine Insurance
Act, 200256. Section 18(1)57 provides that;

“ the assured must disclose to the insurer before the contract is concluded, every material
substance which is known to the assured, and the assured is deemed to know in every
circumstance which, in the ordinary course of business, ought to be known by him or her,
and if the assured fails to make that disclosure, the insurer may avoid the contract”58.
It must be noted that the insured is not bound to disclose what he or she does not know as per
Section 18(1)59. Thus, the court in Joel V Law Union and Crown Insurance60 noted that since
the insured did not know that she was suffering from acute depression, she owed no duty to
disclose.
A duty not to make any misrepresentation is provided under Section 20(1)61 which states that;
“ every representation made by the insured or his or her agent, to the insurer during the
negotiations for a contract of marine insurance, and before the contract is concluded must
be true, and if any such representation is untrue, the insurer may avoid the contract62”.
Section 18(2)63 provides that;
“A circumstance is material if it would influence the judgment of a prudent insurer in fixing
the premium, or determining whether he or she will take the risk. And Section 20(2)64
provides that a representation is material if it would influence the judgment of a prudent
insurer in fixing premiums or determining whether he or she will take the risk65”.
In Container Transport International Inc v Oceanus Mutual Underwriting Association66 noted
that the standard test of materiality should be determined by reference to what a reasonable
insurer would expect to be material and thus held that the plaintiff had made representations
that were both material and untrue and the defendant was free to avoid liability. In Pan Atlantic
Insurance Co. Ltd V Pine Top Insurance Co. Ltd67, the court held that regarding disclosure and
misrepresentation, the relevant test was whether the information not disclosed or
misrepresented would have influenced the mind of a prudent insurer in assessing the risk and

that information would therefore be material if it would affect the premium charged or any
other terms.
Furthermore, the court in National Insurance Corporation Ltd V Kakugu Sylvan68 observed
that the test of materiality which underlies the rules of disclosure and misrepresentation
assesses the insured by reference to the professional knowledge of the insurer and thus relying
on Pan Atlantic Insurance Co. Ltd V Pine Top Insurance Co. Ltd69 held that no non-disclosure
or misrepresentation would have influenced the insurer's judgment.
Thus, the non-disclosed fact must have also induced the actual insurer to enter into the contract
as per Berger Light Diffusers Pty Ltd v Pollock70 furthermore, the court in Babatsikos V Car
Owner’s Mutual Insurance Co.71 noted that because the test of materiality depends initially on
the opinion of a reasonable insurer, the courts are prepared to accept the opinion of other
insurers as evidence of whether or not particular facts are material.
Different courts in Uganda have discussed and applied the principle of utmost good faith in
Uganda, For example, Justice Christopher Madrama discussed the principle of utmost good
faith in Longway Suitcase Manufacturing Co. Ltd V UAP Insurance (U) Ltd72 and stated that
the principle includes a duty of a promise to communicate to the promisor every fact and
circumstance that may influence him in deciding to enter the contract or not and stated that the
duty of utmost good faith survives the making of a contract, thus where the assured makes a
fraudulent claim (this includes where a claimant suffered no loss, claim is supported by false
evidence and where there are deliberately exaggerated figures in the claim), then it is in breach
of the principle of utmost good faith.
In Hajji Kavuma Haroon V First Insurance Company Ltd73 court observed that the nondisclosure of adjustments of vehicles insured greatly changed several things such as the
valuation done thus, noted that the non-disclosure and misrepresentation alleged and proved
by the defendant go to the root of the contract as they were in breach of utmost good faith, thus
held that the breach of this duty renders the contract voidable and that there was no breach of

contract done by the defendant as it exercised its right to terminate the contract because of the
dishonesty of the plaintiff.
However, it must be noted that there are circumstances that need not be disclosed for example
any circumstance; that diminishes the risk, known or is presumed to be known to the insurer,
and the insurer is deemed to know matters of common notoriety or knowledge and matters
which an insurer in the ordinary course of his or her business as such ought to know and any
circumstance to which information is waived by the insurer as per Section 18(3)74
Section 19(1)75 provides that where the contract is affected for the assured by an agent or a
broker, the agent or broker must disclose to the insurer; every material circumstance which is
known to himself or herself, and an agent or broker to insure is deemed to know every
circumstance which is in the ordinary course of business ought to be known by, or to have been
communicated to, him or her and every circumstance which the assured is bound to disclose,
unless it comes to his or her knowledge too late to communicate it to the agent or broker.
In Motor Union Insurance Company Ltd V AK Ddamba76 the court held that the agent of the
insurers was acting as an amanuensis of the proposer in the completion of the form and that his
knowledge could not be imputed to the insurers.
Warranties in the insurance industry
Warranties on the other hand are promises made by the insured and must be a term of the
policy77 In other words, they are promises made by insureds relating to facts or to things that
they undertake to do or not to do, as the case may be78.
They include warranties as to present or past facts as at the date they are made which often
arise as a result of a completed proposal form that was declared to be the basis of the contract79;
Warranties as to the future which are also known as continuing or promissory Warranties which
mean continuing promises by the insured that facts will or will not exist in the future or will or
will not continue to exist for the future80 and Warranties of opinion where the insured warrants

that facts are or will be true to the best of their knowledge and belief, there will be a breach of
warranty only if they dishonestly or recklessly supply an incorrect answer81.
In Uganda, the law governing Warranties in insurance is part VIII of the Marine Insurance Act
2002. Section 33(1)82 provides that;
“A Warranty means a promissory warranty namely a warranty by which the insured
undertakes that some particular thing shall or shall not be done, or that some condition shall
be fulfilled, or by which he or she affirms or negatives the existence of a particular state of
facts83”.
Section 33(3)84 of the Marine Insurance Act 2002 provides that;
“ A Warranty is a condition that must be complied with, whether it is material to the risk or
not, and if it is not complied with, then subject to any express provision in the policy, the
insurer is discharged from liability as from the date of the breach of the warranty and
without prejudice to any liability incurred y the insurer before the date85”.
Initially the UK Marine Insurance Act 1906, under Section 33(3) provided that upon breach of
a warranty, the insurer was discharged from all liability as from the date of the breach. Thus,
in De Hahn v Hartley86 was held that the insurer could avoid all liability for breach of warranty,
even though it was obvious that the breach had no connection with the loss that subsequently
occurred when the ship was lost in the Atlantic Ocean. The House of Lords in Bank of Nova
Scotia v Hellenic Mutual War Risks Association87the court stated that the breach of warranty
would put the risk to an end automatically from the time of the breach and that the club was
therefore in breach of its obligation to notify the bank.
However, there was an amendment to the law relating to Warranties in the UK thus, Section
10(1)88of the UK Insurance Act, 2015 abolishes the rule of automatic discharge Section.10(2)89
provides that;

89 UK Insurance Act 2015


“An insurer has no liability in respect of any loss occurring, or attributable to something
happening, after a warranty has been breached but before the breach has been remedied90”.
However, under s.10(3) of the UK Insurance Act 2015, the insurer will not be discharged from
liability if because of a change of circumstances, the warranty ceases to apply to the
circumstances of the contract, compliance with the warranty is rendered unlawful by any
subsequent law, or if the insurer waives the breach of warranty.
In addition, under s.10(4)91, the insurer will be liable in respect of losses occurring, or
attributable to something happening, before the breach of warranty or, if the breach can be
remedied, after it has been remedied. A breach is regarded as remedied in two situations.
Section 10(6)92 provides that where a warranty requires something to be done or not done, or a
condition is to be fulfilled, or something is or is not to be the case and that requirement is not
complied with, but the risk to which the warranty relates later becomes essentially the same as
that originally contemplated by the parties.
Section 1193 provides that if a loss occurs, and the term has not been complied with, the insurer
may not rely on the non-compliance to exclude, limit, or discharge its liability under the
contract for the loss. thus, if the non-compliance with the term could not have increased the
risk of the loss that occurred in the circumstances in which it occurred then the insured satisfies
this provision
In Uganda, if a Warranty is not complied with, then subject to any express provision in the
policy, the insurer is discharged from liability as from the date of the breach of the warranty
and without prejudice to any liability incurred on the insurer before the date as per Section
33(3)94
It must be noted that if the insurance contract is ambiguous, it is construed against the insurer
as was noted by the court in Provincial Insurance Co v Morgan95which observed that it is the
insurer who formulates the wording, in the event of any ambiguity, the warranty will be
construed contra proferentem hence benefitting the insured Thus, the Ugandan court in Lucy

Ltd96 relied on Re Etherington & Lancashire & Yorkshire Accident97 which stated that where
the policy is ambiguous, the court will apply the contra proferentem rule and interpret the
document against the insurer thus the commercial court of Uganda observed that the defendant
drew a policy in which they incorporated a clause on fidelity and in the policy schedule, they
mentioned libel and slander and mentioned nothing on the fidelity clause and thus stated that
such inconclusive provisions can only be dealt with as per the contra proferentem rule, hence
held that they incorporated the fidelity clause through the operative clause and that the parties
intended to operationalize the clause when need arose.
The law that governs the duty of utmost good faith in Uganda is the Marine Insurance Act 2002
and the duty includes a duty to disclose material facts and a duty not to misrepresent material
facts and Warranties where the insurer is discharged of their liability upon breach of the
Warranty as also governed by part VIII of the Marine Insurance Act 2002.

Chapter 3; WARRANTIES AND UTMOST GOOD FAITH IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS
In most countries, both the insured and the insurer must comply with the principle of utmost
good faith in insurance, thus most of the countries made laws on this principle as provided
under the Common law provisions under Sections 17, 18, 19, and 20 of the 1906 Marine
Insurance Act. These provisions are similar to what is provided under the Marine Insurance Act
2002, which is the current law in Uganda. However, it must be noted that most countries have
since changed their provisions on the principle of utmost good faith UK inclusive.
In Uganda, the law governing Warranties in insurance is part VIII of the Marine Insurance Act
2002. Section 33 of the UK Marine Insurance Act 1906 provided that upon breach of a
Warranty, the insurer was discharged from all liability as from the date of the breach. This is
similar to Uganda’s current position under Section 33(3)98 which provides that where a
Warranty is not complied with, whether it is material to the risk or not, the insurer is discharged
from liability as from the date of the breach of the Warranty and without prejudice to any
liability incurred y the insurer before the date.
One of the Respondents at IRA noted that for example where a policy requires one to have a
fire sprinkler system as a continuing warranty, and there is a loss as a result of a fire, if the
insured did not have the fire sprinkler system in place, then the insurance company will not be
held liable. In other words, the insurer is discharged from liability. Another example is the
requirement of an active alarm system for a specified property (as a Warranty in the policy), if
any theft occurs and there is no alarm system or a defective alarm system, then the insurance
company will not be held liable
However, there was an amendment to the law relating to Warranties in the UK thus, Section
10(1) UK Insurance Act 2015 abolishes the rule of automatic discharge and most countries
have changed their laws on Warranties including other countries as will be discussed in this
chapter.

98 Marine Insurance Act 2002


UTMOST GOOD FAITH IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS
United Kingdom
Initially, the law governing the principle of utmost good faith in the UK was the 1906 Marine
Insurance Act, however, this was later amended by the UK Insurance Act 2015.
Section 3(1) of the UK Insurance Act 2015 states that;
“Before a contract of insurance is entered into, the insured must make to the insurer a fair
presentation of the risk99”
This amends the duties regarding disclosure and representations that are contained in the
Marine Insurance Act 1906. Section 3(3) of the UK Insurance Act 2015 states that;
“Fair presentation of the risk makes that disclosure in a manner which would be reasonably
clear and accessible to a prudent insurer and in which every material representation as to a
matter of fact is substantially correct, and every material representation as to a matter of
expectation or belief is made in good faith100”.
Section 7(3) of the UK Insurance Act 2015 states that;
“A circumstance or representation is material if it would influence the judgment of a prudent
insurer in determining whether to take the risk and, if so, on what terms101”.
Section 7(4) of the UK Insurance Act 2015 provides examples of things that may be material
circumstances which include unusual facts relating to the risk, any particular concerns that led
the insured to seek insurance cover for the risk, anything that those concerned with the class of
insurance and field of activity in question would generally understand as being something that
should be dealt with in a fair presentation of risks of the type in question
Section 4 of the UK Insurance Act 2015 limits the knowledge of the insured regarding the
material circumstances that he or she ought to disclose; an insured who is an individual knows
only what is known to the individual and what is known to the individual who is responsible
for the insured’s insurance.
Section 4(8) of the UK Insurance Act 2015 states that;

99 UK Insurance Act 2015
100 UK Insurance Act 2015
101 UK Insurance Act 2015


“An individual is responsible for the insured’s insurance if the individual participates on
behalf of the insured in the process of procuring the insured’s insurance102”.
However, Section 4(6) of the UK Insurance Act 2015 introduces the reasonableness test and
demands that the prospective insured should know what should have been revealed by a
reasonable search of information.
Section 14 of the UK Insurance Act 2015 provides that any rule of law which provides for a
party to a contract of insurance to avoid the contract on the ground of breach of the principle
of utmost good faith by the other party is abolished.
To have a remedy for a breach of the duty of fair presentation, Section 8(1) of the UK Insurance
Act 2015 requires the insurer to demonstrate that it would have acted differently if the insured
had made a fair presentation of the risk for example that it would not have accepted the risk at
all or would have done so only on and the remedies, set out in the Schedule to the Act.
The above provision was applied by The High Court in Dalecroft Properties Ltd V
Underwriters103 where the claimant insured their property with the defendants under a property
owner policy in July 2007 and renewed it in August 2008. In May 2009, there was a fire which
led to severe damage to the property and the claimant made a claim however the defendants
denied it on the grounds of misrepresentation and non-disclosure of the description and
condition of the property at the renewal of the contract. The issue was whether the
misrepresentation and non-disclosure by Dalecroft at the time of renewal entitled the
Underwriters to avoid the policy. The court applied the 1906 Marine Insurance Act because at
the time the parties signed the policy it was the Act in place, however, the court also considered
the duty of fair representation under Section 3 of the UK Insurance Act of 2015 and noted that
Dalecroft did not make an effort at the time of the renewal of the policy to comply with the
commercial unoccupancy terms of the policy for the residential property to be in a proper state,
the court further held that the property was not in a good state of repair where it had also been
subject to acts of vandalism and also held that the Underwriters would have not entered into
the contract on any of the terms of a fair representation had been made my Dalecroft at renewal
and thus held that Dalecroft’s claim would also fail under the UK Insurance Act 2015.

102 UK Insurance Act 2015
103[2017] EWHC 1263


Section 8(3) of the UK Insurance Act 2015 provides that a qualifying breach is where the
insurer has a remedy against the insured for the breach, and a qualifying breach is deliberate or
reckless where the insured knew that it was a breach of the duty of fair representation or where
the insured did not care about whether it was a breach of that duty as per Section 8(5) of the
UK Insurance Act 2015. Schedule 1 of the UK Insurance Act 2015 provides that if the
qualifying breach was deliberate or reckless, then the insurer may avoid the policy and refuse
to pay the claims and they do not have to return the premium.
Paragraph 4 of the First Schedule UK Insurance Act 2015 states that;
“In the absence of a qualifying breach, if the insurer would not have entered into the
contract, the insurer may avoid the contract and refuse to pay all claims however must return
the premium104”.
Paragraph 5 of the First Schedule of the UK Insurance Act 2015 states that;
“Where the insurer would have entered the contract on different terms, then the contract is
to be treated as if the contract had been entered on those different terms if the insurer
requires105”.
The High Court of Justice Chancery Division applied the above provisions in the case of
Scotbeef Ltd V D& S Storage Ltd and Anor106 where the 1st defendant agreed to freeze and
store meat for the claimant, however, the six pallets of meat that were transferred to the
claimant by the 1st defendant were discovered to have mold, the claimant claimed 395,588
pounds from the defendant due to the breach of the contract in regards to the storage of meat
since it was discovered to have mold and also unfit for human consumption, the defendant
denied liability and stated that the mold was not as a result of the refrigeration services provided
by them and further stated that the contract incorporated the Food Storage & Distribution
Federations (FSDF) terms and conditions which provided that the claimant was time-barred
from bringing legal proceedings against the defendant by 3rd July 2020 and that if not timebarred the breach was limited to 250 per metric ton. The issue was whether the FSDF terms
and conditions were incorporated into the contract between the parties. In dealing with the
claim, the court considered both the duty of fair representation and Warranties and noted that
the duty of fair representation is provided for under Section 3 of the UK Insurance Act 2015

104 UK Insurance Act 2015
105 UK Insurance Act 2015
106 Scotbeef Ltd V D& S Storage Ltd and Anor [2024] EWHC 341


and that Section 8 and Schedule 1 provide for the remedies in case of any breach of the duty of
fair presentation thus observed that the failure of complying with the FSDF terms was a
qualifying breach however noted that the breach was neither deliberate nor reckless sine the
insured thought they were trading on FSDF terms thus court held that the insurers did not show
that they would not have entered into the contract with the insured on any terms, hence relied
on paragraphs 4 and 5 of Schedule 1 of the UK Insurance Act 2015 that provide for innocent
misrepresentation and held that there was a possibility for the contract to be amended to the
terms sought by the insurer.
Australia
The Marine Insurance Act of 1906 was largely adopted by Australia for its Marine Insurance
Act 1909. Several changes were introduced to the Insurance Contracts Amendment Act 2013
of (Australia) which was passed into law in 2013. Thus Sections 12 to 15 of the Insurance
Amendment Act (Australia) made significant changes in the principle of utmost good faith
under common law.
Section 13(2) of the Insurance Contracts Act (Australia) 1984 as amended states that;
“A contract of insurance is based on the principle of utmost good faith and that there is an
implied term in such a contract a provision requiring each party to it to act towards the other
party, in respect of any matter arising under or about it and the failure by a party to a contract
of insurance to comply with the provision implied in the contract then it is a breach of the
requirements of this Act107”.
Section 13(4) of the Insurance Contracts Act (Australia) 1984 as amended provides that a
reference in this section to a party to a contract of insurance includes a reference to a thirdparty beneficiary under the contract however this applies only after the contract is entered into.
Section 11 of the Insurance Contracts Act (Australia) 1984 as amended
“A third party under a contract of insurance means a person who is not a party to the contract
but is specified or referred to in the contract, whether by name or otherwise, as a person to
whom the benefit of the insurance cover provided by the contract extends108”.

107 Insurance Contracts Act (Australia) 1984 as amended
108 Insurance Contracts Act (Australia) 1984 as amended


Thus, the Insurance Contracts Amendment Act 2013 of (Australia) introduces the duty of
utmost good faith to include third-party beneficiaries of the contract and also provides for the
Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) to address breaches of the duty of
utmost good faith and enforce measures to ensure compliance with the duty as per Section 14A
of the Insurance Contracts Act (Australia) 1984 as amended.
In Australia, the insured’s duty of disclosure is provided for under Sections 21 and 22 of the
Insurance Contracts Act (Australia) 1984 as amended.
Section 21 of the Insurance Contracts Act (Australia) 1984 as amended states that;
“An insured must disclose to the insurer, before the relevant contract of insurance is entered
into, every matter that is known to the insured, being a matter that the insured knows to be
a matter relevant to the decision of the insurer whether to accept the risk and, if so, on what
terms or a reasonable person in the circumstances could be expected to know to be a matter
so relevant109”.
Section 22 of the Insurance Contracts Act (Australia) 1984 as amended stipulates that the
insurer has a duty before the contract of insurance is concluded to inform the insured in writing
of the general nature and effect of the duty of disclosure. Section 29 of The Insurance Contracts
Act (Australia) 1984 as amended introduces eligible contracts of insurance that require the
insurer to ask specific types of questions and if the insurer does not, the insurer will be taken
to have waived the disclosure requirement.
Thus, it must be noted that unlike the Marine Insurance Act 2002, the Insurance Contracts Act
(Australia) 1984 as amended imposes a duty on the insurer to inform the insured in writing
before the contract is concluded about the principle of utmost good faith as per Section 21A of
the Insurance Contracts Act (Australia) 1984 as amended, to also notify the insured of the
unusual terms for policies that are not eligible contracts and if they do not do so, they cannot
rely on any remedies for nondisclosure unless there was fraud by the insured still as per Section
21A of the Insurance Contracts Act (Australia) 1984 as amended.
Cambodia
The first Cambodian Law on Insurance was enacted in 2000 and later revised in 2014 which
made a clear reference to the principle of utmost good faith.

109 Insurance Contracts Act (Australia) 1984 as amended


Article 9 of the Cambodian Law on Insurance 2014 states that;
“In making insurance contracts, the insured and insured shall respect the principle of
utmost good faith, mutual benefit, and unanimity through negotiation and shall not harm
the public interests110”.
Article 10 of the Cambodia Law on Insurance states that;
“The insurance company must clearly explain to the insured about conditions of the
insurance contract and the meaning of the attached insurance application, certificate, and
other related documents111”.
Article 19(1) of the Cambodia Law on Insurance stipulates that where the insurance company
finds out that the insured concealed the truth or intentionally misrepresented the material facts
which led to any change in the risk of the insured subject matter, the insurance contract shall
be voidable. However, it must be noted that the insurer is barred from voiding the contract
while the insured’s misrepresentation or non-disclosure is unintentional or made under the
circumstances of forgetfulness as per Article 19(2) of the Cambodian Law on Insurance.
WARRANTIES IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS
United Kingdom
Section 33(3) of the Marine Insurance Act 1906 provided that when a Warranty is breached,
the insurer is automatically discharged from liability from the date of the breach.
Section 10 of the UK Insurance Act 2015 states that;
“Any rule of law that breach of a Warranty in a contract of insurance results in the
discharge of the insurer’s liability under the contract is abolished112”.
Section 10(7) of the UK Insurance Act 2015 amends Section 33(3) of the Marine Insurance
Act 1906 by removing the clause that “if it is not complied with, then subject to any express
provision in the policy, the insurer is discharged from liability as from the date of the breach of
the Warranty, but without prejudice to any liability incurred by him before that date.
Thus, Section 10(7) of the UK Insurance Act 2015 states that;

110 Cambodia Law on Insurance 2014
111 Cambodia Law on Insurance 2014
112 UK Insurance Act 2015


“ A Warranty is a condition which must be exactly complied with, whether it be material to
the risk or not113”.
Section 10 (2) of the UK Insurance Act 2015 further provides that an insurer has no liability
under a contract of insurance in respect of any loss occurring or attributable to something
happening after a Warranty has been breached and before it is remedied. However, it must be
noted that the liability of the insurer is not affected concerning losses occurring before the
breach of the warranty or where the breach can be remedied after it has been remedied as per
Section 10(4) of the UK Insurance Act 2015. This amends Section 34(2) of the Marine
Insurance Act 1906 which provides that when a Warranty is broken, the insured cannot avail
himself or herself of the defence that the breach had been remedied and that the Warranty was
complied with before the loss.
Section 11(1) of the UK Insurance Act 2015 provides that in a contract of insurance, other than
a term defining the risk as a whole, if compliance with a term would lead to loss of a particular
kind, loss at a particular location and loss at a particular time and if a loss occurs, and the term
has not been complied with, the insurer may not rely on the non-compliance to exclude, limit
or discharge its liability under the contract for the loss as per Section 11(2) of the UK Insurance
Act 2015. The insured ought to show that the non-compliance with the term could not have
increased the risk of the loss which occurred in the circumstances in which it occurred as per
Section 11(3) of the UK Insurance Act 2015
The High Court of Justice Chancery Division applied the above provisions in the case of
Scotbeef Ltd V D& S Storage Ltd and Anor114 where the 1st defendant agreed to freeze and
store meat for the claimant, however, the six pallets of meat that were transferred to the
claimant by the 1st defendant were discovered to have mold, the claimant claimed 395,588
pounds from the defendant due to the breach of the contract in regards to the storage of meat
since it was discovered to have mold and also unfit for human consumption, the defendant
denied liability and stated that the mold was not as a result of the refrigeration services provided
by them and further stated that the contract incorporated the Food Storage & Distribution
Federations(FSDF) terms and conditions which provided that the claimant was time-barred
from bringing legal proceedings against the defendant by 3rd July 2020 and that if not timebarred the breach was limited to 250 per metric ton. The issue was whether the FSDF terms

113 UK Insurance Act 2015
114 Scotbeef Ltd V D& S Storage Ltd and Anor [2024] EWHC 341


and conditions were incorporated into the contract between the parties. In dealing with the
claim, the court considered both the duty of fair representation and Warranties, and on the law
relating to Warranties court held that the statement made by the assured that it was trading on
FSDF was a representation and thus was not a warranty as per Section 9 of the UK Insurance
Act 2015.
Section 9 of the UK Insurance Act 2015 states that;
“Representations made in connection with a proposed non-consumer insurance contract or
proposed variation to a non-consumer insurance contract is not capable of being treated as
a warranty using any provision115”.
Australia
Section 24 of the Insurance Contracts Act (Australia) 1984 as amended states that:
“A statement made in or in connection with a contract of insurance, being a statement made
by or attributable to the insured, concerning the existence of a state of affairs does not have
effect as a Warranty but has effect as though it were a statement made to the insurer by the
insured during the negotiations for the contract but before it was entered into116”.
In other words, the above Section treats every statement before the contract is concluded, as a
representation rather than a warranty, so that the beach does not lead to the automatic discharge
but rather the rules and laws governing misrepresentations apply.
Section 54(1) of the Insurance Contracts Act (Australia) 1984 as amended states that;
“Where the effect of a contract would be that the insurer refuses to pay a claim, either in
whole or in part, because of some act of the insured or some other person, being an act that
occurred after the contract was entered into, the insurer may not refuse to pay the claim by
reason only of that act but the insurer’s liability in respect of the claim is reduced by the
amount that fairly represents the extent to which the insurer’s interests were prejudiced117”.
On establishing casual link upon breach of the Warranty. Section 54(2) of the Insurance
Contracts Act (Australia) 1984 as amended provides that where the act could reasonably be
regarded as being capable of causing or contributing to a loss in respect of which insurance
cover is provided by the contract, the insurer may refuse to pay the claim. However, where the

115 UK Insurance Act 2015
116 Insurance Contracts Act (Australia) 1984 as amended
117 Insurance Contracts Act (Australia) 1984 as amended


insured proves that no part of the loss that gave rise to the claim was caused by the act, the
insured may not refuse to pay the claim based on that fact as per Section 54(3) of the Insurance
Contracts Act (Australia) 1984 as amended.
Thus, Section 54 of the Insurance Contracts Act (Australia) 1984 as amended stipulates the
amendment of the common law principles concerning Warranties and abolishes the automatic
discharge of the insurer’s liability as the remedy is to pay the amount that is proportionate to
the extent to which the insurer’s interests have been prejudiced.
Nigeria
The laws governing warranties in Nigeria are the Nigeria Insurance Act 2003 under Section 55
and the Marine Insurance Act 1962 (Nigeria) where Sections 34-42 are the replica of the 1906
Marine Insurance Act Section 33.
Section 55(1) of the Nigeria Insurance Act 2003 provides that in a contract of insurance, a
breach of a Warranty does not give rise to any right by or afford a defense to the insurer against
the insured unless the term is material and relevant to the risk or loss insured against.
And section 55(2) of the Nigeria Insurance Act 2003 states that;
“Where there is a breach of a contract of insurance, the insurer shall not be entitled to
repudiate the whole or part of the contract or a claim brought on the grounds of breach
unless the breach amounts to breach or the breach was a fundamental term of the
contract118”.
However, it must be noted that where there is a breach of a material term of a contract of
insurance and the insured makes a claim against the insurer and the insurer is not entitled to
repudiate the whole or any part of the contract, the insurer shall be liable to indemnify the
insured only to the extent of the loss which would have been suffered if there was no breach of
the term as per Section 55(3) of the Nigeria Insurance Act 2003.
Thus, the provisions in the Nigeria Insurance Act 2003 abolish the automatic discharge of the
insurer’s liability in Nigeria and also provide for a causal link connection between the breach
and the loss, a similar position in the UK Insurance Act 2015

118 Nigeria Insurance Act 2003


New Zealand
The Marine Insurance Act 1908 of New Zealand was similar to the 1906 UK Marine Insurance
Act. However, the New Zealand Insurance Law Reform Act 1977(ILRA) made some reforms
also relating to the law of Warranties in the insurance industry.
Section 5 of the New Zealand Insurance Law Reform Act 1977 states that;
“A contract of insurance shall not be avoided by reason only of any statement made in any
proposal or other document on faith of which the contract was entered into, reinstated or
renewed by the insurer unless the statement was substantially incorrect and was material119”.
Section 11(a) of the New Zealand Insurance Law Reform Act 1977 provides that whereby the
provisions of a contract of insurance, the circumstances in which the insurer is bound to
indemnify the insured against loss are so defined as to exclude or limit the liability of the insurer
to indemnify the insured on the happening of certain events or the existence of certain
circumstances.
Section 11(b) of the New Zealand Insurance Law Reform Act 1977states that;
“Where in the view of the court or arbitrator in determining the claim of the insured, the
liability of the insurer has been so defined because the happening of such events or the
existence of such circumstances was in the view of the insurer likely to increase the risk of
such loss occurring, the insured shall not be disentitled to be indemnified by the insurer by
reason only of such provisions of the contract of insurance if the insured proves on the
balance of probability that the loss in respect of which the insured seeks to be indemnified
was not caused or contributed to by happening of such events or the existence of such
circumstances120”.
In other words, Section 11 of the New Zealand Insurance Law Reform Act 1977 abolishes the
automatic discharge of the insurer’s liability in case of breach of a Warranty and requires a
limitation and exclusion or any other binding contractual obligation on the insured to deny him
his expected benefits under the insurance contract and also requires that the breach must be
connected to the loss and also for the court/ arbitrator to define the circumstances of the
insurer’s liability.

119 New Zealand Insurance Law Reform Act 1977
120 New Zealand Insurance Law Reform Act 1977


The principle of utmost good faith, law governing the principle of utmost good faith in the UK
was the 1906 Marine Insurance Act which is similar to the position in Uganda, however, the
position in the UK was later amended by the UK Insurance Act 2015 which introduces aspects
of fair representations, provide for different remedies depending on the kind of breach and this
is also provided for in countries like Cambodia, Australia.
On the law relating to Warranties in the insurance industry, both the UK, Australia, Nigeria,
and New Zealand, which had similar provisions as the 1906 Marine Insurance Act, amended
their laws on the law relating to Warranties thus a shift from the traditional common law
approach where the insurer was automatically discharged from liability upon breach of a
warranty and also on the need to establish a causal link between the breach and the loss among
others.















CHAPTER 4; SUMMARY OF FINDINGS, PROPOSALS FOR REFORMS,
RECOMMENDATIONS, AND CONCLUSION.
The Marine Insurance Act 2002 is the law that governs the principle of utmost good faith and
the law relating to Warranties in Uganda. the different provisions are the replica of the Marine
Insurance Act 1906. The Law Commission later noted unfair aspects of the provisions in the
Marine Insurance Act 1906, thus proposed the need for amendment which led to the enactment
of the UK Insurance Act 2015.
This chapter summarizes research findings, analyses the need for reforms in the current law
relating to Warranties and the principle of utmost good faith in the Insurance Industry,
recommendations, and conclusions.
SUMMARY OF FINDINGS
Insurance contracts are based on the principle of utmost good faith as per Section 17 of the
Marine Insurance Act 2002. Breach of the principle of utmost good faith entitles any of the
parties to the insurance contract to avoid the contract as per Section 17 of the Marine Insurance
Act 2002
The agent at Sanlam Insurance Company and the Respondents at the Insurance Regulatory
Authority noted that the law (theory) on the principle of utmost good faith stipulated under the
Marine Insurance Act 2002 is not different from what is in practice, thus once there is a breach
of the principle of utmost good faith, any of the parties to the insurance contract may avoid the
contract.
The provisions of the principle of utmost good faith in the Marine Insurance Act 2002 are a
replica of the Marine Insurance Act 1906 of the United Kingdom. However, the UK has since
changed its provisions on the principle of utmost good faith with the enactment of the UK
Insurance Act 2015 which introduces the duty of fair presentation which means the duty to
disclose in a manner that is reasonably clear and accessible to a prudent insurer as per Section
3(1) of the UK Insurance Act 2015.
Section 7(4) of the UK Insurance Act 2015 provides for examples of material circumstances to
be disclosed by the insured regarding the principle of utmost good faith like; unusual facts that
relate to the risk


In case of a breach of this duty, the insurer has more than one remedy as it depends on whether
the breach was deliberate or reckless as per the 1st Schedule of the UK Insurance Act 2015.
Furthermore, the UK Insurance Act 2015 introduces a duty on the insurer to inform the insured
about the principle of Utmost good faith in the industry.
Due to the unfair aspects of the principle of utmost good faith, countries that had the same
provision as stipulated in the 1906 Marine Insurance, like Australia, Cambodia have since
changed their provisions on the principle of Utmost good faith to provide for the duty of the
insurer to inform the insured about the principle of utmost good faith.
Also, some other countries have also amended their laws for example Australia as discussed in
Chapter 3, The Insurance Contracts Amendment Act 2013 of (Australia) provides for the duty
of utmost good faith and extends this duty to third-party beneficiaries, also provides that the
insurer must inform the insured about the duty of utmost good faith.
It was also noted that with the enactment of the UK Insurance Act 2015, most countries like
Malta, Saudi Arabia, and Nigeria have advocated for a change of their principle of utmost good
faith to include in their Acts the provisions under the Insurance Contracts Amendment Act
2013 of (Australia) and the UK Insurance Act 2015.
Some of the Respondents at IRA noted that the UK has fair provisions when it comes to the
duty of utmost good faith and thus stated that codification of these provisions into the Marine
Insurance Act 2002 is an advantage to the insurance industry.
Warranties in the Insurance Industry
Warranties are governed by the Marine Insurance Act 2002. Where the Warranties are not
complied with, the insurer is automatically discharged from liability as of the date of the breach.
The general rule is that Warranties require strict compliance and it does not matter whether the
breach is connected to the risk or loss suffered. However, practice in the Ugandan Insurance
industry is that where the breach is not connected to the loss/risk suffered, the insurer and the
insured come to a round table and negotiate, but this is at the option of the insurer as noted by
the Insurance agent at Sanlam Insurance Company.
The provisions in the Marine Insurance Act 2002 are a replica of the Marine Insurance Act
1906, however, the UK has since changed its provisions in the UK Insurance Act 2015 which
abolishes the automatic discharge of the insurer’s liability and also provides that where the


breach of a Warranty is remedied before a risk/loss occurs, the insurer is not discharged from
liability.
If an insured who is in breach of a Warranty shows that the non-compliance with the Warranty
did not increase the risk of the loss, the circumstances in which it occurred, the insurer cannot
rely on this breach to discharge its liability as per Section 11 of the UK Insurance Act 2015
Also, some countries for example Australia have changed their laws relating to Warranties
where the Insurance Contracts Amendment Act 2013 of (Australia) abolishes the automatic
discharge of the insurers liability upon breach and also establishes the need to show a causal
link between the breach and the loss. All the Respondents noted that is a good position in the
Insurance industry in Uganda, and adopting the same would be advantageous to the industry.
The Respondent at IRA noted that in practice because most insureds do not read the policy and
the insurers do not have an obligation to read the policy to the insured, the IRA has introduced
the KFD (key Facts Documents) which requires the Insurer to summarize the key facts in the
documents on the first page and also KYC (Know Your Client) which is to protect the insured
and also for the insurer to know the client they are dealing with and the policy they want.
PROPOSALS FOR REFORMS
The principle of Utmost good faith
In this chapter, the challenges noted by Justice Stephen Musota in National Insurance
Corporation V Sylvan Kakugu121 are considered to assess the need for statutory reforms on the
duty of utmost good faith; where he stated that the duty of utmost good faith provided for under
Sections 17,18,19,20 and 21 of the Marine Insurance Act 2002 is unfair because; the insured
can be unaware of their duty to disclose information, the only remedy for breach of utmost
good faith is avoiding the entire contract, the insurer is not required to show that the none
disclosure or misrepresentation had any causal link to the claim to avoid the contract and also
the insured is required to provide material information that would influence the judgment of a
prudent insurer and that the insured is held responsible even if the error was reasonable in the
circumstances.

121 National Insurance Corporation V Sylvan Kakugu Civil Appeal No. 040 of 2015


The insured can be unaware of their duty to disclose information; Section 18 of the Marine
Insurance Act 2002 provides that the insured must disclose every material circumstance that is
deemed to be known by the insured before the contract is concluded.
One of the Respondents at Sanlam Insurance Company stated that the practice in Uganda is
similar to the position stipulated under Sections 17,18,19 and 20 of the Marine Insurance Act
2002, thus requiring the insured to disclose every material circumstance to the insurer and if
not disclosed the insurer may avoid the contract.
One of the reasons for the proposals for reforms by the Law Commission122 was that most
laymen are unaware of the duty to disclose certain information and it is difficult for these people
to also tell which information is material and which information is not material. Hasson, R123
noted that the doctrine of utmost good faith assumes that the insured is in a stronger position
and thus requires the insured to disclose all the information, however, noted that this is unfair
especially where the insurer asks general questions. The Law Commission124 also noted that
there is a need for reform to cure the unfairness thus proposing that general questions after
specific questions have been asked ought to be avoided.
Section 18 of the Marine Insurance Act 2002 does not provide for a duty on the insurer to
inform the insured about the duty of utmost good faith, thus this research proposes the need for
reform of Section 18 of the Marine Insurance Act 2002 to provide for a duty on the insurer to
inform the insured about the principle of utmost good faith.
The insurer is not required to show that the nondisclosure or misrepresentation had any
causal link to the claim. Justice Stephen Musota in National Insurance Corporation V Sylvan
Kakugu125noted that for example if a claim related to flood damage is submitted, if it is
discovered that the insured failed to disclose that their alarm system was not working as
required by the contract, the insurer could avoid the contract.
However as noted by one of the insurance agents at Sanlam and the Respondents at the
Insurance Regulatory Authority, in practice, the insurer has to show a causal link between the
loss and the breach to avoid the policy, thus where there is no causal link, the insurer is under

122 Law Commission Report, Insurance Law: Non-Disclosure and Breach of Warranty, Cmnd 8064, Law Comm
123 Hasson, R, ‘The doctrine of uberrima fides in insurance law – a critical evaluation’ (1969) 32 MLR 615
124 Law Commission Report, Insurance Law: Non-Disclosure and Breach of Warranty, Cmnd 8064, Law Comm
125 National Insurance Corporation V Sylvan Kakugu Civil Appeal No. 040 of 2015


an obligation to pay the claim. The respondent at the Insurance Regulatory Authority stated
that much as this is not what is provided under the Insurance laws of Uganda, they also look at
common law when dealing with these issues, however noted that codification of such provision
into the laws of Uganda would be of great advantage. Thus stated the need for reform in this
area and the Insurance laws in Uganda.
The only remedy for breach of the duty of utmost good faith is avoidance of the contract
as per Section 17 of the Marine Insurance Act 2002. Justice Stephen Musota in National
Insurance Corporation V Sylvan Kakugu126noted that this is one of the unfair aspects of the
principle of utmost good faith in Uganda, thus advocating for reforms. The law Commission
before the enactment of the UK Insurance Act 2015 noted that the Marine Insurance Act 1906
provided for only one remedy in case of breach of the principle of utmost good faith, thus noted
that it was unfair to the insured thus proposed the need for statutory amendments thus the
different remedies under the UK Insurance Act 2015 depending on whether there was a
qualifying breach or innocent misrepresentation.
Schedule 1 of the UK Insurance Act 2015 provides that if the qualifying breach was deliberate
or reckless, then the insurer may avoid the policy and refuse to pay the claims and they do not
have to return the premium.
Paragraph 4 of the First Schedule UK Insurance Act 2015 states that;
“In the absence of a qualifying breach, if the insurer would not have entered into the
contract, the insurer may avoid the contract and refuse to pay all claims however must return
the premium127”.
Paragraph 5 of the First Schedule of the UK Insurance Act 2015 states that;
“Where the insurer would have entered the contract on different terms, then the contract is
to be treated as if the contract had been entered on those different terms if the insurer
requires128”.
In Uganda, the Marine Insurance Act 2002 provides for only one remedy upon breach of the
principle of utmost good faith which is avoidance of the contract, thus as noted by Justice
Stephen Musota in National Insurance Corporation V Sylvan Kakugu129, this is unfair thus the

126 National Insurance Corporation V Sylvan Kakugu Civil Appeal No. 040 of 2015
127 UK Insurance Act 2015
128 UK Insurance Act 2015
129 National Insurance Corporation V Sylvan Kakugu Civil Appeal No. 040 of 2015


need for reform to provide for more than one remedy upon breach of the principle of utmost
good faith.
The insured is held responsible even if the breach was reasonable in the circumstances.
Justice Stephen Musota in National Insurance Corporation V Sylvan Kakugu130noted that even
when the question was unclear or required specific knowledge that the insured did not have,
the insured is still held to be in breach of the duty of the principle of utmost good faith, which
is unfair to the insured. It must be noted that some of the writers for example Hasson, R131
noted that the insurer should not be allowed to advantage of the ambiguous situations in the
proposal form thus proposing the need for reforms.
The Marine Insurance Act 2002 is silent on who is held liable if the breach is reasonable in the
circumstances, however as noted by Justice Stephen Musota in National Insurance Corporation
V Sylvan Kakugu132, the practice is that the insured is held liable if the breach was reasonable
in the circumstances which is unfair in the circumstances thus advocating the need for reform
The Law relating to Warranties
On the other hand, Section 33(3) of the Marine Insurance Act 2002 states that;
“A Warranty must be strictly complied with whether it is material or not and if it is not
complied with, the insurer is discharged from liability as from the date of the breach of the
Warranty, without prejudice to any liability incurred by the insurer before the breach133.”
Warranties require strict compliance as per this provision. One of the Respondents at Sanlam
Insurance Company noted that one of the most crucial Warranty is the continuing Warranty
which requires the policyholder to refrain or do something and the insurance companies
consider whether one has been obliging with the Warranty also noted however that in practice,
the breach ought to be connected to the breach, thus where the breach is not connected to the
loss, the insurer and the insured come to a round table and negotiate but this is still at the option
of the insurer.
Section 34(2) of the Marine Insurance Act 2002 states that;

130 National Insurance Corporation V Sylvan Kakugu Civil Appeal No. 040 of 2015
131 Hasson, R, ‘The doctrine of uberrima fides in insurance law – a critical evaluation’ (1969) 32 MLR 615
132 National Insurance Corporation V Sylvan Kakugu Civil Appeal No. 040 of 2015
133 Marine Insurance Act 2002


“Where a warranty is breached, the insured cannot rely on the defence that the breach has
been remedied and that the warranty was complied with before the loss134”.
One of the Respondents at the Insurance Regulatory Authority noted that the recent UK
Insurance Act 2015 protects the insured as there is no automatic discharge of the insurer’s
liability in case of breach of a Warranty as per Section 10 of the UK Insurance Act 2015 which
abolishes the automatic discharge of the insurer. Also noted that the insurer has no liability
where there is a breach of a Warranty and before it is remedied, however where the breach is
remedied before the loss, the Insurer is not discharged from liability as per Section 10(4) of the
UK Insurance Act 2015. And further noted that this is better compared to the position in Uganda
thus stating that codification of these provisions would be better for the Ugandan Insurance
Industry. Thus, proposals for reform of the provisions of the law relating to warranties in
Uganda.
RECOMMENDATIONS
Certain recommendations are supposed to be put into consideration to improve the law relating
to Warranties and the principle of utmost good faith in the Ugandan Insurance Industry. These
are;
Principle of Utmost good faith
Amendment of the Marine Insurance Act 2002
The current law governing the principle of Utmost good faith in the Insurance Industry in
Uganda is the Marine Insurance Act 2002 under Sections 17,18,19,20 and 21.
There is a need to amend the Act to provide for the duty of fair representation which means
that the disclosure ought to be made in a reasonably clear and accessible manner and this is
mainly to prevent the insured from bombarding the insurer with a lot of information as provided
by the UK Insurance Act 2015
The Marine Insurance Act 2002 does not impose a duty on the insurer to inform the Insured
about the principle of utmost of utmost good faith. This is similar to the amendment provided
for by the Insurance Contracts Amendment Act 2013 of (Australia) where the rationale is to
ensure that the insured is informed about what is to be disclosed and also the fact that Insurance
contracts are governed by the principle of utmost good faith.

134 Marine Insurance Act 2002


Furthermore, currently, the Act provides for only one remedy in case of a breach which is
avoidance of the insurance contract, thus there is a need for the Parliament to amend the Act to
provide for various remedies for example remedies for qualifying breach (where it is deliberate
or reckless and where it is neither) and also remedies for breach in cases for innocent
misrepresentation.
Amendment of the Insurance Act 2017
One of the respondents on the legal team at IRA noted that much as different case law has
stated that the provisions on the principle of utmost good faith in the Marine Insurance Act
2002 apply to all aspects of insurance, there is a need for the amendment of the Insurance Act
2017, to provide for general provisions on the law relating to the principle of utmost good faith
in insurance instead of relying on the Marine Insurance Act 2002.
The law relating to Warranties
The law governing Warranties in the Insurance Industry is the Marine Insurance Act 2002
Amendment of the Marine Insurance Act 2002
Currently, the Marine Insurance Act 2002 under Section 33(3) provides that the insurer is
automatically discharged from liability upon breach of a Warranty. However, as the Law
Commission noted before the enactment of the UK Insurance Act 2015, this is unfair to the
insured and favours the insurer to a large extent, since upon breach the Insured does not have
any other remedy. Thus, a need for proposals for reform of the law relating to Warranties so
that the insured is not automatically discharged from liability.
Furthermore, the current Marine Insurance Act 2002 under Section 34(2) provides that the
insured cannot rely on the defence that the breach of the Warranty was remedied before the
loss/ risk. This means that where there is a breach of a Warranty, it does not matter where the
breach has been remedied before the loss/ risk, the insurer is still discharged from liability. As
noted by the Law Commission before the enactment of the UK Insurance Act 2015, such a
provision is also unfair to the insured since some of the Warranty(breach) can be remedied,
thus the insurer being discharged from liability is unfair to the insured. Thus, the a need for
amendment of Section 34(2) of the Marine Insurance Act 2002.


Also, one of the Respondents at Sanlam Insurance Company noted that in practice, in case of
a breach of a Warranty, the insurer is supposed to show a causal link between the loss and the
breach and further noted that codification of such a provision would also protect the insured.
Amendment of the Insurance Act 2017
One of the respondents on the legal team at the Insurance Regulatory Authority (IRA) noted
that much as different case law has stated that the law relating to Warranties in the Marine
Insurance Act 2002 applies to all aspects of insurance, there is a need for the amendment of the
Insurance Act 2017, to provide for general provisions on the law relating to Warranties instead
of relying on the Marine Insurance Act 2002.
Sensitization of the masses
This was noted by one of the respondents at IRA that sensitization of the masses about the need
to read the insurance industry will improve the relations in the insurance industry in Uganda.
This also includes making the different people aware of the IRA, where they can submit their
complaints in case of any, and also the KFD (key Facts Documents) which requires the Insurer
to summarize the key facts in the documents on the first page and also KYC (Know Your Client)
which is to protect the insured and also for the insurer to know the client they are dealing with
and the policy they want.
The general objective of this research was to analyse the need for amendment of the principle
of utmost good faith and the law relating to Warranties. From the research conducted and
feedback from the different respondents, and different desktop research conducted, there is a
need for an amendment of the law relating to the principle of utmost good faith to provide that
any rule that a contract of insurance can be avoided on the ground of breach of the principle of
utmost good faith by the other party is abolished and to include the duty of fair presentation
whose rationale is to prevent the insured from bombarding the insurer with a lot of information,
the duty on the insurer to inform the insured about this duty and also to provide for different
remedies upon breach of the principle of utmost good faith.
On the other hand, there is a need to amend the law relating to Warranties, to abolish the
automatic discharge of the insurer’s liability upon breach of the Warranty, to abolish the
provision that the breach of a Warranty cannot be remedied before a loss occurs and also to
need the need to establish a causal link upon breach by the insurer among others.
