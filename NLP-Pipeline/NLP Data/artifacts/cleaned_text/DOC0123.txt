CHAPTER ONE: THE PROBLEM AND ITS SETTING
1.1 Introduction
This chapter covered the background of the study, statement of the problem, main objective,
specific objectives, research questions, significance of the study, scope of the study, and
limitations of the study.
1.2 Background of the Study
The phenomenon of healing and deliverance has become very common and central to the
religious activities of most churches in Ghana.1 Kwabena J. Asamoah-Gyadu explains
healing and deliverance from a charismatic point of view as 'the deployment of divine power
and authority in the name or blood of Jesus perceived in pneumatological terms as the
intervention of the Holy Spirit to provide release for demon-possessed, demon-oppressed,
broken, disturbed and troubled persons in order that victims may be restored to proper
functioning order, that is, to health and wholeness and being thus freed from demonic
influence and curses, they may enjoy God’s fullness of life understood to be available in
Christ.
From
this
the
perspective,
healing
and
deliverance,
is
considered
to be an avenue as well as the practice which employs certain Christian religious activities
with
the
purpose
of
responding
to
the
human
existential
needs.
According to Asamoah-Gyadu, "healing and deliverance" ministry has become popular in
African contexts such as Ghana because it takes the African worldviews of mystical causality
seriously. This Christianity promises Christian alternatives to the search for security that
drives people into the courts of other religious functionaries.
Contrasting the African nature of churches with the western mission churches (Allan
Anderson) argued that the churches are motivated by a desire to meet the physical, emotional
and spiritual needs of Africans, offering solutions to life’s problems and finding ways to cope
with the threatening and anxieties of a hostile world. This rapid growth, according to
(Anderson), is attributed to the churches’ focus on making meaning of the contemporary
existential problems that confront Christians through their contextualization approach.

This explanation indicates that the ministry of healing and deliverance focuses on enabling
believers to experience spiritual freedom and physical healing and wholeness. The gift of
healing as addressed in 1 Corinthians 12:28 and in discover your Spiritual Gifts by Wagner


(2012) implies that the use of the word healing is not restricted to physical disease. Rather, it
can also be used to refer to cure of mental, emotional and spiritual illnesses (2012, p.12).

According to Wagner (2012), the ministry of healing and deliverance or spiritual healing is a
gift that can be exercised alongside other gift of the Spirit. In fact he writes concerning this
ministry that; Christians should be aware that the gifts of the Spirit, such as exhortation,
wisdom, knowledge, the discerning of spirits, tongues, the interpretation of tongues,
intercession, and deliverance can complement and be used along with gifts of healing. For
those who are emotionally wounded but not demonized, gifts of healing, exhortation and
intercession are crucial (2012, p. 16).

While according what Wagner statement above, most emotional hurts do not result in
demonization, but if an emotional wounded person is demonized, that person can best be
helped by someone who has either the gift of exorcism, discerning of spirits, tongues,
interpretation of tongues, or intercession. As the church ministers to her followers, it is
important to incorporate the ministry of healing and deliverance. According to what scholars
write about apostolic church, healing and deliverance are central to the ministry of the
Church. In the Apostolic church the bishop was the focus for the mission of the Church,
following in the footsteps of Jesus, who commissioned his apostles to preach, to teach, and to
heal writes Harris and Clarke (1964) in
Liturgy and Worship: A Companion to a Prayer Book for Anglican Communion.

In order to carry out this ministry of healing and deliverance, Hejzalar (2010), in the two
Paradigms of Divine Healing, writes that the attitude of Christ towards those with diseases,
mental, physical illness should critically and carefully appropriated in the church’s actual
exercise of carrying out the ministry of healing in this contemporary times (2010, p. 41). The
use of the gift of healing and deliverance seems to be catching up in the Church of Uganda.
Concerning the growth of this ministry in Anglican Church;

In the Province of Anglican Church of Uganda hundreds of traditional Anglican churches
have been set on fire by the Holy Spirit. For example, All Saints Church in Kabwohe has
shrunk to a handful of people a few years ago. But today the 400-seat building cannot
contain the throngs of worshippers who show up for Sunday or mid-week services therefore


it’s against this background that the research wants to assess the low involvement of ministers
in the Diocese of Lango.
1.3 The Statement of the Problem
The ministry of healing and deliverance has a very important role to play in developing and
deliverance of the Christian. Whereas in Church of Uganda today, not more than 70% of the
Anglican bishops are open to charismatic renewal, the ministry has been ignored, misused
and carried out without proper theological consideration. The few churches that carry out this
ministry have not involved proper biblical teachings, and hence the exercise of this gift has
brought confusion and manipulation. In order to address the above issues in this ministry, this
study sought to assess the low involvement of church ministers in the healing and deliverance
ministry so as to find out the strategies to make it effective and theologically sound.
1.4 Purpose
To assess the reasons for the low involvement of ministers in the Healing and Deliverance
Ministry in Diocese of Lango
1.4.1 Specific Objectives.
To assess the knowledge of healing and deliverance among ministers
To assess the belief in healing and deliverance ministry by the church ministers
To analyses the priority of the church towards healing and deliverance
1.4.2 Research Questions
1- What level of knowledge do the church ministers have on Healing and Deliverance?
2- What belief do the church ministers have on healing and deliverance?
3- What priority do the church ministers have on Healing and Deliverance ministry?
1.5 Significance of the Study
This research seeks to assess solutions and way forward that will help churches in the
Diocese of Lango that’s overseen by Rev Can Dr. Alfred Olwa to understand the value of the
healing and deliverance to the church. In addition, the church will think about the best way to
establish and intensify her ministry to the region through and intensified establishment of
committed healing and deliverance by ministers.


1.6 Scope of the Study.
The study will concentrate on the geographical scope, content scope and time scope.
1.6.1 Geographical Scope.
The research was carried out in the Diocese of Lango in north part of Uganda, where the
ethnic language is Luo.
1.6.2 Content Scope.
The study was limited to examining how the church can establish and intensify its ministry to
the region through healing and deliverance exampled in St. Peter’s Parish St. Paul’s Deanery
Diocese of Lango.
1.6.3 Time Scope.
The study covered the period between Jan to Dec 2021 because for the past two years, there
has been an increase in number of Christians that are unable to go and pray and communicate
to their God due to the low involvement of ministers in healing and deliverance in Lango Sub
region as all.
1.6.4 Justification
This research addresses the ways how the church can establish and intensify its ministry to
the Lango Dioceses through healing and deliverance in line with evangelism.
1.6.5 Limitations of the study
The following were the limitations of the study:
Some respondents conceal information or give false information because they may think that
the researcher wants it for his personal benefit. However, the researcher assured the
respondents of confidentiality.
Respondents feel that the researcher is interfering with their work and ministry which may
lead to inappropriate findings. The researcher explained to the respondents that the
information is only needed for academic purpose.
Some respondents didn’t understand vitality and conceptual evaluation of the exercise
especially the implicated group of the ministers, some had wrong assessment of the
questionnaire.
The researcher read and interprets the questions to them. He also tried to explain using some
local language for those who couldn’t understand English language properly.


The effect of Covid-19 also affected the methods the researcher has planned to employ in
gathering information. This was overcome by observing the Standard Operating Procedures
like social distancing and wearing of face masks.
Time was not enough for the researcher to gather enough and relevant information. This
challenge was overcome by sampling technique.
Interruptions by weather changes like rain which makes roads impassable. The researcher
resolves by the improvising umbrella and move on foot.
Lastly, resources like money limit my findings. The researcher tries to economize and budget
for the little resources available. He also improvises by limiting the questionnaires.











CHAPTER TWO
LITERATURE REVIEW
Literature review means the works the researcher consulted in order to understand and
investigate the research problem. This section covers books, journals, reports and websites
that contain the scholarly work other people have written concerning elderly ministry. It was
also to review the ways how the church can establish the involving ministry, the role of
deliverance and healing ministry of the church.
2.1. How the Church can Order its Ministry to include Healing and Deliverance
Christian Healing Ministries in Jacksonville, Florida is a charismatic organization that
promotes and practices Christian healing. Although known for healing prayers, its worldview
is more holistic and includes different kinds of prayers that address emotional, psychological,
spiritual and bodily health.
Deliverance prayer is of particular interest because it imagines a world of “spirit attachments”
that are introduced to the body through multiple origins including trauma, inappropriate
lifestyle, genealogical history, and intentional or incidental occult involvement. However,
deliverance ministry is particularly difficult to give explanation to since its imagined world of
spirits is dissimilar to naturalistic explanations of disease. The contention of this paper is that
deliverance prayer is performative in which the participants symbolically interact with each
other in ritual situations consenting to an imagined reality. Findings are based on participant
observations and interviews and are placed in the context of symbolic interaction and
performance.
The Practice of Healing and Deliverance in the Church Ministry enables the church to offer a
holistic process of spiritual, emotional and physical well- being and wholeness of the
believers. Hunter (1990) in the Dictionary for Pastoral Care and Counseling wrote that
healing is the process of being restored to bodily wholeness, emotional well- being, mental
functioning, and spiritual aliveness. His description shows how Christian modes of healing
have always distinguished themselves by achieving a spiritual advance in connection with the
healing process. Healing may also refer to the process of reconciling broken human
relationships and to the development of a just social and political order among races and
nations (Candy, 2011, p.64). This definition seems to focus on the social dimension of
healing. However, it ignores that spiritual dimension of healing.



Like the Corinthian Church which had spiritual gifts the Church in Lango Diocese also
emphasizes spiritual healing and deliverance. For instance, 1 Corinthians 12:9 refers to
“gifts” of healing in the plural, which may indicate that there are different gifts of healing.
The gifts of healing could mean a very wide range of skills or abilities. This could be from
the power to do miraculous or dramatic healing, like making the lame walk, or the use or
understanding of medicine. It could even be the ability to empathize and show love to others
to the point of healing an emotional wound of which they are done in Lango Diocese.
2.2. The Role of the Church in enhancing the Healing and Deliverance Ministry.
The ministry of healing and deliverance can be strengthened through forming prayer groups.
Shoemaker (1964) says that united prayer never fails, to live to some kind of constructive
action. It seems to sharpen and focus all of our faculties, and we are led to do things
ordinarily we should never think of doing. He adds that group prayer sets up a positive chain
reaction which no one can foresee the end (1964, p 144). Whether people meet as a family or
in prayer study groups or meet in person “for special intentions” where two agree to pray
together for a particular concern, or meet at the altar rail; the result is always the same power
is released, people are healed and changed, hope is reborn., and above all they do their small
share in fulfilling Jesus vision: “that they be one; as though father, art in me and I in thee; that
they may be one in us that the world may believe that thou have sent me” John 17:21”.
Pearson (1970) healing is God’s act of love to say that God is love and yet not see him at
work in people’s lives is a cruel contraction. The God we worship is not an absentee land
lord, but a loving, caring father who ministers to his children at their points of need.
Sometimes the need is for healing. Therefore, healing and deliverance should be seen and
conducted in God’s love not for money and self-exaltation. In Luke chapter 4, Jesus began
teaching about the kingdom of God and healing the sick, healing was the major part of the
ministry of Jesus. His very name means salvation, a word suggesting more than forgiveness
of sin unto eternal life. The word literally means wholeness (1970, p 13). Our Lord’s earthly
ministry was to minister this wholeness in every area of our lives. God invested Christ in us
when he sent him to die for our sins. And he intends to keep up his investment. Put other
way, God, who loves his enemies so much as to send Christ to die for us (Romans, 5:8-10).
According to Pearson (1970), the African Independent Churches (AIC), which arose in the
1920s and 1930s, accepted spirit possession and witchcraft possession as a real phenomenon
that needed to be dealt with by the power of prayer. The prophets cast out spirits by means of


prayer, holy water and the Bible. In the 1950s and 1960s, the Pentecostal missionaries found
a similar response as they ministered to people they considered to be possessed by the powers
of witchcraft. Even today it’s true that spirit possession is a real phenomenon that exists in
the church in Lango Diocese, and if the church could embrace the idea of healing and
deliverance, demonic attacks and possession can be dealt with” (1970, p 13)
Onyinah (2012) brings out testimonies of Ghanaians, in his book Pentecostal Exorcism, who,
were involved in the traditional religions and had been delivered from satanic powers and
began to share their testimonies. They began preaching on the need to receive Christ. Their
testimonies have become useful materials for evangelism for some churches. Testimonies are
one of the ways to witness to others like the man who was born blind that Jesus gave sight to,
“he said to Pharisees that I was blind but now I see”. This will encourage others who are
possessed to come for deliverance instead of running to which” (2012, p 147).
2.3. The Role of the Ordained Church Ministers in the Healing and Deliverance
Ministry in the Church.
Shoemaker (1967), Heb 4:12 say the word of God is alive and powerful than a double-edged
sword, a very powerful weapon against the forces of evil and darkness. A spiritual
renaissance among God-fearing people of the world is more to be feared by evil principalities
and powers than nuclear weapons, Satan trembles when he sees the weakest saint upon his
knees (1967, p 14). Opok (2012) there is need for practitioners of the ministry of healing and
deliverance to walk in the spirit. This ministry is affected by prosperity gospel which is a sign
of “walking in the flesh”.He adds that St. Paul sees the greatest threat to the believer’s life as
the flesh. The major area that the devil can use to harass the believer is giving him ground to
walk according to the flesh. He realizes that by walking in the spirit, the believer is able to
overcome the flesh” (2012, p 279).
Deliverance is a very common and important aspect of the healing ministry. It is often
difficult for people living in our society to recognize the real presence of Satan and evil
spirits, yet it is a continuous theme running throughout the Gospels and the New Testament:
"For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities,
against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly
realms" (Eph. 6: 12).
God has designed that all of us who embrace Jesus Christ be conformed to His image. “For
whom He foreknew, He also predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He


might be the firstborn among many brethren” (Romans 8:29). Jesus is the firstborn among
the brethren. The rest of the brethren are to be in the image of Jesus Christ, like Him. We
are called to walk as Christ walked. “He who says he abides in Him ought himself also to
walk just as He walked” (1 John 2:6). If Christ walked in the power of the Spirit and worked
healings, deliverances, and miracles, then we should seek to walk in these just as He did.
In the human body, He was not omnipotent. There were times He was tired and had to
rest, eat, and so on. He was chained, whipped, and nailed to the Cross. In the human
body, He was not omnipresent. He travelled on foot, in a boat, and on a donkey. In the
human body, He was not omniscient. He grew in wisdom (Luke 2:46,52). He was taught
by the Father (John 8:28). He did not know the day of the Lord (Mark 13:32).
While according to Pearson (1970), the ministry of healing and deliverance (MHD) is
challenged by poor biblical interpretation of scriptures. Since the early days of the church
there have been those who get from scripture a message far different from its plain simple
meaning. Whether this stems from blinders put on by the intellectual outlook of the day, from
a proud desire to be clever, from a refusal to believe something they themselves have not
experienced or from a desire to rewrite scripture to their own liking, the result is the same a
portion of God’s word lost as people apply their reason” (1970, p. 35).
The ministry of healing and deliverance is affected by limited Christian literature on the
subject; there are many books on prayer but it is hard to find one that is practical enough for
the average layman to utilize in his daily human experience. Books on prayer arrange
themselves in various categories and classes. Some are scholarly terms which for the layman
are dry and impractical. Some are so mystical in character that only certain types of minds
and temperaments can possibly understand them. Some emphasize narrow theological
orthodoxies. Some are so broad and visionary that they only promote wishful thinking, while
others of a more modern version are geared down to such a low level of ideology that the
cross is left out completely and individual health and happiness seem to be the only goal.
Lawrence (1996), in “The practice of Christian healing” attributes the decline in the healing
ministry in the early centuries of the church and today in some segments of the church due to
ignorance, fear, laziness and sin of its members, not the desire or purpose of God. He
emphasizes his point saying that when the church members submit to God’s will and submit
to his promises, healings happen” (1970, p35).


Opok Onyinah (2012), observes that some practices in the ministry of healing and
deliverance may be dangerous. These include extracting confessions publicly from selfclaimed witches in order to arrest attention before exorcism, since naïve people may be
responsive to suggestive stories and may assume themselves to be possessed. Again, such
confessions may put a social stigma on self- claimed witches who may never be accepted in
society again. Confession however can be done privately” (2012, p 278).
Spiritual disciplines of fasting and prayer on clients and exorcist are quite risky practices, or
the problems may be natural or sometimes they may need immediate medical attention. Still
again, publicity either before or after exorcism, writing down client’s information and
announcing them publicly or recording the process of exorcism for sale should be
discouraged, since they betray trust and may give the impression that exorcists are using their
ministries for money. For instance, I saw a pastor on television and who was advertising,
wanted to know whether their jobs will prosper them and said they should come with an
envelope of 200,000/= as “seed” offering before being prayed for. However, prayers should
be conducted in the simplest ways possible, to show the trust in the power of Jesus, who
charged them in (Luke 10:18-19) behold I given you power and authority to trample over
powers of darkness and serpents and scorpions and healing the sick. It should not in a way to
bring doubts when it’s done since rituals undermine the authority of Jesus










CHAPTER THREE
RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
3.1 Introduction.
This chapter presents study design, study area, population study, sample selection criteria,
data collection and analysis methods. The chapter also identifies the methods that the
researcher used for collecting data, the tools that was used in data analysis and interpretation.
3.2 Study Design.
Study design shows a detailed outline of how an investigation will be conducted. It includes
how data was collected, which instruments were used, how instruments were used and the
means for analyzing data that was collected. The purpose of research design was to select and
define the overall structure and methods of intended research that would enable to answer the
initial research question effectively and efficiently
The research method that was used in this study is qualitative research in which
questionnaires would be used to collect data from elderly people, the clergy, and lay readers.
Mainly questions will be about church’s care and connection with elderly people.
3.3 Study Area
The study was conducted in three churches under St. Paul Orum Parish; All Saints Church of
Uganda Obanga Pe Wany Parish and All Saints Cathedral Boroboro Chapter. The churches
are located in Lango Diocese.
3.4 Population of Study.

This research focus on church ministers, senior ministers, chaplains and the church
congregation of the Diocese of Lango.
3.5 Sample Size and Selection.
The representatives of the population under study were to ensure that findings can be got
from the research sample to the population as a whole.


The study involves respondents who are seniors in church ministry, the reverend and the lay
readers in the Diocese of Lango. The group was under the Church of the Province of Uganda
only.
3.6 Data Collection Methods and Instruments.
The researcher got a letter of introduction from the research department of Bishop Tucker
School of Divinity and Theology which present to the Diocese. The Diocese then gave him
the letter to take to the Parish priests who also give him a letter to the lay readers of the
daughter churches under the study area.
The researcher also made arrangements with minister, reverends and lay readers to ascertain
the most appropriate time. He was then brought them questionnaires to fill. The filled and
non-completed questionnaires were collected by the researcher from the respondents.
The instruments that were used in this research shall include Questionnaires for key selected
respondents.
3.7 Data Analysis.
Data analysis was the ordering of data into constituent parts in order to obtain answers to
research questions. Raw data from the field was cleaned, coded, and analyzed. It is from the
results of such analysis that the researcher was able to make sense of the data. Data was only
to be presented in form of descriptive data. It was also be analyzed according to the research
objectives.
3.8 Interview Guide
The interview guide helps the researcher to collect data from the parish priest, lay readers
and the selected elderly persons.
This interview provided the researcher with an opportunity to explore and clarify issues to
enrich the content scope and establish new insights on Church ministry to the elderly.
The interview guide contained open-ended questions which compelled the respondents to
give more unrestricted responses since open-ended questions are perceived as less
threatening. For example, “give reasons why intercession is good to you, how are church
visits important to you?” The researcher will also use “dichotomous questions” answered by
yes/no, true/false and or ticks for example, “do you still go to church?” “Are you still able to


read the Bibleregulary?” Among others. The interview guide will help the researcher to
collect data from the parish priest, lay readers and the selected elderly persons. It will also
provide him with an opportunity to explore and clarify issues to enrich the content scope and
establish new insights on Church ministry to the elderly.
3.9 Ethical considerations
During planning, collection and processing of data, the researcher followed a number of
research guidelines to maintain ethical standards which include: seeking informed consent of
the respondents and making it known that their participation is voluntary and they are free to
withdraw from the study at any time or are free not to answer questions that they are
uncomfortable with. The researcher accorded respect to the respondents’ privacy and
confidential treatment. The names of the participants will not be identified; the respondents
will remain anonymous. Approval and permission to conduct the study will be sought from
all relevant authorities.
The researcher was objective while conducting this research in order to avoid bias for
example, by collecting the necessary information himself. The researcher also display a high
level of confidentiality with data collected from the respondents by ensuring that the names
of the respondents remain anonymous.












CHAPTER FOUR
DATA PRESENTATION, ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION
4.0
Introduction
This chapter looks at the presentation, analysis and interpretation of the findings on the topic:
“Assessment of low involvement of the ministers in the healing and deliverance ministry in
the Diocese of Lango”. The data collected were from primary source through questionnaires
and interviews guides.
4.1
The characteristics of the respondents.
The findings collected were from both primary and secondary sources. The sample consisted
of 50 respondents and these were; Parish Priest (5) Lay Readers (10),Elderly (35), of the
sample size.
4.1.1 Gender, age and sex of the respondents
The researcher was interested in the age and sex of the respondents to find out what age
bracket and sex is likely to have more knowledge about healing and deliverance ministry.

The Age bracket above 55 years old are the majority with 26 out of the 50 of respondents
representing 52% while the age bracket of 36 and above of both Male and Female are active
and very productive age group which are majority of the elderly of respondents who believed
that healing and deliverance ministry is key in strengthening church performance. While the


age bracket below 40 are respondents who are minority of the respondents and are still
growing in faith of the church.
4.1.2 Respondents Marital s Status
The researcher wanted to find out the marital status of the respondents and the findings were
as below.

Findings in table 4.1.2 above shows that 72% of the respondents who are the majority, this
implies that the respondents are deeply rooted Christians who are wedded in church. The
Widowed of 22 % similarly have a lot of responsibilities as they have strong believe and love
for God. The single 4% of the respondents are newly converts through healing and
deliverance ministry who need experience form the majority. Separated respondents of 2%
although with single life they are in church as shown above.

4.1.3 Response on the level of education of the respondents
The researcher was interested in the level of education attained by the respondents who attend
church services ranging from Certificate, Diploma, Degree and others


Figure 4.1.3 Level of Education of the respondent

According to the research findings, majority of the respondents/Christians are certificate
holders with the highest level of 50% which is half of the highest level which means that
majority of the respondents are educated and know how to read and write, Diploma holders
are next with a level of 35% which shows that they understand the importance healing and
deliverance ministry. Minority of the respondents is degree holders with 5% and according to
Wagner (2012), the ministry of healing and deliverance or spiritual healing is a gift that can
be exercised alongside other gift of the Spirit. In fact he writes concerning this ministry that;
Christians should be aware that the gifts of the Spirit, such as exhortation, wisdom,
knowledge, the discerning of spirits, tongues, the interpretation of tongues, intercession, and
deliverance can complement and be used along with gifts of healing. For those who are
emotionally wounded but not demonized, gifts of healing, exhortation and intercession are
crucial (2012, p. 16) which easy for educated people.

4.1.4 Your role in church and has served for how long
The researcher wanted to find out for how long have the respondents served in the church as
a committee member and the findings were as represented in bar graph figure 3 below.
Figures 4.1.4 For how long have you served in the church committee?

The research findings show that majority of the respondents have served in the church
committee and their role for 5 years and above representing 25 of the 50 respondents, while
15 of the 50 of the respondents have work for 3-4 years old, this implies that the total of 40 in
number of the respondents are experienced and know and understand the importance healing
and deliverance ministry. Minority of 10 in number of the respondents are those that have
served for less than 3 years but are aware of healing and deliverance ministry in conformity
with the Practice of Healing and Deliverance in the Church Ministry that enables the church
to offer a holistic process of spiritual, emotional and physical well- being and wholeness of
the believers.

4.2 ASSESSMENT OF HEALING AND DELIVERANCE SERVICE
4.2.1 Do you have any Healing and Deliverance Service in your Church?
The researcher wanted to find out from the respondents whether there is healing and
deliverance service in the various Churches within Orum Archdeaconry
Table 4.2.1 Do you have any healing and deliverance service in your Church?

Total
The research finding shows that 80% of the respondents said that they have healing and
deliverance ministry but the challenge is they are not very active and according to , ( Hunter
(1990) in the Dictionary for Pastoral Care and Counseling wrote that healing is the process of
being restored to bodily wholeness, emotional well- being, mental functioning, and spiritual
aliveness. His description shows how Christian modes of healing have always distinguished
themselves by achieving a spiritual advance in connection with the healing process. Healing
may also refer to the process of reconciling broken human relationships and to the
development of a just social and political order among races and nations (Candy, 2011, p.64).
The minority of respondents of 20% said they do not have healing and deliverance ministry
contrary to (Allan Anderson) who said that Contrasting the African nature of churches with
the western mission churches which he argued that the churches are motivated by a desire to
meet the physical, emotional and spiritual needs of Africans, offering solutions to life’s
problems and finding ways to cope with the threatening and anxieties of a hostile world. This
rapid growth, according to (Anderson), is attributed to the churches’ focus on making
meaning of the contemporary existential problems that confront Christians through their
contextualization approach




4.2.2 Who else participates actively in the leadership of the Healing and Deliverance
service in your Church?
The research wanted to find out who else participates actively in the leadership of the healing
and deliverance service in your Church. Majority of the respondent agree with 70% that the
ordained and those spiritually called by God. A spiritual renaissance among God-fearing
people of the world is more to be feared by evil principalities and powers than nuclear
weapons, Satan trembles when he sees the weakest saint upon his knees (1967, p 14). Opok
(2012) there is need for practitioners of the ministry of healing and deliverance to walk in the
spirit. This ministry is affected by prosperity gospel which is a sign of “walking in the flesh”.
He adds that St. Paul sees the greatest threat to the believer’s life as the flesh. The major area
that the devil can use to harass the believer is giving him ground to walk according to the
flesh. He realizes that by walking in the spirit, the believer is able to overcome the flesh”
(2012, p 279). 30% of the respondents disagree with the statement while minority of the
respondents of 10% said they have no idea as shown in the below pie chart

4.2.3 What do you think hinders some Ordained Church Ministers from leading and
participating in the Healing and Deliverance Services in Orum Archdeaconry?
The researcher wanted to find out from the respondents’ experience and views on why some
ordained Church Ministers cannot lead and participate in the Healing and Deliverance
Services. The findings indicated that majority of the respondent with a frequency of 35.4
which represent 70.8% strongly agree with the statement and according to (Wagner (2012),
who indicated that the ministry of healing and deliverance or spiritual healing is a gift that
can be exercised alongside other gift of the Spirit. In fact, he writes concerning this ministry
that; Christians should be aware that the gifts of the Spirit, such as exhortation, wisdom,
knowledge, the discerning of spirits, tongues, the interpretation of tongues, intercession, and
deliverance can complement and be used along with gifts of healing. For those who are
emotionally wounded but not demonized, gifts of healing, exhortation and intercession are
crucial (2012, p. 16).

While according what Wagner statement above, most emotional hurts do not result in
demonization, but if an emotional wounded person is demonized, that person can best be
helped by someone who has either the gift of exorcism, discerning of spirits, tongues,
interpretation of tongues, or intercession. As the church ministers to her followers, it is
important to incorporate the ministry of healing and deliverance. According to what scholars
write about apostolic church, healing and deliverance are central to the ministry of the
Church. In the Apostolic church the bishop was the focus for the mission of the Church,
following in the footsteps of Jesus, who commissioned his apostles to preach, to teach, and to
heal writes Harris and Clarke (1964) in
Liturgy and Worship: A Companion to a Prayer Book for Anglican Communion.
The minority with a frequency of 14.6 which is 29.2% of the respondents did not agree with
the statement contrary to as detailed in the table 4.2.3 below.

4.3.1 How does the absence of the Healing and Deliverance ministry affect the spiritual
lives of the Christians in the churches of Orum Archdeaconry which do not have
healing and deliverance services?
The researcher was interested in finding out whether the absence of the Ordained Church
Ministers in the healing and deliverance ministry affects the spiritual lives of the Christians in
the churches of Orum Archdeaconry which do not have healing and deliverance services?
Majority of the respondents strongly agree with 50% those that agree were 30% and
according to Lawrence (1996), The ministry of healing and deliverance is affected by limited
Christian literature on the subject; there are many books on prayer but it is hard to find one
that is practical enough for the average layman to utilize in his daily human experience.
Books on prayer arrange themselves in various categories and classes. Some are scholarly
terms which for the layman are dry and impractical. Some are so mystical in character that
only certain types of minds and temperaments can possibly understand them. Some
emphasize narrow theological orthodoxies. Some are so broad and visionary that they only
promote wishful thinking, while others of a more modern version are geared down to such a
low level of ideology that the cross is left out completely and individual health and happiness
seem to be the only goal in “The practice of Christian healing” attributes the decline in the
healing ministry in the early centuries of the church and today in some segments of the
church due to ignorance, fear, laziness and sin of its members, not the desire or purpose of
God. He emphasizes his point saying that when the church members submit to God’s will and
submit to his promises, healings happen” (1970, p35). The minority of respondents of 10%
disagree and 6% strongly disagree according to (EFQ M 1999) who said that It is the measure
of attainment achieved by an individual team, organization or process) that determines low
performance and is as result of poorly performing healing. Only 4% of respondents were


undecided contrary to Shoemaker (1967), Heb 4:12 who said that the word of God is alive
and powerful than a double-edged sword, a very powerful weapon against the forces of evil
and darkness. A spiritual renaissance among God-fearing people of the world is more to be
feared by evil principalities and powers than nuclear weapons, Satan trembles when he sees
the weakest saint upon his knees (1967, p 14). Opok (2012) there is need for practitioners of

4.3.2 What has the Church done to support the healing and deliverance ministry in
Orum Archdeaconry?
The findings as indicated below by respondents shows that majority strongly agree with a
frequencies of 25.5 out of the 50 which is 51% and 17.5 which was 35% Agree who said
church should support healing and deliverance ministry and in conformity with Pearson
(1970) healing is God’s act of love to say that God is love and yet not see him at work in
people’s lives is a cruel contraction. The God we worship is not an absentee land lord, but a
loving, caring father who ministers to his children at their points of need. Sometimes the need
is for healing. Therefore, healing and deliverance should be seen and conducted in God’s love


not for money and self-exaltation. In Luke chapter 4, Jesus began teaching about the kingdom
of God and healing the sick, healing was the major part of the ministry of Jesus. His very
name means salvation, a word suggesting more than forgiveness of sin unto eternal life. The
word literally means wholeness (1970, p 13). Our Lord’s earthly ministry was to minister this
wholeness in every area of our lives. God invested Christ in us when he sent him to die for
our sins. And he intends to keep up his investment. Put other way, God, who loves his
enemies so much as to send Christ to die for us (Romans, 5:8-10). According to Pearson
(1970), the African Independent Churches (AIC), which arose in the 1920s and 1930s,
accepted spirit possession and witchcraft possession as a real phenomenon that needed to be
dealt with by the power of prayer. The prophets cast out spirits by means of prayer, holy
water and the Bible. In the 1950s and 1960s, the Pentecostal missionaries found a similar
response as they ministered to people they considered to be possessed by the powers of
witchcraft. Even today it’s true that spirit possession is a real phenomenon that exists in the
church in Lango Diocese, and if the church could embrace the idea of healing and
deliverance, demonic attacks and possession can be dealt with” (1970, p 13) 2.3 frequencies
of the 50 respondents which is 4.6% strongly disagree, 2.2 frequencies of 4.4% disagree with
the statement, while 2.5 frequencies of 5% of the respondents were undecided on the
statement as shown in the table below.

CHAPTER FIVE
THEOLOGICAL ANALYSIS
5.1 Introduction
The number of specific healings recorded in the Old Testament bears no comparison with
those recorded in the Gospels and Acts. In fact there are only twelve recorded in the four
millennia of Old Testament history, far less than Jesus sometimes did in a single day!
5.2 Healing and Deliverance in the Old Testament
Healing is part of the great plethora of divine activities recorded between Genesis and
Malachi. Each of Israel’s historical eras is peppered with angelic visitations, divine
revelations, anthropomorphic appearances, acts of judgment, supernatural manifestations and
miraculous deliverances which are purposefully recorded as evidence of God’s interaction
with mankind, but especially his people, Israel. These miraculous occurrences provided Israel
with confidence in their leaders and in the Scriptures that recorded their stories. How else
would they have accepted Moses’ ministry and message without witnessing the signs that
accompanied him? Moses rod that became a serpent, the plagues of Egypt, the death of the
first-born, the pillar of cloud, the pillar of fire and a host of other spectacular manifestations
underscored the fact that God was actively involved with his people and that Moses was his
messenger.
The same could be said of the rest of the Old Testament with its interweaving of prophetic
activity and real-time events. God’s way has always been to endorse his men and their
message by signs and wonders that men might believe.
There are two main periods when such activities abounded in Old Testament times. The first
was during the time of Moses and the second during the consecutive ministries of Elijah and
Elisha. Far more supernatural events were recorded in each of these two eras than in the rest
of the Old Testament added together. Though God was always at work in the world and
amongst His people, there were special times when his activity was intensified and
observable phenomenon flourished. They may be described as ‘times of refreshing from the
Lord.’ (Acts 3:19)


There are specific Healings recorded in the Old Testament for instance, Genesis 20:1-18
‘Then Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech, his wife and his slave girls so
they could have children again, for the Lord had closed up every womb in Abimelech's
household because of Abraham's wife Sarah.’ Gen 20:17-18. Numbers 12:1-15 God inflicted
Miriam with leprosy and Moses interceded for her saying, ‘O God, please heal her!’ Though
there is no record of her healing it must be assumed that the Lord exchanged this act of
judgment with the lesser penalty of seven days of disgrace outside the camp. There is no
further mention of her having leprosy. 1 Samuel 1:9-20 Hannah received healing from
barrenness in response to her personal prayers and Eli, the priest’s declaration.1 Kings 13:4-6
King Jeroboam pointed his hand in judgment at an unnamed prophet and it ‘shriveled up.’
The prophet interceded for Jeroboam and his hand was restored to health. 1 Kings 17:17-24
Elijah raised a widow’s son from death. 2 Kings 4:8-17 Elisha granted a child to the formerly
barren Shunnamite woman.
Also, in 2 Kings 4:18-37 The Shunamite’s son dies and Elisha raised him from the dead. 2
Kings 5:1-14 Naaman, commander of the King of Aram’s army, was healed of leprosy after
following Elisha’s counsel. 2 Kings 13:21 A dead man was thrown into Elisha’s tomb and
contact with Elisha’s bones raised the man to life. Daniel 4:34, 36 Nebuchadnezzar ‘looked
to heaven’ and was healed of insanity.
5.3 Healing and Deliverance in the New Testament
In the New Testament, Jesus commissioned others to heal too. For instance, Matthew 10:1
“And when He had called His twelve disciples to Him, He gave them power over unclean
spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all kinds of sickness and all kinds of disease. The healing
scriptures show that healing was not limited to coming from Jesus alone.
There are also some promises of the New Testament for Healing for example, James 5:14-15
says, “If any of you are sick, they should call for the elders of the church, and the elders
should pray over them, anointing them with oil in the name of the Lord. Prayer that comes
from faith will heal the sick, for the Lord will restore them to health. And if they have sinned,
they will be forgiven.”


5.4 Healing and Deliverance in Church History
As the gospels prominently document, healing is a primary feature of Christ's ministry.
Francis MacNutt writes, —Just as the early church kept a lively practice of the baptism in the
Spirit, they also carried on Jesus' healing and deliverance ministries.
5.5 Healing and Deliverance in the Contemporary Church
Today, we recognize that there are situations and conditions where medical help may not be
available or may be unable to help someone. We need to help people receive their healing
and deliverance through the supernatural power of God. There may be times where although
medical remedies are available, we minister healing and deliverance through the supernatural
power of God to demonstrate God’s love, power, and reality.
Here are a few biblical reasons why we must minister supernatural healing and deliverance
today:
Miracles, healing, and deliverance reveal the reality and nature of God. Miracles reveal God’s
greatness. Miracles demonstrate God’s compassion. Miracles have a powerful effect on
people, especially on those who do not believe. The importance Jesus gave to miracles. The
Kingdom comes with power. The Gospel is to be preached with accompanying signs.
Miracles encourage people to believe for more of the supernatural.









CHAPTER SIX
SUMMARY OF FINDINGS, CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.1 Introduction
The study relied on a sample and actual population of 50 respondents who participated fully
in the study. Therefore, this chapter addresses the summaries of findings, conclusions, and
recommendations in relation to the study objectives, and will state areas for further research
as illustrated below;
6.2 Summary of Findings
The research largely relied on both male and female respondents during the study. Majority
of the respondents were male 60% compared to female respondents 40%. In terms of age
category, it was found out that respondents between the above 55 years were the biggest
number 34% followed by the ages 50-54 years 20%. In terms of education background, it was
found out those respondents who has certificate of education with 50% were the majority
compared to Diploma holder 35% and then respondents who are degree and other
qualifications 5%. Majority of the respondents were Christians/Church who have served in
church committee for more than 5 with 50%, while 3-4 years in service were 30% and lastly
those less than 3 years were minority with 20% of the respondents.
Regarding the practice of healing and deliverance ministry in the Church, 60% of the
respondents strongly agreed that healing and deliverance existed and 40% disagreed with the
idea. About those who carry out the Ministry of healing and deliverance as majority 51% of
the respondents revealed that, the intercessors, others were 23% parish priests and 17% youth
pastors. It was also reported on how the Ministry of healing and deliverance was carried out
and 44.7%, of the respondents said through fellowships, 34% prayers and 14.9% deliverance
service. It was reported that the Ministry of healing and deliverance was carried out every
end of the week with 27.6% some reported mid-week with 23.4% and twice a month 14.9%.
About what happened to people after experiencing healing and deliverance 40.4% of the
respondents had led a transformed life, 27.7% improved spirituality and 14.9% lived a
prayerful life of change.
Regarding challenges facing Ministry of healing and deliverance in the Church, 29.7%, of
respondents said lack of Biblical knowledge about the word of God for healing and


deliverance, 21.3% divisionism of believers in the Church, and 42.6% reported lack of
theological training in equipping believers. It was also reported about when the challenges
begun to manifest in the Church and 38.3%, of the respondents said failing to attend Bible
studies conducted 21.3%, deterioration in faith of God and His powers of healing, 19.2%
abandonment of Church services. Most members of the Church who were highly affected
included 36.2% coverts into Christianity 25.5% children and 17.1% elders in the Church.
Lastly, there was a question relating to what strategies put in place to minimize the challenges
facing the Ministry of healing and deliverance in the Church. 36% of the respondent believed
that, there is need to teach people to have passion for Ministry of healing and deliverance to
preach the gospel, 28% encouraged carrying out Bible studies to equip believers with the
word of God, and also encouraging believers to repent of their sins, through praying, fasting
using the Prayer Book to get proper guidance on praying and preaching.
6.3 Conclusion
In this chapter, the study examined some major concepts relevant to this research. Among
them are ill health, healing, deliverance and church growth. From the discussions, it has
become obvious that several challenges account for lack of healing and deliverance ministry
in the Church. Both physical and spiritual aspects have been identified as two major
challenges of lack of Biblical knowledge about the word of God and divisionism including
lack of theological training. The chapter also examined the concept of healing and some of
the approaches that are adopted by different religions in the society to achieve it. It has
become clear from the discussions that one major requirement for holistic and total healing
and deliverance to discover the challenges facing the ministry of healing and deliverance in
the Anglican Church so as to identify and apply the most appropriate healing methods using
the right strategies.
Chapter two expounded the practice of healing and deliverance in Church ministry,
challenges, and strategies to minimize such challenges for effective church growth and the
various dimensions from which it can be understood. Chapter three focused on the
methodological approach utilizing a qualitative approach, drawing on narratives and stories
and seeking to answer the how and why questions, in addition to the question. Chapter four
looked at analysis part of it and chapter five concluded the study. However, regarding the
strategies to minimize the challenges facing the ministry of healing and deliverance,
respondents suggested the need to teach people the passion for ministry work to preach the


gospel as healing is part and parcel of the gospel. Others suggested the need to carryout
Biblical studies to equip believers with the word of God.
6. 4 Recommendations
The study recommends the following to be put into consideration, equipping church ministers
and healing programs in the Church;
Ministry to the sick and troubled is an essential part of the Church’s ministry. This ministry
is one of prayer and sacrament, word and care. Healing and deliverance ministry in the
Church should ‘hold up the weak, heal the sick, bind up the broken’ (Prayer Book
Consecration Service). This in the ministry should symbolize in the blessing of oil for
anointing the sick during Holy Week.
Much attention should be drawn in the forms of prayer and guidelines found in the Common
Worship Pastoral Services, in the section called Wholeness and Healing. These, (together
with the form in Common Worship itself, called Thanksgiving for the Healing Ministry of the
Church), suggest that laity may be invited to share in prayer ministry and laying on of hands.
The Diocesan Group for the Ministry of Healing should provide support and advice relating
to Christ’s reconciling ministry of healing and deliverance to believers. The Group
recommends and endorses the code of conduct found in A Time to Heal Handbook and the
guidance from the House of Bishops in equipping and mentoring believers for deliverance
ministry.
Deliverance Ministry should be seen as part of the wider healing and pastoral ministry of the
church. To help discern what sort of ministry is needed, and to avoid the problems of
misdiagnosis and inappropriate ministry the advice of the Bishop’s Adviser for Healing and
Deliverance Ministry should be sought.

The Diocesan Deliverance Team (DDT) should aim at providing timely information, advice
and support to Clergy. For example, they work in partnership with clergy to offer healing and
deliverance ministry to people in need. This may include responding to clergy enquiries about
persons suffering from spiritual oppression, poltergeists and apparitions, previous spiritually
abusive ministries, involvement with the occult, or reports of paranormal activity.
Healing, reconciliation and restoration are integral to the good news of Jesus Christ. For this
reason prayer for individuals, should focus through laying on of hands or anointing with oil,
has a proper place within the public prayer of the Church. God’s gracious activity of healing


should be part of the proclaiming of the good news and as an outworking of the presence of
the Spirit in the life of the Church.
There is need for prayers in the Anglican Church to be sensitive to a number of
simplifications or misunderstandings. It should not imply a simple link between sickness and
sin; Jesus himself warned against the direct association of disability and sin (John 9.3).
However, prayer for healing and strengthening should not involve the rejection of the skills
and activity of medicine which are also part of God’s faithfulness to creation (Ecclesiastes
38.9-12; Psalm 147.3).
There is an urgent need for spiritual empowerment training in all dioceses in Uganda. This
would help to transform the prayers of all Anglican priests. The prayer should be something
like this:

“In the Name of Jesus Christ, with the authority given to me as a Christian, I bind all
enemies of Christ from operating in life (Luke 10:18-19). So Christians should receive
the Holy Spirit in the Name of Jesus Christ and by the power of His cross and blood.
Come, Lord Jesus, and surround us with the power of Your Holy Spirit. Give us your
direction, Lord, on how to proceed. Amen.”

There is need to raise up more ministers to bring the Gospel’s message of freedom to those
suffering from demonic attacks, and raising awareness of the need for this important ministry.
Practically speaking, this means pastors recruiting and training deliverance teams in their
parishes and bishops appointing resource people to help pastors in this ministry. Lastly,
deliverance ministry seeks to help those who are encountering unusual and/or troubling
experiences that might be considered paranormal; or who feel afraid, oppressed or possessed
by evil and to bring hope and the deliverance to those in captives (Luke 4:18-19).
6.5 Areas for further research
For further studies, the following areas for research are suggested;
1) The concepts of healing and deliverance and church growth in the dioceses of Lango.
2) The relationship between healing and deliverance and church growth in Anglican
Church.
3) The significance of spiritual healing and deliverance in the church ministry in
Uganda.
