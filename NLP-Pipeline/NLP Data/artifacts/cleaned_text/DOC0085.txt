ABSTRACT

Yogurt is one of the most widely consumed fermented dairy products due to its
various nutritional benefits, especially its protein content and probiotic activity.
One of the most commonly consumed yogurt types is flavored yogurt and fruit yogurt
which involve use of a refined sugar and as a sweetener and yet over the recent
decade, consumer preferences have been seen to shift from taste or flavor being
the main drive to use of natural ingredients and additives such as flavorants, nutrient
content and environmental impact as priorities. This research was focused on the
use of soursop pulp as a natural sweetener in total replacement of refined sugar
during yogurt production and also use of lime juice as a natural flavorant. Three
batches were prepared and three treatments randomly assigned for each batch. To
batch 1, soursop pulp containing 2% lime juice was added to the yogurt(T1), to batch
2, only soursop pulp was added to the yogurt (0% lime juice) which acted as the
control and to the third batch, 3% lime juice was added to the yogurt. Chemical
qualities of the yogurt such as fat, carbohydrate, protein, fibre and Vitamin C
content of the soursop pulp- lime yogurt was determined and they were compared
against the same nutritional attributes of conventional strawberry fruit yogurt. A
one sample t test was carried out to compare the results. The results revealed that
significant differences (p<0.001) in protein, fat, total carbohydrate, total fibre and
vitamin C content between the soursop pulp-lime yogurt and strawberry fruit yogurt
used for comparison. The soursop pulp-lime yogurt exhibited slightly higher protein,
fat and fibre content. There was significant decrease in the carbohydrate content
and increase in the Vitamin C content as well. Consumer acceptability testing was
also carried out and the results revealed that colour scores were highest for 3% lime
juice, aroma scores were highest for 2% lime juice and consistency scores highest in
3% lime juice. Mouthfeel scores decreased slightly with an increase in lime juice.
The overall taste was rated highest for 2% lime juice.

CHAPTER ONE
1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background of study
Fermented drinks and food, particularly yogurt, have been largely consumed over
centuries due to their flavor and nutritional benefits, such as high protein content,
treatment of lactose intolerance. They are rich in minerals such as calcium, which
is essential in bone structure, and potassium (Katia Sivieri et al, 2017)
Yogurt is one of the most popular dairy products globally, with major consumers in
countries such as France, the United States of America, China, the Netherlands,
Turkey, and India. China, for example, has an average per capita consumption of
about 5kg per consumer annually. The yogurt market is particularly big in North
America and Europe. According to World Integrated Trade Solution (WITS) data for
2023, Germany led exports with about $780.5 million, followed by the European
Union collectively at $523.4 million, Greece at $351.4 million, France at $348.7
million, and Spain at $170.6 million (World Integrated Trade Solution, 2023).
Yogurt is made using specific bacteria known as yogurt cultures, which are primarily
Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus. Strains such as
Lactobacillus delbrueckii and Streptococcus salivarius can be added to improve the
probiotic content of the yogurt. Probiotics are harmless, live and active
microorganisms ingested to alter the gastrointestinal flora for health benefits. These
ferment lactose to lactic acid, giving yogurt its texture and tang. Yogurt is
considered a probiotic product offering several health benefits, such as improved
lactose digestion, but also easy digestion in general since it's easier for the body to
absorb its nutrients, offers strengthening of the immune system, and reduces risks
of type 2 diabetes and gut disorders (Nahed L Zaki et al, 2021). Yogurt is rich in highquality proteins, carbohydrates, calcium, phosphorus, potassium, and vitamins B6
and B12. Various yogurt types include plain, Greek, frozen, fruit, and flavoredsweetened yogurt. However, over the past decade, studies have shown that
consumer preferences for food products have shifted from taste and flavor as the
main drive towards nutrient content, natural additives and sweeteners, and



environmentally friendly food products or ingredients being prioritized (Jovana
Dzoljic et al., 2018). This trend shows that consumers have become more health
conscious. Soursop fruit, Annona muricata, which is known for its sweetness (Makebe
Calister Wingang, 2021), and lime (Citrus aurantifolia), valued for its tanginess, are
potential natural alternatives for sweetening and flavoring yogurt. Furthermore,
soursop has high nutritional content while lime, is also a rich source of vitamin C
and other antioxidants that are essential in the elimination of free radicals from the
human body (Kamelia Ramadaini et al, 2020). Both fruits are currently underutilized
in the country due to a lack of knowledge of their nutritional and economic benefits.
Previous studies have shown that soursop puree or pulp, when added to yogurt,
improved on the functional, sensory, and nutritional properties of yogurt (Senadeera
et al, 2018) and also contributed to an increase in vitamin C content of the yogurt
(Saputrayadi et al,2021). Further studies have also shown that the soursop puree or
pulp was added to yogurt during its manufacture, mainly to improve the flavor of
the yogurt. Soursop pulp was also added in partial substitution of refined sugars such
as sucrose. (Mayowa Saheed Sanusi et al, 2023). Lime has been added to fruit juices
in previous studies to improve the microbial quality of the fruit juices to increase
their shelf life due to its anti-microbial and anti-oxidant properties. (Micheal
Okpara, 2013). However, there is limited information on the use of soursop pulp as
a sweetener in full substitution of refined sugar during yogurt manufacture, and no
substantial studies have been carried out on the use of lime juice as a flavorant in
yogurt. There is also a need to further explore the interactive effect of lime juice
and soursop pulp on the nutrient composition and consumer acceptability of yogurt.
The above information will highlight the potential of soursop pulp as a natural
sweetener and lime juice as a natural and unique flavorant in yogurt, and therefore
contribute to the development of healthier dairy products that align with the
changing consumer preferences. The findings of this research will also provide
valuable insights for food manufacturers seeking natural alternatives to refined
sugars and innovative flavor profiles.




1.2 Problem statement
The global shift in consumer preferences has posed a challenge to the acceptability
of food products on the market by emphasizing a demand for natural ingredients,
improved nutrition profiles, and reduced reliance on refined sugars and synthetic
additives. Soursop fruit (Annona muricata), a tropical fruit known for its natural
sweetness and rich nutrient content, offers potential as a substitute for refined
sugar in yogurt production. However, its complete substitution for refined sugar
remains underexplored, particularly regarding its ability to maintain sweetness
levels while providing additional health benefits without compromising the
fermentation process or sensory attributes of yogurt.
Similarly, lime juice, a natural flavorant with a good consumer appeal due its antibacterial, anti-oxidant and tangy properties, poses challenges in yogurt
manufacturing due to its high acidic nature which risks curdling and formation of a
bitter taste that affect product consistency and taste. Consequently, the feasibility
of its use as a flavorant in yogurt remains unknown.
1.3 Purpose of the study
This research aims to address these gaps by determining the feasibility of using
soursop as a full replacement for refined sugar in yogurt production and assessing
lime juice as a natural flavorant without compromising yogurt texture, stability, and
taste. This study seeks to develop innovative yogurt formulations that cater for
health-conscious consumers, increasing utilization of soursop fruit and lime in the
food and beverage industry through yogurt production; while ensuring maintenance
of sensory attributes and product integrity during storage.
1.4 Objectives of the study
1.4.1 Main objective
To produce a sugar-free yogurt by fully substituting refined sugar with soursop pulp
as a natural sweetener and incorporating lime juice as a natural flavorant, while
assessing their combined impact on the nutritional, sensory, and physicochemical
properties of the yogurt.



1.4.2 Specific objectives
1. To determine the vitamin C, protein, carbohydrate, fat, and fibre content of
soursop pulp-lime yogurt and compare it with that of conventional fruit yogurt.
2. To determine the consumer acceptability of soursop pulp yogurt and soursop
pulp-lime yogurt.
1.5 Hypothesis
1. There is no difference in the vitamin C, protein, carbohydrate, fat and fibre
content of soursop pulp-lime yogurt and that of conventional fruit yogurt.
2. There is no difference in the consumer acceptability of soursop pulp yogurt and
soursop pulp-lime yogurt.
1.6 Significance of Study
This research was of great benefit to the food industry through creation of a
functional yogurt that addresses consumer preferences and demand for natural and
nutritive food options. The use of soursop pulp and lime juice as natural substitutes
for refined sugar and artificial flavourings provided yogurt and non-sweetened
yogurt consumers due to health concerns a healthier alternative which was sugarfree yogurt of similar taste as that of sweetened yogurt but with a unique flavor
profile. Simultaneously, this study paved way for increased utilization of soursop and
lime fruits fostering market growth for local producers in Uganda therefore
increasing on income sources and diversity in agricultural communities.

1.8 Scope of the study
This research covered the following areas; experimental production of sweetened
sugar-free yogurt, utilizing soursop pulp as a natural sweetener and lime juice as a
natural flavorant, determination of recipes involving varying quantities of lime juice
that did not affect the fermentation process but still achieved the desired
consistency and stability of the yogurt. The first key component of this research was
the determination of vitamin C, protein, carbohydrate, fat and fibre content of the
produced soursop-lime yogurt. This was followed by comparing it with the
composition of the same nutrient attributes of conventional fruit yogurt. The
purpose of this exercise was to demonstrate nutritional advantages or otherwise,
since conventional fruit yogurt has almost similar nutritional properties like those of
soursop pulp-lime yogurt especially in aspects of vitamin C and fibre as opposed to
ordinary sweetened yogurt. Furthermore, the study assessed the consumer
acceptability of soursop pulp yogurt without lime juice and soursop pulp yogurt to
which different concentrations of lime had been added through sensory evaluation
using an untrained panel to gauge overall yogurt preference of the consumers.
1.9 Limitations of the study
The use of a fixed 1:1 replacement ratio of the soursop for sugar may not identify
the optimal concentration for sweetness, flavor and overall quality of the yogurt.
Varying concentrations could potentially yield better sensory and nutritional results.
The comprehensive nutrient analysis will be carried on only one soursop pulp-lime
yogurt treatment which leaves gaps in drawing definitive conclusions on the nutrient
content of the other treatments that will be made. The absence of a shelf-life study
makes it difficult to assess the long-term stability of the sensory attributes and
microbial quality and therefore safety of the soursop pulp-lime yogurt. Finally, the
Control variables

pasteurisation temperature,
maxigel, storage temperature




consumer acceptability results obtained in Uganda may not be directly applicable to
other regions with differing taste preferences and cultural backgrounds.
1.10 Organization of the study

up of the background of the study, statement of problem, objectives of study,
significance of study, scope of study, limitation of study and organization of study.
Chapter two contains the review of existing literature in relation to the topic of
study. Chapter three contains the methodology adopted for the study, chapter four

and recommendations.



















CHAPTER TWO
2.0 Literature Review
2.1 Overview of yogurt
The word fermentation came from a Latin word, fevere, which was later explained
by Louis Pasteur as “life without air”. It is scientifically defined as a metabolic
process that produces energy from organic compounds with or without the
involvement of exogenous agents such as microbial enzymes or microorganisms.
For a very long time, fermented drinks and foods contributed greatly to the human
diet in terms of their nutritional health benefits, and Yogurt has emerged as one of
the most consumed dairy fermented product on the market today (Andrzej
Blazejczyk,2023). It has one of the fastest growing markets with France, Turkey,
Netherlands, United States and China being some of the world’s biggest consumers
(C. Chandan, 2024, A. Shunekeyeva, M. Alimardanova et al., 2021) The largest
consumer is China with an average consumption of about 5kgs per person per year.
Geographically, North America is the major contributor to the yogurt market in
terms of value followed by Europe and this has been due to introduction of new
flavors that offer low fat benefits. In the Asian Pacific region, China dominates the
market followed by India with Japan showing continuous steady growth in the past
years.
The total export value of yogurt around the world in 2015 was more than 2 million
US dollars with about 1.5 million tons of yogurt being exported around the world.
Germany has been the leading exporter of yogurt for many years with a trade value
of more than 500,000 US dollars and 500,000 tons in 2015 which accounts for more
than 30% of the yogurt traded globally. (IDF, 2016). The bacteria used to make yogurt
are known as yogurt cultures and these cultures include Lactobacillus delbrueckii
subspecies bulgaricus and Streptococcus salivarius subspecies thermophilus
according to the CODEX standards (CODEX STAN 243-2003). In addition, others
like Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria are also sometimes added during or after
culturing the yogurt. Fermentation of lactose by these bacteria produces lactic acid,
which acts on milk protein to give yogurt its texture and characteristic tang. It is a
probiotic product since it contains live active microorganisms which upon ingestion



in sufficient number exert health benefits beyond the inherent basic nutrition
(CODEX STAN 243-2003). This benefit has increased the consumption of yogurt.

Figure 1: A picture of produced yogurt
2.2 Nutritional benefits of yogurt
Yogurt supplies good quality proteins, which are important in the synthesis of organic
molecules in the body that in order to maintain catabolic and anabolic processes in
the body. It is also an excellent source of carbohydrates, which are a source of
energy to the body. It is also important in the prevention of type 2 diabetes due to
its probiotic content, which improves insulin sensitivity (Koichiro Sumi et al).
Yogurt is also crucial in weight management, for it creates satiety, which reduces
overeating. Probiotics in yogurt enhance gut health by improving digestion and
alleviating conditions like irritable bowel syndrome and lactose intolerance by
breaking down the lactose. Yogurt helps to reduce cardio metabolic diseases by
lowering serum cholesterol levels. It is also rich in calcium, vitamin D, which support
bone density and reduce the risk of osteoporosis (Christopher J Cifelli et al, 2020).
The probiotics in the yogurt have immune-modulatory effects that boost the body’s
defense mechanism. Yogurt also controls infections by inhibiting the growth of
pathogenic organisms. Yogurt’s nutrients contribute to healthier skin by improving
hydration and reducing inflammation and bloating (Julie M Glanville et al, 2015).
The popular varieties of yogurt include;



Plain yogurt which is traditional yogurt without added flavors or sweeteners for
enhanced taste. It serves as a versatile base for dishes or snacks.
Fruit or flavored yogurt which contains added fruit, flavors or sweeteners for
enhanced taste. It is popular among children and those seeking a sweeter option.
This is one of most widely consumed type of yogurt.
Greek yogurt (strained yogurt) which is a thick and creamy yogurt due to straining
to remove whey. It has a higher protein content compared to normal yogurt.
Frozen yogurt which is a dessert alternative to ice cream, offering lower fat content
while retaining probiotics.
Soy yogurt, which is made from soy milk instead of dairy, is suitable for vegans or
individuals with lactose intolerance.
Yogurt beverages with often drinkable combined with fruit juices or other flavors
for convenience and refreshment.
Probiotic yogurt, which contains live bacterial cultures specifically added for their
health benefits, such as improving gut microbiota balance. (Katia Sivieri et al, 2017)
2.3 Soursop fruit description
2.3.1 Classification of soursop fruit
Soursop belongs to the Annonaceae family which is a family in the plant kingdom
with 50 genera and three of those are edible fruits (Annona, Rollinia, Asimina) with
the first two being of commercial importance. It generally consists of 390 species in
the tropical and subtropical areas world-wide (Pinto et al, 2017). A. Muricata is
classified as shown below;
Kingdom; Plantae
Division; Magnoliophyta (Angiosperms)
Class; Magnolids
Order; Magnoliales
Family; Annonaceae
Genus; Annona



Species; muricata
The soursop fruit is a fused-together berry that is dark green in colour with a spiky
or spiney surface (Patel and Patel, 2016) and associated flower parts. It is a heart
or oval-shaped fruit with about 5-200 seeds. (Blancke, 2016). The average weight of
a healthy soursop fruit is about 4kg, and it has a creamy coloured granular interior
with an edible, fibrous and juicy fleshy pulp which can easily be peeled away from
its core. The soursop fruits can be categorized into: acid, subacid, and sweet, or can
be grouped according to how their flesh is, i.e., wet, soft, stiff, and extremely dry
(Matsuda,2017)
Soursop fruit, botanically known as Annona muricata, locally known as “Ekitaferi”
in Uganda, is a delicious fruit widely grown in the tropics and subtropical regions of
the world, including South America, Africa, and Asia, with the largest being Mexico.


Figure 2 A picture of soursop fruit
2.4 Chemical composition of soursop fruit
The soursop fruit is made up of 20% skin, 67.5% edible pulp, 4% core, and 8.5% seeds
by weight. (Uchegbu et al, 2018). The white edible pulp contains 1% protein, 18%
carbohydrate, 3.43% titratable acidity, 80-81% water, 24.5% non-reducing sugar, and
vitamins B1, B2, and C. Furthermore, soursop is made up o 53.1-61.3 calories, 82.8g
moisture, 1 g protein, 0.97g of fat, 60 g of ash, 10.3mg of calcium, 0.79g of fibre
which makes up 0.78-0.95% of the pulp (Gavamukyala et al, 2017), 0.64mg of iron,
0.11mg thiamine, 29.6mg of vitamin C, 11mg tryptophan, methionine (7mg), 60g
lysine, sugars account between 67.2-69.9% of the total solids. (Princess Hannah,
2023). The fructose, D-glucose, and sucrose percentages in the soursop pulp were



1.80,2.27, and 6.57%, making the total sugar content 10.48%. It also contains 12%
sugar (Siqueira et al., 2015) with pectin making up the majority of the alcoholinsoluble solids, which are 4.0% by dry weight between pre-climacteric and
climacteric stages and 0.91% by fresh weight from pre-climacteric stages. The pH of
the pulp is 4.56, soluble solids concentration is 1510 for the pulp. (Princess Hannah,
2023)

2.5 Post-harvest challenges and proper handling of soursop.
Preliminary analyses have indicated a substantial loss of 75.8% for tropical fruits like
soursop. This loss is accelerated by poor field farmer practices and growers’ lack of
knowledge and understanding of factors affecting fruit quality. In Uganda, soursop
has low production due to its low demand and high pre-harvest and post-harvest
losses caused by the fruit borer, leading to 30% loss and 54% total pulp yield
(Kankwatsa et al., 2017). This has led to scattered production by only willing
individual farmers in the country. Soursop fruits are usually harvested when they
are fully developed and still a bit firm and yellow-green (physiological maturity)
(Badrie & Schauss, 2010) or else they will fall and be crushed if allowed to
deteriorate on the tree. Ripe soursop fruits are highly delicate and prone to bruising
which shortens their post-harvest life and that is why ripening at room temperature
is recommended as young fruits do not fully develop aroma and flavor when ripened
off the tree. Soursop fruits are highly sensitive to cold temperatures with chilling
injuries causing skin darkening, inability to ripen, pulp discoloration, poor flavor and
aroma and increased rot (de Lima and Alves, 2011).
To prevent spoilage and reduce deterioration of soursop fruit, the soursop fruit is
pulp and the pulp pasteurized at 790C for 69 seconds to preserve nutrients,
inactivate spoilage enzymes and reduce microbial load and is then refrigerated at
temperatures between 40C (Jerry Ampofo-Asiama et al., 2018) to increase its shelf
life from 5 days to 12 weeks. One of the other significant challenges faced with
soursop fruit is that it has a short harvest season and so cultivators that have various
maturity durations have been created in effort to balance the market supply (Badrie
& Schauss, 2010) and has low production majorly due to its very low demand and
high pre-harvest and post-harvest losses due to its perishability. It has a whitish



edible pulp that contains water, titratable acidity, carbohydrate, protein and nonreducing sugar of 80,3.43,18,1 and 24.5% respectively. (Badrie & Schauss 2010).
Soursop fruit currently is mainly consumed as a fruit, juice or packed purees
worldwide. Previous research in the last decade has shown that soursop fruit is rich
in flavours especially in sweetening flavours i.e., rich in sugars, has a high nutritional
profile i.e., contains vitamins, minerals, proteins, flavonoids, phenolic compounds
with
antidiabetic,
antihypertensive,
anticarcinogenic,
antiobesity,
antihypercholesterolemic, hypoglycemic and antibacterial properties. In addition,
the pulp is rich in soluble fibres especially hydrolysed pectin (pectin oligosaccharides
that are prebiotics and therefore are a source of food to probiotics in the gut
especially the colon and maintain its health. (Mbaeyi-Nwaoha, Ekere K.S) It also has
a high protein content and has been used in countries like Nigeria and Benin to treat
protein deficiencies. (Rene G Degnon et al). Previous studies have shown that
soursop puree or pulp, when added to yogurt, improved the functional, sensory, and
nutritional properties of yogurt (Senadeera et al, 2018) and also contributed to an
increase in vitamin C content of the yogurt (Saputrayadi et al,2021). Further studies
have also shown that the soursop puree or pulp was added to yogurt during its
manufacture, mainly to improve the flavor of the yogurt in addition to refined sugar
such as sucrose or in partial substitution of refined sugars with the soursop pulp.
(Mayowa Saheed Sanusi et al, 2023).
2.6 Overview of lime fruit
Lime is a fruit botanically known as Citrus aurantifolia and locally known as “Enimu”
is a citrus fruit known for its tangy-bitter taste, which is a common attribute of the
citrus family of fruits. It is also known as orange pecel. Lime trees can reach 3-6
meters high, are branched and thorny with small oval leaves that have a winged
petiole. The axillary leaves are where an inflorescence emerges to give small white
fragrant flowers. The fruit is ovate or round-shaped and it has a green-yellow colour
with thin skin that is rich in essential oils. The inside flesh of the fruit is greenish
white and is rich in vitamin C, with many small and polyembryonic. They grow well
in alkaline soils; places exposed to direct sunlight. Propagation of the fruit is by seed
or grafting. The fruit is used to make drinks, cough medicine, and food flavoring.
(Zikra Azizal., 2020) It is rich in phytochemical compounds such as alkaloids,



flavonoids (apigenin, rutin, quercetin, kaempferol, hesperidin), triterpenoids,
saponins, tannins, phenolics, and vitamin C. (Kamelia Ramadaini et al., 2020)

Figure 3 A picture of lime fruit
2.7 Nutritional benefits of lime fruit
Lime’s health benefits are mainly due to its phytochemical compounds. These health
benefits include: (Kamelia Ramadaini et al., 2020)
Lime has anticarcinogenic effects where it stops the mobility of cancer cells, inhibits
metastasis and angiogenesis, and induces tumor suppressor genes and apoptosis.
Lime peel extract has been used to help heal traumatic ulcers due to its antiinflammatory properties and also inhibits bacterial growth and therefore is
commonly used as a preservative.
Lime peel extract can help heal traumatic ulcers due to its anti-inflammatory
properties.
Lime also aids in digestion due its acidity that provides an ideal environment for the
action of stomach enzymes like pepsin, gastric amylase and lipase. (W. Abobatta et
al, 2019).
The tangy taste from lime is important to balance the sweetness of the yogurt
creating a uniform and balance flavor. (Rati Jani et al, 2024).
2.8 Changes in consumer preferences for food products
The factors driving consumer acceptability of food products are undergoing
significant changes. Historically, taste and flavor were primary considerations, but
recent trends indicate a shift towards nutritional benefits, the use of natural
additives and natural sweeteners, particularly moving away from refined sugar.
Consumers increasingly prefer products with fewer synthetic chemicals and more



natural ingredients such as stevia, which is a natural, intense sweetener used in
various food categories like snacks and beverages (Jovana Dzoljic et al., 2018).
This shift is driven by health concerns such as obesity and chronic diseases linked to
high sugar intake (N. Caglarirmak et al., 2021). Additionally, innovations in food
technology like the development of functional gummy candies with natural
sweeteners and antioxidants reflect this consumer preference for healthier options
(Mohammad Tarahi et al.,2024). The dairy industry also sees a move towards clean
label products, emphasizing natural ingredients over synthetic additives (Ume
Roobab et al., 2021)





















CHAPTER THREE
3.0 METHODOLOGY
3.1 MATERIALS AND METHODS
3.1 Introduction
This chapter contains materials, the method of carrying out the research, analysis
of variables in the research, and what was used to interpret the results of the
research.
3.2 Study location
The product preparation and sensory evaluation were carried out in the Food Science
and Technology laboratory at Uganda Christian University, Mukono while the
proximate analysis was carried out at Uganda Industrial Research Institute in
Nakawa, Kampala, Uganda.
3.3 Sources of Information
Primary Data: this was derived from laboratory measurements of vitamin C, fat,
carbohydrates, protein and fibre content and sensory evaluations from untrained
habitual yoghurt consuming panelists for consumer acceptability.
Secondary Data: this included all material that informed the standard procedures
of the analyses, the measurements to be used, procedures for carrying out the
consumer acceptability test and explanations of the results obtained. This included
literature on standard procedure on yogurt manufacture, laboratory testing manuals
and articles on properties and effects of both soursop and lime on the sensory
properties of different products.
3.4 Population and Sampling Techniques
The population of study consisted of three yoghurt batches prepared with 2% lime
juice, 0%lime juice and 3% lime juice respectively. Conventional strawberry fruit
yogurt was used for the comparative analysis because fruit yogurt in comparison to
other types of yogurts has similar nutritional properties as those of soursop pulplime yogurt especially vitamin C and fibre in particular (since it contains fruits),
which are absent in other yogurt types. Soursop pulp yogurt containing 3% lime juice
was used for comparative analysis with conventional fruit yogurt since it had the
highest amount of lime juice. The population of interest for consumer acceptability
tests consisted of a panel of untrained habitual yoghurt consumers. 41 samples from
each yogurt batch were randomly obtained from yogurt batches for consumer



acceptability because according to written literature, a range of 30-50 panelists is
required if sensory evaluation for consumer acceptability is being carried out using
an untrained panel and no replication will be required since preference tests will be
carried out.
3.5 Measurement levels
Nominal; hedonic scale (1-9) representing the level of like and dislike (extremely
dislike to extremely like)
Percentage of total weight; lime juice concentration, soursop pulp
Macro nutrients (fat, protein, carbohydrates, fibre); g
Micro nutrients (Vitamin C); mg
3.6 Materials and source
The materials for the research included ingredients for making the yogurt, such as
Maxigel, ripened soursop fruits, fresh lime, UHT milk, and yogurt culture. Additional
materials included table spoons, a stirrer (stainless steel), saucepans and a food
temperature digital thermometer. The fresh lime was sourced from Sombe market,
Mukono and the soursop fruit from Nakasero market, Kampala, and Sombe market,
Mukono in Uganda.
3.7 Yogurt preparation
Six litres of milk were used to make 3 batches of the yogurt where each batch was
made from 2 litres of milk. For each batch, the milk was pasteurized at a
temperature of 800C for 5 minutes with constant stirring. The milk was left to cool
to a temperature of 43-450C in a water bath. 5g of maxigel were first dissolved in a
small amount of milk and added to the rest of the milk and the mixture stirred for
even mixing. 10g of the yogurt culture were mixed a 3 table spoons of milk and then
inoculated into the milk. The yogurt was left to ferment for a period of 8 hours
where it reached until it reached a pH of 4.6.(Mbaeyi-Nwaoha et al, 2014)
3.8 Pulp extraction process
The soursop fruits were bought abit stiff and left to ripen fully for 2 days at room
temperature on a shelf because ripening in the refrigerator would cause rotting due
to chilling injuries and ripening allows full development of the flavor and aroma
characteristics (Rene G Degnon et al, 2013). After ripening, the soft soursop fruit



was washed using running tap water and rinsed with warm water to further soften
the skin. Gloves were worn and the fruit skin was gently peeled and separated from
the white fleshy pulp. The seeds were then separated from the fleshy pulp and the
pulp was blended for 20 minutes in a series of 5 minutes to prevent the blender from
overheating. The smooth blend was then transferred to a saucepan where it was
pasteurised at a temperature of 750C for 5 minutes in order to inactivate the spoilage
enzymes, kill microorganisms but also maintain the nutrient composition of the
soursop pulp since higher temperatures lead to reduction in the antioxidant and
titratable acidity of the soursop pulp (Mbaeyi-Nwaoha et al, 2014). The pulp was left
to cool in an airtight container until room temperature. 272g were measured off to
be added to each batch.

3.9 Lime juice extraction
The limes were washed in running water and scrubbed gently with a soft food brush
and rinsed water containing 2% hypochloric acid to sanitize the fruits. The fruits
were then dried and cut with a knife transversely for easy squeezing out of the juice.
The juice was squeezed out through a thin mesh sieve to separate the juice from
the seeds and any fruit flesh that may have come off the peel. 2% and 3% of the total
weight of the milk mixture was measured and added to the soursop pulp of the
batches where 2% and 3% lime were the treatments in its last minute of
pasteurization and mixed with the pulp before it was removed off the heat source
to be cooled.
3.10 Adding the soursop pulp mixture
To the first batch of yogurt, a mixture of 272g of soursop pulp and 2% lime juice
were added, and the batch was labelled “Sample 1; 2% lime juice. To the second
batch, only soursop pulp was added to the yogurt and the batch was labelled
“Sample 2; 0% lime juice”. To the third batch, a mixture of soursop pulp and 3% lime



juice were added to the yogurt and the batch was labelled “Sample 3; 3% lime
juice”. The yogurt and the soursop pulps were evenly mixed for a smooth
consistency. The different yogurt batches were then stored at 40C and this was one
according to the method by Naheed L. Zaki et al, 2021.
3.11 Experimental Design
In my study, I used a Completely Randomized Design (CRD) since I was varying only
one factor (Abdullah et al, 2020) and my treatments consisted of three levels of lime
juice concentration %(control), 2% and 3%. Three batches of yogurt were divided
into three experimental units, one for each treatment level and were randomly
assigned to the three treatments (0%,2%, and 3% lime juice concentrations) without
replication. This ensured that any differences observed between batches were due
to the treatments rather than other factors i.e., each batch received was exposed
to either 0%,2% or 3% lime juice concentration. (citation). The independent variable
in this study was the lime juice concentration and the dependent variables were
physicochemical parameters such as protein, fat, vitamin C, carbohydrate and fat
content. The other dependent variables were sensory attributes such as taste,
colour, consistency, overall taste, aroma, overall acceptability, mouthfeel, tangy
taste.

3.12 Data Collection and Protocol
3.12.1 Determination of chemical properties of soursop pulp- lime yogurt
The analysis was carried out at the Uganda Industrial Research Institute in Nakawa,
Uganda, in triplicate using the methods below.
3.12.2 Determination of ash content in Yogurts
Equipment and materials(specified);



• Muffle furnace
• Desiccator
• Crucibles
Apparatus preparation
The ceramic crucibles were cleaned using hydrochloric acid 1:1 solution, rinsed with
distilled water and dried in a muffle furnace at 550oC for one hour. The muffle
furnace was turned off and left to cool to 250oC. Tongs were then used to transfer
the crucibles to the desiccator and allowed to cool prior weighing. After 30 minutes,
the crucibles were removed and weighed and the readings taken (UIRI Analytical
Laboratories Quality Manual,2024)
10g of the sample were weighed into a tarred crucible which was placed in a cool
muffle furnace because the markings would be removed due to high temperatures
in the furnace. The muffle furnace was ignited for 4-6 hours, turned off after and
cooled to 250oC before the samples were removed. The sample was checked to
ensure that it was completely white with no black spots. The sample was relabeled
and transferred to the desiccator using tongs and covered to cool. After 30 minutes,
it was weighed and the readings taken.
Calculation
% Ash = G2-G1/W
Where, G2= Weight of crucible and sample after ashing
G1=Tare weight of crucible
W= Original sample weight



Quality control



A control sample was analyzed during each analysis and three replicates were run
for each sample analyzed.
3.12.4 Determination of Vitamin C Content
Preparation of reagents (UIRI Analytical Laboratories Quality Manual,2024)
1.Starch Indicator solution
0.50g of soluble starch were weighed, added to 50 near boiling distilled water and
mixed well before being cooled.
2.Iodine solution
5.00g of potassium iodide (KI) and 0.268g potassium iodate (KIO3) in 200ml distilled
water were dissolved and 30ml of sulphuric acid added. The solution was poured
into a 500ml graduated cylinder and diluted to 500ml with distilled water. The
solution was mixed and transferred to a 600ml beaker.
3.Vitamin C standard solution
0.250g of ascorbic acid were dissolved in 100ml distilled water and diluted up to
250ml in volumetric flask.
Standardizing solutions
25.00ml of vitamin C standard solution were added to a 125ml Erlenmeyer flask and
10 drops of 1% starch solution added. A burette was rinsed with a small volume of
the iodine solution and filled. The initial volume was recorded. The solution was
titrated until the end point was reached (a blue color that persisted after 20
seconds). The final volume of the iodide solution was recorded and the titration
repeated at least twice.
Vitamin C titration
25ml of the sample were added to a 125ml Erlenmeyer flask and the sample was
titrated exactly the same way as the standard and the initial and final recordings
were taken.
Calculations
Moles of vitamin C= Moles of iodine X stoichiometric ratio



Mass in mg= number of moles X molar mass X 1000

3.12.5 Determination of fat content
The fat content of a sample was determined using the Soxhlet extraction method. A
50 g sample, remaining after moisture determination, was weighed and placed in a
thimble. The thimble was then positioned in a Soxhlet extractor, and 300 mL of
petroleum ether was added until some of it overflowed into the flask. The flask was
heated on a water bath for approximately 8 hours to ensure complete extraction of
the oil from the sample. After extraction, the oil dissolved in the solvent was
separated by distillation, and any remaining solvent traces were removed by placing
the contents in an oven at 100°C for 30 minutes until a constant weight was
achieved. The fat content of the sample was calculated using the formula (Than
Than Cho et al,202):
Fat (%) =Weight of fat (g) X 100
Weight of sample (g)

3.12.6 Determination of Protein Content by Kjeldahl Method
Equipment and materials
• 40% NaOH
• Digesting unit
• Kjeldahl distillation unit
• Boric acid
• Sulphuric acid
An accurately weighed sample (ca 1.00 g) was placed in the Kjeldahl digestion tube
as described in the (UIRI Analytical Laboratories,2024). Kjeldahl catalyst, anhydrous
copper sulphate (8 g), pure sulphuric acid (50 mL), and some pieces of pumice stone
were added to the Kjeldahl digestion tube. Then it was shaken until the contents
were well mixed. The digestion tube with the sample was placed into the Bloc-digest
with the fume removed, operating. The digestion was done at a temperature of



150°C for 15 min, 300°C for 15 min, and 400°C for 1 hour. At the end of the process,
the green colour liquid was obtained. It was allowed to cool and transferred into the
conical flask. Distilled water (100 mL) was carefully added to the flask with frequent
shaking. The Kjeldahl distillation apparatus was set up, taking care that the tip of
the condenser extended well below the surface of the standard sulphuric acid
solution (50 mL) in the receiver. The digested solution was poured into the
distillation flask, and then 100 mL of 40 % sodium hydroxide solution was added to
it through the dropping funnel to make the mixture strongly alkaline. The evolved
ammonia was distilled off and passed into a receiver containing sulfuric acid. The
distillate, with respect to excess sulfuric acid, was then titrated with a standard
sodium hydroxide solution using methyl orange as an indicator. A blank
determination was carried out exactly as above, but instead of sample powder, 5
mL of distilled water was used;
Protein (%) = 0.014 x 100 x (X-V) NA X 6.75
w
Where,
x = volume (mL) of NaOH solution used in blank
v = volume (mL) of NaOH solution used in test
NA = Molarity of NaOH solution
w = Weight (g) of the sample
0.014 = Milliequivalent weight of the nitrogen
Quality control
A control sample was analyzed during each analysis, triplicates were also run during
each analysis and lastly a blank was run.

3.12.7 Determination of Crude Fibre Content
(UIRI Analytical Laboratories Quality Manual, 2024)
Reagents



• 98% concentrated to 1000ml with distilled water sulphuric acid (H2SO4)
• 12.5g of KOH to 1000ml with distilled water
• n-octanol as antifoam
• anhydrous acetone
• crucibles
The sample moisture was determined by heating in an oven at 105oC to constant
weight and cooled in desiccator. 1g of grinded sample was weighed and 1.25%
sulphuric acid added to it up to 150ml notch after preheating by the hot plate in
order to reduce the time for boiling. 3-5 drops of n-octanol as an antifoam agent
were added and boiled for 30 minutes. A vacuum was connected to drain the
sulphuric acid. It was washed 3 times with 30ml of hot deionised water, connecting
each time to the compressed air for stirring the content of the crucible. After the
last was drained, 150ml of preheated potassium hydroxide were added and 3-5 drops
of antifoam. It was then boiled for 30 minutes, filtered and washed as point 7. A last
washing was performed with cold deionized water aimed to cool crucibles and the
crucible content washed three times with 25ml acetone, stirring each time by
compressed air. The crucibles were removed and dry weight after drying was
determined after drying in an oven at 105oC for an hour. They were allowed to cool
in a desiccator and the weight obtained was a representative of crude fibre plus
ash(F1). The crucibles were then placed in a muffle furnace and heated up to 550oC
for three hours and reweighed after cooling in desiccator (F2). The difference in
weight in comparison to point 12 represented the crude fibre content.
%Crude fibre= (F1-F2)/F0*100

3.12.8 Determination of Total Carbohydrates
This was determined by the Deduction method using the formula;
Total Carbohydrates = 100% - %M.C -% Protein - %Fat - % Ash - % Fibre




3.13 Determination of consumer acceptability of the soursop pulp yogurt and soursop
pulp-lime yogurt
This was carried out in the Food Science and Technology Laboratory of the Uganda
Christian University, Mukono, Uganda in a day.
3.13.1 Choice of panelists and instruction of panelists
A total of 41 panelists were selected (citation missing), and all were yogurt
consumers. Each was taught briefly on how to fill in the consumer acceptability
sheet by defining each term and how they were supposed to convert their
preferences into scores using the 9-point hedonic scale. They were also taught to
rinse their mouths between samples for proper precision of the tastes of the
samples.
The tasting was done before lunchtime to ensure sensitivity of the panelists to the
taste of the samples since the level of satiety affects precision in taste. (citation)

3.14 Sample preparation
Random codes were generated for each sample in order to reduce biases as much as
possible. For each sample, six different codes were generated as follows for easy
identification during data analysis;
Sample 1 (Each code contains exactly one "4"; no 3, 1, or 6, 2% lime juice)
742, 948, 524, 804, 470, 249
Sample 2 (Each code contains exactly one "1"; no 3, 4, or 6, 0% lime juice)
120, 519, 812, 901, 710, 251
Sample 3 (Each code contains exactly one "6"; no 3, 4, or 1, 3% lime juice)
602, 560, 268, 907, 806, 762
2 tablespoons of each sample were added to a white plastic cup for each panellist,
and the samples were placed on a sample tray that had a glass of drinking water for
the panelists to rinse their mouth between samples and a white plastic spoon for
testing.




3.15 Sample setup and tasting
The samples were distributed to each panelist in a random order with sufficient
spaces between panelists to prevent biases. Panelists of close affiliation were not
allowed to sit close to one another to reduce biases. Each panelist was handed a
ballot where they were to score their opinions on the sensory attributes of taste,
consistency, colour, aroma, mouthfeel, overall taste, overall acceptability, and
tangy taste using a 9-point hedonic scale from 1 being “much dislike” to 9 being
“very much like”

3.16 Statistical analysis of results
3.16.1 Acceptability performance of soursop pulp yogurt
Descriptive statistics showing mean scores for each attribute were obtained using
Microsoft Excel and a bar graph was drawn to show the baseline acceptability of the
soursop pulp yogurt.

3.16.2 Comparison between soursop pulp-lime yogurt and conventional fruit yogurt
A one sample t test was done to compare the fat, vitamin C, fibre, carbohydrate and
protein content of the two sample treatments because only two samples were being
compared and it was being done between conventional yogurt (which had standard
means of nutrients from the yogurt population) and the soursop pulp- lime yogurt.
Descriptive analysis of means, standard deviation was done using Microsoft Excel and
the results were inputted into the statology software to carry out the t test and the
p value from comparison of each attribute obtained was used to determine whether
the two treatments were significantly different from each other for each attribute.
If the p value was greater than 0.001, then the samples were not considered
significantly different from each other in that nutrient, if the p value was less than
0.001, the samples were significantly different from each other in that attribute.




3.16.3 Determination of consumer acceptability of soursop pulp yogurt and soursop
pulp- lime yogurt
An Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was done since more than two treatments were
being compared. This was done in Microsoft excel using a one-way ANOVA since only
one treatment was being varied to be obtain descriptive statistics such as means and
standard deviation (SD). The alpha used was 0.05 to determine the level of
significance. P values from the ANOVA table that were greater than 0.05 showed
that there were not significant differences in the acceptability of those samples in
that given sensory attribute. Subscripts were assigned to the means and means with
the same subscripts were not significantly different from each other down a given
column.

4.2 Discussion of results
4.2.1 TABLE 1
The soursop yogurt performed averagely well across all measured attributes, with
scores ranging approximately between 5.5 and 6.5 out of 7. This indicated a
generally positive consumer acceptance across all sensory attributes. Colour
received one of the highest ratings (approximately 6.5), suggesting consumers found
the visual appearance of the soursop yogurt particularly appealing.
Tangy Taste received the lowest rating (approximately 5.5), though it was still a
positive. This was most likely due to the strong taste from the soursop, as mentioned
by some panelists. This might indicate that while consumers generally accepted the
taste profile, the specific tanginess of the soursop yogurt could potentially be
adjusted to better meet consumer preferences. Consistency, Aroma, Overall Taste,
Mouthfeel, and Overall Acceptability all scored similarly (approximately 6.0),
demonstrating balanced sensory characteristics.
The Overall Acceptability score (approximately 6.0) aligns with the average of most
other attributes, suggesting that in general, the acceptability of the yogurt was
slightly above the average score and therefore the yogurt was slightly good.

4.2.2 TABLE 2
The p-value is less than 0.001 for protein, total fat, total carbohydrate, total fibre,
and vitamin C. This indicated that there is a significant difference in the protein,
total fat, total carbohydrate, total fibre, and vitamin C content of the soursop pulplime yogurt (3%) and that of the strawberry fruit yogurt. Strawberry fruit yogurt was
chosen for the comparison because the addition of fruits to yogurt increases fibre
and vitamin C content in yogurt, which are absent in non-fruit sweetened yogurts,
so its nutritional properties are the closest to those of soursop pulp-lime yogurt.



It was also observed that the protein content in the soursop pulp-lime yogurt was
0.25g higher (slightly higher) than that in strawberry fruit yogurt, and this was
because soursop naturally contains proteins (Makebe Calister Wingang, 2021). In
addition, the fat content in the soursop pulp-lime yogurt was 0.19g higher (slightly
higher) than that of the strawberry fruit yogurt because soursop, being a fruit,
naturally contains traces of natural oils (Nguyen T.T et al, 2020). The total
carbohydrate content was 9g less than that of the strawberry fruit yogurt, indicating
a reduction in sugars. The total fibre content in the soursop pulp-lime yogurt was
slightly higher than that of strawberry fruit yogurt. Last but not least, the vitamin C
content in the soursop pulp-lime yogurt was 10.25g higher than that in strawberry
yogurt. This was because both soursop and lime are naturally rich in vitamin C
(Prasetyo, C., & Candra, A., 2017).

4.2.3 TABLE 3
The sensory evaluation results for the three treatments (T1: 0% lime juice, T2: 2%
lime juice, and T3: 3% lime juice) revealed variations in sensory attributes such as
colour, aroma, consistency, tangy taste, overall taste, mouthfeel, and overall
acceptability. The colour scores ranged from 6.3 ± 1.45 (T1) to 6.8 ± 1.49 (T3). T3
(3% lime juice) had the highest colour score, which suggested that the addition of
lime juice enhanced the visual appeal of the product. However, the differences
among treatments were not statistically significant, as indicated by the shared
superscripts.
Aroma scores were highest for T2 and lowest for T3. While T2 showed a slight
improvement in aroma compared to T1, the differences were not significant across
treatments. This indicates that lime juice addition did not affect the aroma
perception. The consistency improved with increasing lime juice concentration, with
T3 scoring the highest compared to T1 because lime juice breaks down proteins and
fibre. However, the difference between treatments was minimal and statistically
insignificant, suggesting that lime juice had a limited effect on this attribute.
Tangy taste scores increased from T1 to T2, but decreased in T3. Feedback from the
panelists suggested that most attributed the tangy taste to the strong flavor of the
soursop, and so 2% lime juice had done little to overpower the strong flavor from



the soursop, but 3% lime did have a better effect on counteracting the strong soursop
taste hence the decrease in the tangy taste. The differences were not statistically
significant but highlight a potential threshold for acceptable tanginess. The overall
taste was rated highest for T2, followed by T1 and lowest for T3, but the differences
were minimal and therefore suggested that lime juice had a negligible impact on
the overall taste.
Mouthfeel scores decreased slightly with increasing lime juice concentration, from
T1 to T3. The differences were minor and not statistically significant, suggesting
that lime juice addition had a negligible impact on this sensory attribute. Overall
acceptability followed a similar trend to overall taste, with T2 scoring the highest,
followed by T1, and T3 scoring the lowest.




















CHAPTER FIVE
5.0 SUMMARY, CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
5.1 Summary
This study aimed to produce a sugar-free yogurt using soursop pulp as a natural
sweetener and lime juice as a flavorant, assessing their impact on the yogurt's
nutritional, sensory, and physicochemical properties. The specific objectives
included determining the vitamin C, protein, carbohydrate, fat, and fibre content
of the soursop pulp-lime yogurt compared to conventional fruit yogurt, and
evaluating the consumer acceptability of the developed yogurt.
The physicochemical analysis revealed significant differences (p < 0.001) in protein,
total fat, total carbohydrate, total fibre, and vitamin C content between the soursop
pulp-lime yogurt and a strawberry fruit yogurt used for comparison. The soursop
pulp-lime yogurt exhibited slightly higher protein and fat content, which can be
attributed to the natural composition of soursop. Notably, the carbohydrate content
was significantly lower, indicating a reduction in sugars due to the substitution of
refined sugar with soursop pulp. The fibre content in soursop pulp-lime yogurt was
slightly higher than that in conventional strawberry fruit yogurt and this suggested
that soursop contains a higher quantity of fibre than strawberry fruit. In addition,
the vitamin C content was also higher in the soursop pulp-lime yogurt, which can be
attributed to the inherent Vitamin C content of soursop and lime.
The sensory evaluation of the yogurt with varying concentrations of lime juice (0%,
2%, and 3%) showed variations in sensory attributes. Colour scores were highest for
the 3% lime juice treatment, suggesting enhanced visual appeal, but the differences
were not statistically significant. Aroma scores were slightly improved with the 2%
lime juice, but again, the differences were not significant. The consistency improved
with increasing lime juice concentration, although the effect was minimal. The
tangy taste was highest with the 2% lime juice, but decreased with 3%, possibly
because higher lime juice concentration overpowered the tangy taste from the
soursop pulp. The consistency scores increased consistently across all treatments
probably due to the fact that acidity leads breakdown of proteins and fibre forming
a smoother consistency. The overall taste was rated highest for the 2% lime juice,
suggesting that moderate addition enhanced the flavor profile, while the 3%
concentration had a negative impact. The mouthfeel had a slight and consistent



decrease across all treatments due to increase in the astringent taste from the lime
juice, and the overall acceptability was highest for the 2% lime juice.

5.2 Conclusions
The first null hypothesis stated that there is no difference in the vitamin C, protein,
carbohydrate, fat and fibre content of soursop pulp-lime yogurt and that of
conventional fruit yogurt but the results showed that there was a significant
difference in the nutrient content of the two yogurt treatments and therefore we
reject the null hypothesis.
The second null hypothesis stated that there is no difference in the consumer
acceptability of soursop pulp yogurt and soursop pulp-lime yogurt. The results
showed there was no significant difference in the consumer acceptability of soursop
pulp yogurt and soursop pulp-lime yogurt and hence we do not reject the hypothesis.
Overall, the study demonstrated that soursop pulp can effectively replace refined
sugar in yogurt production, resulting in a product with comparable or improved
nutritional properties. The addition of lime juice at a 2% concentration enhanced
the sensory attributes and overall acceptability of the yogurt.
Soursop pulp-lime yogurt has a distinct nutritional profile compared to conventional
strawberry fruit yogurt. It is slightly higher in protein and fat (due to the natural
composition of soursop), significantly lower in carbohydrates (due to sugar
substitution), and higher in fibre and vitamin C (due to soursop and lime). This yogurt
offers a potentially healthier alternative with reduced sugar content and increased
micronutrients.
The addition of lime juice at a 2% concentration (T2) improved the sensory attributes
and overall acceptability of soursop pulp yogurt. While colour and consistency
improvements were observed with a 3% concentration (T3), the tangy taste became
less appealing, negatively impacting the overall taste and acceptability. The 2% lime
juice concentration strikes a balance, enhancing the flavor profile without
overwhelming the soursop taste.




5.3 Recommendations
To increase the accuracy and reliability of the results, future studies should replicate
this research if they are to use a Completely Randomized Design (CRD). CRD can help
to minimize variability and provide more robust statistical analysis.
Further research should focus on optimizing the amount of soursop pulp used to
ensure better sweetness and overall taste. Varying the concentration of soursop pulp
and conducting sensory evaluations can help determine the optimal level that
provides adequate sweetness without compromising other sensory attributes.
Given that aroma scores were relatively lower for all treatments, future research
could explore the addition of natural aromas like maple syrup for a natural caramel
colour and aroma or different varieties of lime to boost the aroma.
Since mouthfeel also received moderate scores, more maxigel could be added to the
yogurt to improve the texture and mouthfeel.
Further research can be carried out on the use of other citrus fruits, such as lemon
juice or orange, which could offer better sensory attributes than lime juice.
Further studies can also be done on the microbial quality of the yogurt to determine
its shelf life and stability of sensory attributes for a given period of time.
