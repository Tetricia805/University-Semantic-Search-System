❏
Evolution: Transition to NSFNET and the commercial Internet.

How the Internet Works
Clients and Servers:

❏
Servers provide data (e.g., web servers).
IP Address:
❏
Unique numerical label for devices on a network.
Domain Name System (DNS):
❏
Converts domain names to IP addresses.

Phishing: Fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive information.
❏
DDoS Attacks: Overwhelming a server to disrupt services.

Best Practices for Internet Security
Strong Passwords:
❏
Use complex, unique passwords.
❏
Change passwords regularly.
Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):
❏
Adds a second layer of security.
Regular Software Updates:
❏
Protect against vulnerabilities.

Practical Session: Exploring the Web
Web Browsing:
❏
Navigate websites to understand URLs and links.
Viewing Page Source:
❏
Inspect HTML, CSS, and JavaScript of web pages.
Setting Up a Basic Web Server:
❏
Use Python's SimpleHTTPServer or XAMPP.
❏
Host a basic HTML page locally.

Practical Session: Network Exploration
The ping Command:
➔
Test connectivity to websites.
The traceroute Command:
➔
Explore the path data takes across the Internet.

The Web

What Does Web Mean?
The Web is the common name for the World Wide Web, a subset of the Internet
consisting of the pages that can be accessed by a Web browser. Many people assume
that the Web is the same as the Internet, and use these terms interchangeably.
However, the term Internet actually refers to the global network of servers that
makes the information sharing that happens over the Web possible.
So, although the Web does make up a large portion of the Internet, but they are not
one and same.

Vague but exciting!
In March 1989, a proposal was sent internally at CERN outlying a universal linked
information system. Dubbed 'Information Management: A proposal', pictured below, the
proposal was created by Sir Tim Berners-Lee and was sent to his boss Mike Sendall,
who described it as 'vague but exciting...'.
Sir Tim Berners-Lee’s vision for universality enabled the development of a
high-level network of content that allows any document to link to any other
documents.
The World Wide Web was initially created to make it easier to share research papers.
It is a system of interlinked ‘hypertext’ documents that are accessed via the
Internet; in essence, an information space. While he did not invent hypertext
systems, Berners-Lee proposed using them 'to link and access information of various
kinds as a web of nodes in which the user can browse at will.'

His
breakthrough
was
to
link
hypertext to the Internet and he used
three technologies to do this:
●
HyperText
Transfer
Protocol
(HTTP) is the foundation of data
communication for the Web.
●
HyperText Markup Language (HTML)
is the main markup language for
creating
Web
pages
and
information that can be displayed
on a Web browser.
●
Web
addresses
or
a
Uniform
Resource Locator (URL) are used
to reference a Web page.

Regulation of the Web

What is W3C?
The World Wide Web Consortium is the main international standards organization for
the World Wide Web. Founded in 1994 and currently led by Tim Berners-Lee, the
consortium is made up of member organizations that maintain full-time staff working
together in the development of standards for the World Wide Web.
The W3C community is passionate about creating free and open Web standards. They
value that the Web is:
1.
Universal, international and truly “World Wide”
2.
Available on any device, for any type of information, in any language
3.
Accessible by people with disabilities
4.
Royalty-free and built on open standards
5.
Powerful – The Open Web Platform makes Web pages themselves powerful tools
6.
Transformational for how business gets done; improving delivery, enhancing user
satisfaction, and reducing costs

Diversity and Inclusion

What is Web accessibility?
The power of the Web is in its universality.
Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect.
Tim Berners-Lee, W3C Director and inventor of the World Wide Web
The Web has become an essential aspect of our daily lives, and everyone should have
access to this technology. Web accessibility focuses on ensuring equivalent access
for people with disabilities. It is increasingly important to many organizations and
governments from around the world, and has many business benefits. Access to
information, including on the Web, is also recognized by the UN Convention on the
Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD).

Who is impacted?
Web accessibility addresses all disabilities, including hearing,
learning and cognitive, neurological, physical, speech, and visual
disabilities. Some examples of Web accessibility features include:
●
Captions on audio and multimedia content for people who are hard of
hearing;
●
Clear and consistent layout for people with learning and cognitive
disabilities;
●
Keyboard support for people who do not use their mouse, for
example, people with physical disabilities;
●
Text alternatives for people with visual disabilities and who are
using screen readers.

Web accessibility benefits people with and without disabilities
Web accessibility features also benefit many more users, such as:
❏
People with temporary situational limitations, such as a broken arm;
❏
People using mobile devices, televisions, and other access channels;
❏
People using older computers, with low bandwidth, and other limitations;
❏
People who are new to computers, to the Web, or to your own Website;
❏
People who are not fluent in the language of your particular Web site.
The Web is an increasingly important resource in many aspects of life:
education, employment, government, commerce, health care, recreation, and
more. When Web pages, Web technologies, Web tools, or Web applications are
badly designed, they can create barriers that exclude people from using the
Web.
