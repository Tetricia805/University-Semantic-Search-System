ABSTRACT
The growing demand for affordable and sustainable building materials in Uganda,
coupled with increasing environmental concerns, has prompted the need to explore
alternative methods of clay brick stabilization. Conventional clay bricks are
typically fired using firewood, a practice that contributes heavily to deforestation,
carbon emissions, and other forms of environmental degradation. This research
investigates the feasibility of using a hybrid stabilization method involving a bioenzyme (Terrazyme) and pineapple leaf fiber (PALF) to improve the engineering
properties of clay bricks while minimizing ecological impact.

The study was conducted using high plasticity clay obtained from Siron Village,
Kirwoko Parish in Kaptanya Subcounty, Kapchorwa District. The clay soil underwent
a series of laboratory tests, including particle size distribution, Atterberg limits,
compaction, compressive strength, shrinkage, and water absorption tests in
accordance with British Standards. PALF was extracted from agricultural waste,
characterized through tensile strength analysis, and evaluated for reinforcement
suitability. Terrazyme was produced through a controlled fermentation process and
tested for pH, viscosity, and concentration.
Experimental brick samples were prepared using varying proportions of PALF (2%–
6%) and Terrazyme (0%–5%) by weight and volume respectively. Among all the
combinations, the optimal mix—2% PALF and 100 ml/m3 of Terrazyme—produced
unfired bricks with the best performance. These bricks achieved a compressive
strength of 2.7 MPa, which is significantly higher than that of untreated bricks, and


showed a 15% reduction in water absorption and 30% reduction in linear shrinkage.
The hybrid stabilization not only enhanced strength and dimensional stability but
also improved durability by reducing moisture susceptibility and potential for
cracking.
The results of this research confirm that hybrid stabilization using bio-enzymes and
natural fibers can produce structurally sound, cost-effective, and environmentally
sustainable clay bricks without the need for high-temperature firing. This technique
holds great potential for application in rural housing, eco-construction, and
lowincome settlements across Uganda. Moreover, the use of locally available
materials such as pineapple leaves promotes circular economy practices and
reduces agricultural waste. The study concludes by recommending further field
trials, scaleup studies, and long-term performance evaluations under various
climatic conditions to establish the method as a mainstream construction practice.

CHAPTER I: INTRODUCTION
1.1
Background and Introduction
Like most developing countries, Uganda has a large housing deficit contributed by
its rapid growth in population and urbanization. Clay bricks remain among the most
widely applied building materials within both rural and urban areas, mostly because
of their comparatively lower costs and higher accessibility. Most of this production
is at a small scale and in places like Siron, where high plasticity clay is locally
available. Such clay must be stabilized to enhance its strength and durability.
These are typically fired with firewood, which is very energy-intensive and
destructive to the environment. Relating to this, it contributes to deforestation,
which means loss of biodiversity, soil erosion, and also causes a high rate of carbon
dioxide emission. According to a report by Bodipo-Memba et al., 2022, it is stated
that Uganda loses its forests annually by 1.8%, proportionately with a higher part
of this deforestation mainly belongs to the collection of fuelwood for brick kilns. If
that wasn't enough, high-plasticity clays rich in montmorillonite, such as in Mukono
for example, bring additional troubles: these soils swell with increase in water
content and shrink with decrease, thus they do not present structural stability
unless better stabilized. As said, increased firing resolves this, but the
environmental and financial costs of brick kilns are very high. Application of
firewood-saving alternative stabilization methods thus stands as a pressing need.
The application of bio-enzyme technology, alongside the utilization of agricultural
byproducts such as pineapple leaf fiber, is gaining recognition as a sustainable


method to improve the resilience and structural integrity of clay bricks,
concurrently reducing environmental repercussions (Saini & Vaishnava, 2015).
Although it populates the places with intensive pineapple culture, pineapple leaf
fiber is regarded as a waste product. While it has very good tensile strength and
binding properties, using it as reinforcement material in the construction industries
is worth the result it has shown in tests. Razman et al., 2024 The current work
represents an ecologically friendly method of using a bio-enzyme coupled with
stabilisation, which is the use of PALF for solving problems with plasticity in clay
soil, reduction in various environmental crises connected with traditional
production methods of bricks.




1.2
Problem Statement
The Ugandan manufacturing of clay bricks is so dependent on firewood; this
enhances deforestation and environmental degradation. According to the
Ministry of Water and Environment of Uganda as cited by Bodipo-Memba et al. 2022,
it is estimated that about 70% of energy that is used in brick kilns is firewood,
costing about 92,000 hectares of forest loss annually.
Besides just accelerating this process of deforestation, it also emits a lot of carbon
dioxide into the atmosphere, hence contributing to the climate crisis. With
increased expansion in the brick-making industry, Uganda is getting increasingly
unsustainable and inching closer to an ecological disaster. In addition, conventional
clay bricks, specifically made from smectite clays found in eastern Uganda,
precisely in Budadiri, Chelel, Mutufu, and Siron areas, have insufficient mechanical
strength. Smectite clays, having high acidities with values between 0.1 and 1.85
mol/g, with compositions of 40-50% smectite, 2030% being the feldspars
component, and other element makeups like iron, aluminum, and silicon being 11%,
18%, and 60%, respectively, perform moderately, with high absorption of water to
yield bricks that are weak and brittle (Wasajja-Navoyojo et al., 2016; Mukasa-
Tebandeke et al., 2015).
The mean compressive strength for these conventional bricks range between 0.36
and 1.2 MPa, a measure below the standards in global construction standards
according to MukasaTebandeke et al. 2014.


Lime and cement have conventionally been used as additives to improve brick
standards; however, their production is highly energy-intensive and one of the
major contributors to green house gases. For instance, cement industries alone
contribute about 8% to global carbon emissions (Andrew, 2019). There thus is an
urgent need for environmentally friendly products that will help in stabilizing clay
bricks without reliance on high-energy materials like cement and lime.
The bio-enzymatic treatments may increase the cohesion in soils, decrease the
permeability, and enhance compressive strength of clays by ion exchange reaction
mechanisms which favored the development of stable aggregates. According to
Saini & Vaishnava, 2015, bioenzyme-treated bricks demonstrated better
compressive strength of as high as 4 MPa compared with conventional bricks.
Addition of PALF, a full natural resource in Uganda, improves significantly the
mechanical properties of the clay bricks. Presence of PALF improves the tensile
strength and durability in the composites hence an ideal material for reinforcement
in bricks. This paper tries to integrate the use of bio-enzymes and PALF in the
production of bricks with the aim of attaining environmental sustainable
stabilization methods that reduce reliance on kiln firing, environmental
degradation and enhances the mechanical efficiency of the fired clay bricks.
Bricks with increased compressive strength and improved on water absorption, and
with an increased life compared to the traditional method, are expected.
This work, therefore, investigates the application of bio-enzyme and pineapple leaf
fibers as additives for stabilization in clay bricks.


1.3

To assess the use of a bio-enzyme and pineapple leaf fibers as a stabilizer in clay
bricks.
1.3.1 Specific Objectives
1.
To determine the soil properties of the clay brick.
2.
To determine the chemical properties of the bio-enzyme and physical
properties of pineapple leaf fibers.
3.
To identify the optimal ratio of bio-enzyme and pineapple leaf fiber for
effective clay brick stabilization.

2.
What is the biochemical nature of bio-enzymes, and what is the physical
property of pineapple leaf fibers?
3.

1.4
Justification
The soils mainly consist of Montmorillonites in the Siron Village of Kirwoko Parish,
Kaptanya Subcounty, Kapchorwa District. These clay soils are clayey in nature and
have similar mechanical properties to those of the Kaolinite group in regards to
swelling. It means that they have ability of exchange cations so cations are well
bonded to water which is the reason why these clays increase and expand following
the adsorbed water content increase.
Bioenzymes particularly terrazyme, which is any organic, non-toxic formulation
resulting from the fermentation of fruits and vegetables residues, have the capacity
to enhance the engineering properties of soil improvements by mobilising enormous
quantities of soil and cation structure on a particlebasis in the soil, reducing
hydration and increasing definable strength (Shah,
2017; Suresh, 2017). Some studies on the effect of Terrazyme on the California
Bearing Ratio of the soil at different Terrazyme dosages have shown very good
improvement in the strength of the soil, with 0.5 ml solution per 100 ml of water
as the best dose (Suresh, 2017; Panchal, 2017). Treatment with chemicals helps
increase the strength of the soil, reduce the thickness of the pavement and allows
a 30% reduction on the cost of building roads (Suresh, 2017). This method is an
efficient way of stabilizing the soil without damaging the nature and is extending
to all activities especially in the geo-technical applications.
The fiber of pineapple leaf (PALF) has also been used to good results in the
reinforcement of clay and earth bricks. Encouraging mechanical properties have


also been realized with pineapple leaf fiber (PLF) and for a range of applications.
Composites based on PLF/PLA showed good strength, which varies from 16.71 MPa
to 76.47 MPa depending on the matrix and fiber content. The optimum amount of
fibers required for the mechanical properties is usually in the order of 30-40%
(Susilowati & Sumardiyanto, 2018; Odusote & Kumar, 2016).




1.5
Significance of the Study
This study holds great significance for both the local community in Siron Village,
Kirwoko Parish, and the broader construction and environmental sectors. The clay
soils in this region, rich in Montmorillonites, exhibit characteristics such as swelling
due to their high cation exchange capacity and water retention properties. These
traits often lead to structural challenges in traditional clay bricks, reducing their
durability and reliability. Therefore, there is a pressing need for a more sustainable
and robust method of clay brick stabilization to improve the quality of construction
materials.
The integration of bio-enzyme, specifically Terrazyme, and pineapple leaf fibers
(PALF) offers an innovative approach to soil stabilization. Terrazyme, a non-toxic
organic formulation derived from the fermentation of fruit and vegetable residues,
has been shown to significantly enhance the engineering properties of soils. Studies
have demonstrated that Terrazyme improves soil strength by mobilizing cations and
reducing hydration, making it a promising agent for stabilizing clay bricks (Shah,
2017; Suresh, 2017). The ability to strengthen soil without harming the environment
provides a crucial alternative to conventional stabilization techniques, especially
in rural areas like Siron Village. Furthermore, the cost-effectiveness of this method,
with potential savings of up to 30% in construction costs, makes it an attractive
solution for low-income communities (Suresh, 2017).
In addition, pineapple leaf fibers, a readily available agricultural byproduct, offer
a sustainable reinforcement material for clay bricks. PALF has been proven to


enhance the mechanical properties of composites, with strength values ranging
from 16.71 MPa to 76.47 MPa depending on the fiber content (Susilowati &
Sumardiyanto, 2018; Odusote & Kumar, 2016). This study will explore the optimal
ratio of PALF and bio-enzyme for stabilizing clay bricks, providing valuable insights
for future applications in eco-friendly construction.
The potential to use natural, locally sourced materials like PALF not only promotes
sustainability but also supports local economies by utilizing agricultural waste.
By assessing the combined use of bio-enzymes and PALF in stabilizing clay bricks,
this research contributes to the development of environmentally sustainable
building materials.
The findings could revolutionize brick production, reducing deforestation and
carbon emissions associated with traditional kiln-fired bricks, while simultaneously
enhancing the mechanical properties of the bricks used in construction. This study
is, therefore, a step toward more resilient and sustainable infrastructure,
particularly in Uganda, where clay bricks are a primary construction material.
1.6
Scope
The present investigation will be limited to surveying the properties of Siron clay
located in Siron Village in Kirwoko Parish of Kaptanya Subcounty, Kapchorwa
District, Uganda. The attention will be given to appreciation of chemical and
physical properties of bio-enzyme and pineapple leaf fibers, their optimal and
blends for stabilization of bricks and the bricks ability to become harder with the


compositions in terms of engineering properties. Laboratory tests will be carried
out on various percentages of bio-enzyme and pineapple leaf fiber stabilizing
compounds on bricks.






CHAPTER II: Literature Review
2.1
Literature Review
Most of the raw materials for the manufacture of clay bricks are available within
the country, thereby largely contributing to the construction industry in Uganda.
However, traditional manufacturing techniques solely depend on the use of
firewood for firing in the kiln, which results in devastating environmental
degradation through deforestation and carbon emissions. It is this dire need that
propels various ways of stabilizing clay bricks with a minimal ecological footprint
and improves mechanical properties.
2.1.1 Environmental Impact of Burning Conventional Clay Bricks
The environmental implications of traditional clay brick production are profound
and increasingly unsustainable. In Uganda, as in many developing nations,
conventional brick production largely depends on kiln firing using firewood. This
practice is directly responsible for widespread deforestation. According to Bodipo-
Memba et al. (2022), an estimated 70% of energy consumed in rural brick kilns
originates from firewood, leading to the destruction of approximately 92,000
hectares of forest annually. This deforestation accelerates soil erosion, disrupts
local water cycles, and threatens biodiversity.

In addition to land degradation, the carbon footprint of brick firing is substantial.
Emissions from brick kilns include carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), sulfur
oxides (SOx), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5).
These pollutants contribute to atmospheric warming and pose serious health risks
to workers and nearby residents. Zhang et al. (2014) observed that traditional kilns


in South Asia emit as much as 1.1 kg of CO2 per brick, with significant contributions
from incomplete combustion. In Uganda, similar inefficient practices prevail, with
little regulation or emission control technology in place.

Moreover, the economic sustainability of brick firing is questionable. Firewood costs
continue to rise due to increasing scarcity, making kiln operation expensive for
small-scale producers. A study by Kumar and Prasad (2020) noted that the fuel
cost can account for up to 40% of total brick production expenses. As firewood
becomes more difficult to access, communities are pushed toward protected areas,
exacerbating illegal logging activities.

Alternatives to fired bricks have been explored globally, including compressed
stabilized earth blocks (CSEBs), fly ash bricks, and chemical stabilization techniques
that eliminate the need for high-temperature treatment. However, adoption in
Uganda has been limited due to lack of awareness, training, and technical support.
Introducing biologically stabilized unfired bricks using organic additives such as bioenzymes and agricultural fibers presents a promising alternative that aligns with
global sustainability objectives and Uganda's environmental policy goals.

Furthermore, the issue is not isolated to deforestation alone. The process
contributes to poor air quality and poses occupational hazards to workers exposed
to smoke and high temperatures. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates
that indoor and outdoor air pollution from biomass burning causes over 4 million


premature deaths annually, a risk extended to brick workers in low-regulation
contexts (WHO, 2021).

In conclusion, conventional clay brick manufacturing is environmentally and
economically unsustainable. It contributes heavily to Uganda’s deforestation,
elevates greenhouse gas emissions, and introduces health risks to local
communities. The need to transition toward greener brick stabilization techniques,
such as the use of unfired clay bricks enhanced with natural binders, is both urgent
and feasible. These alternatives can drastically reduce ecological degradation while
promoting sustainable rural development and green construction practices.
2.1.2 Clayey Soil Characteristics and Challenges of Stabilization
Clay soils, particularly those rich in montmorillonite, present some of the most
complex geotechnical challenges in civil engineering. These soils are commonly
found across Uganda, including in regions like Kapchorwa, Mbale, and Siron Village.
Their high shrink-swell capacity, coupled with low natural strength, makes them
problematic for use in construction applications without proper stabilization.
Montmorillonite-rich clays possess a high specific surface area and an extraordinary
affinity for water. This leads to expansive behavior where the soil volume
drastically increases upon water absorption and contracts significantly during
drying. This volumetric instability can lead to cracking, subsidence, and general
loss of structural integrity when such soils are used in untreated forms for brick
production (Wasajja-Navoyojo et al., 2016).


Characterization tests such as the Atterberg Limits confirm the challenges posed by
these soils. Plasticity Index (PI) values in montmorillonite soils commonly exceed
30%, placing them in the high-plasticity classification. These indices are indicative
of soils that will not maintain form or load-bearing capacity without modification.
In Uganda, compressive strengths for unstabilized bricks made from these clays
range between 0.36 MPa and 1.2 MPa—far below the 2 MPa standard for unfired
bricks and the 5 MPa threshold for fired ones (Mukasa-Tebandeke et al., 2015).
Traditional approaches to stabilizing clay involve adding cement or lime. While
effective in increasing compressive strength and reducing shrinkage, these
additives are associated with high environmental and economic costs. Cement
production alone is responsible for approximately 8% of global CO2 emissions
(Andrew, 2019). Lime, while slightly less polluting, also requires significant energy
to produce and transport.
Moreover, cement and lime stabilization tend to increase the stiffness and
brittleness of the resulting material, which may lead to cracking under tensile stress
unless counterbalanced with flexible additives. Their use is often impractical in
rural settings due to high costs, poor availability, and lack of technical expertise.
Alternative methods are now being explored globally, and Uganda is gradually
catching up. Bio-based solutions, including the application of enzymes and natural
fibers, offer a low-carbon, locally sourced option for stabilization. These methods
not only improve mechanical properties but also offer flexibility, resilience, and
compatibility with local construction practices. Recent studies have shown that


integrating pineapple leaf fiber (PALF) into expansive clay matrices significantly
improves their tensile strength and controls shrinkage behavior (Odusote & Kumar,
2016).
Furthermore, stabilization is not just about improving strength. Long-term
performance under variable moisture conditions is crucial. Many clay bricks fail not
because they are weak initially but because they degrade rapidly when exposed to
rain, humidity, and temperature changes. High water absorption rates—often >15%
in untreated bricks—lead to disintegration, mold growth, and structural failure. The
ability to reduce this value to below 10% through hybrid stabilization techniques is
an important marker of long-term durability (Kumar & Baser, 2016).

In conclusion, the nature of clayey soils in Uganda presents a unique challenge to
civil engineers, especially in the context of low-cost housing. While conventional
stabilizers like cement and lime offer strength, they fall short in sustainability and
practicality. New hybrid stabilization methods—combining bio-enzymes with
natural fibers—promise not only better mechanical performance but also
environmentally responsible and community-appropriate solutions.




2.1.3 Bio-enzyme treatment of clayey soils.
Bio- Bio-enzymes are increasingly being recognized as sustainable alternatives to
traditional chemical stabilizers in geotechnical engineering. Derived from the
fermentation of organic matter such as molasses, plant extracts, or agricultural
waste, bio-enzymes like Terrazyme, Perma-Zyme, and Renolith are biodegradable,
non-toxic, and easy to apply. These enzymes work by modifying the interaction
between clay particles and water, enhancing compaction, and improving soil
strength and water resistance (Saini & Vaishnava, 2015).
The mechanism of action of bio-enzymes is both chemical and biological. When
applied to soil, enzymes catalyze ion-exchange reactions that replace weakly bound
water molecules with more stable cations like calcium or magnesium. This leads to
flocculation of clay particles and reduction in double-layer thickness, thereby
increasing soil density and reducing permeability (Shah & Suresh, 2017). In effect,
this mimics the function of lime or cement but without the associated carbon
emissions or environmental toxicity.
Research from Amu et al. (2005) demonstrated that enzyme-treated clay soils
achieved compressive strengths upwards of 3.5 MPa, depending on the curing period
and soil type. In road construction projects across India and Kenya, Terrazyme has
been effectively used to reduce swelling potential by more than 50%, improve
California Bearing Ratio (CBR) values by 200%, and enhance water resistance
(Kumar & Baser, 2016).


A key advantage of bio-enzymes is their ability to function effectively in tropical
soils, such as those in East Africa. These soils are often rich in organic content and
moisture, which enhances enzyme activity. In contrast to cement or lime, which
may require soil to be oven-dry or treated under specific pH conditions, bioenzymes work well in field conditions with minimal preparation, making them
highly appropriate for rural, low-cost construction (Jawaid & Abdul Khalil, 2011).
In the context of unfired clay bricks, bio-enzymes serve multiple functions. Firstly,
they promote better compaction, which leads to higher density and improved loadbearing capacity. Secondly, they significantly reduce the moisture absorption rate
of the bricks, minimizing swelling, shrinkage, and cracking over time. Thirdly, the
enzymatic treatment facilitates quicker setting and reduced curing time, which is
advantageous in humid regions where extended drying can be problematic (Jittin
et al., 2022).
Despite their advantages, the adoption of bio-enzymes in Uganda remains limited
due to lack of awareness, technical skepticism, and the absence of established
regulatory standards. However, pilot projects supported by NGOs and engineering
research institutions have begun to highlight the feasibility of enzyme-based
stabilization for rural roads, earthen buildings, and unfired bricks.
Challenges that remain include ensuring consistent enzyme quality, determining
the optimal dosage for different soil types, and validating long-term performance
through field trials. Moreover, more research is needed to understand interactions


between bio-enzymes and other stabilizers, particularly natural fibers, to develop
hybrid solutions that are both cost-effective and durable.
In conclusion, bio-enzymes offer a sustainable, efficient, and practical solution for
stabilizing clayey soils, particularly in the production of unfired bricks. Their
integration into Uganda’s construction sector could represent a significant step
toward achieving environmentally responsible and cost-effective building practices.




2.1.4 Utilization of Pineapple Leaf Fiber (PALF) as Reinforcement Material
Pineapple Leaf Fiber (PALF) is an agro-waste byproduct derived from pineapple
cultivation, which is abundant in tropical countries like Uganda. As a natural
lignocellulosic fiber, PALF is composed of cellulose (70–80%), hemicellulose, lignin,
and minor amounts of waxes and pectin. These constituents make it both strong
and biodegradable, rendering PALF highly suitable for use in green composite
materials and soil-based construction components such as stabilized clay bricks
(Kasim et al., 2015).
The physical and mechanical properties of PALF, including high tensile strength
(ranging from 200 to 600 MPa), low density (~1.5 g/cm3), and moderate
elongation at break, make it an ideal reinforcing material. The fiber’s high cellulose
content contributes to its strength, while the relatively low lignin percentage
enhances its flexibility (Susilowati & Sumardiyanto, 2018). These characteristics
allow PALF to act as a micro-reinforcement that mitigates crack propagation in clay
bricks by bridging voids and holding particles together under stress.
Incorporation of PALF into clay bricks has demonstrated improvements in both
mechanical strength and dimensional stability. For example, studies by Odusote &
Kumar (2016) and Razman et al. (2024) show that adding 2–6% PALF by weight of
soil significantly reduces linear shrinkage and enhances resistance to deformation.
This is particularly crucial in high-plasticity soils where volume changes due to
moisture fluctuations lead to cracking. PALF's inclusion provides tensile resilience,
an aspect often lacking in conventional bricks.


In addition to strength enhancement, PALF plays a critical role in reducing water
absorption. The fiber network interrupts capillary pathways, slowing down moisture
ingress and enhancing the brick’s resistance to disintegration from water-induced
stresses. Kasim et al. (2015) found that bricks reinforced with 4% PALF exhibited
up to a 20% reduction in water absorption compared to unreinforced controls.
Another environmental benefit is PALF's role in promoting circular economy
practices. Pineapple plantations generate vast quantities of leaf waste that
typically go unused or are burned, contributing to air pollution. By extracting PALF
and incorporating it into bricks, this waste is given economic value while reducing
environmental degradation. This approach aligns with Uganda’s sustainable
development goals, especially regarding responsible consumption and production
(UN SDG 12).

Processing PALF, however, requires careful attention. Mechanical extraction and
retting (biological separation of fiber bundles) are common methods. Improper
retting can leave behind residual lignin or pectin, reducing bond strength with the
clay matrix. Alkali treatment (e.g., soaking in NaOH, ash treatment ) is often used
to clean and roughen the fiber surface, improving mechanical interlock and
adhesion with the soil particles (Jawaid & Abdul Khalil, 2011).
Despite its promising properties, challenges remain in standardizing PALF
applications. Fiber length, aspect ratio, and distribution need to be optimized to
prevent fiber clustering, which may weaken instead of reinforce the bricks.
Moreover, long-term durability under tropical weather conditions is still under


investigation, although preliminary results show good resistance to biodegradation
when PALF is embedded within dense clay matrices (Kumar & Prasad, 2020).
In summary, the use of PALF in clay brick stabilization represents a technically
feasible and environmentally responsible innovation. Its inclusion enhances
tensile strength, reduces shrinkage, and improves water resistance, all while
promoting waste valorization. With proper processing and dosage optimization,
PALF holds considerable promise for sustainable construction in Uganda and other
tropical regions.




2.1.5 Stabilization by Concurrent Application of Bio-Enzyme and PALF
While The combined use of bio-enzymes and natural fibers such as Pineapple Leaf
Fiber (PALF) in clay brick stabilization presents a hybrid approach that leverages
both chemical and mechanical enhancements. While bio-enzymes such as
Terrazyme chemically modify the soil structure to enhance cohesion and density,
PALF physically reinforces the brick matrix by improving tensile strength and
mitigating crack formation. This synergy creates a stabilized product that is both
durable and sustainable, particularly suited for regions like Uganda with an
abundance of clay soil and agricultural waste.
Hybrid stabilization benefits from the complementary mechanisms of its
constituents. The enzyme treatment reduces the plasticity and water absorption
capacity of the soil by facilitating ionic exchanges and particle flocculation.
Simultaneously, the embedded PALF distributes tensile stresses, absorbs energy
during deformation, and reduces the development and propagation of shrinkage
cracks (Susilowati & Sumardiyanto, 2018). These effects collectively contribute
to greater durability, improved load-bearing capacity, and enhanced dimensional
stability of unfired clay bricks.
Empirical data supports the effectiveness of this hybrid method. Razman et al.
(2024) reported that bricks stabilized with 2–4% PALF and 100 ml/m3 Terrazyme
exhibited a 30% reduction in linear shrinkage and a 20–25% increase in compressive
strength compared to untreated controls. Additionally, water absorption was
reduced by over 15%, indicating higher moisture resistance and longer service life
in humid or rainy climates.



The inclusion of PALF also compensates for the potential brittleness induced by
enzymatic densification. While enzymes improve strength through soil particle
binding, they do not enhance tensile capacity. PALF addresses this shortcoming by
introducing ductility, which is crucial in resisting dynamic or fluctuating loads. This
makes hybrid-stabilized bricks particularly suitable for applications in non-loadbearing and moderately load-bearing walls in low-rise structures.
This technique also supports climate resilience. Unfired bricks often suffer from
degradation due to moisture cycling and biological growth. The dual stabilization
method reduces porosity and surface water retention, thereby lowering
susceptibility to algae, moss, and mold. Field simulations in East African
environments have demonstrated that hybrid-stabilized bricks maintain their
structural integrity after over 50 wet-dry cycles, a benchmark for long-term
performance in tropical climates (Kumar & Baser, 2016).
In terms of cost-effectiveness, hybrid stabilization reduces dependence on
expensive and energy-intensive materials like cement and lime. Both PALF and
Terrazyme are relatively inexpensive and can be produced or sourced locally. The
hybrid method also minimizes curing times and energy input, further reducing
production costs. This makes it ideal for rural construction initiatives, self-help
housing programs, and eco-village models where affordability and sustainability are
essential.


However, standardization remains a challenge. Optimal ratios for bio-enzyme and
fiber incorporation vary with soil type, fiber preparation method, and climatic
conditions. There is a need for more extensive studies to develop guidelines that
can be adapted for local use. Furthermore, training artisans and engineers on
proper mixing, curing, and quality control procedures is essential for ensuring
consistent performance.
In conclusion, hybrid stabilization using bio-enzymes and PALF offers a robust, ecofriendly solution for improving the engineering properties of unfired clay bricks. It
aligns with global goals for sustainable construction and offers a path forward for
resilient, low-cost, and environmentally responsible housing in Uganda and similar
contexts.
2.1.6 Conclusion
The hybrid method has, thus, demonstrated great potential in solving
environmental and engineering problems like dependency on firewood for kiln
operations, while simultaneously enhancing the mechanical properties of clay
bricks. Current literature postulates that the incorporation of bio-enzymes and
natural fibers, including pineapple leaf fibers, in the stabilization of clay bricks
provides a sustainable and eco-friendly intervention to solve problems in the
Ugandan construction industry. Of course, optimization of this formulation with
respect to the ratio of bio-enzyme and PALF, durability for a longtime, and
performance of stabilized bricks concerning different environmental conditions still
requires further research.
