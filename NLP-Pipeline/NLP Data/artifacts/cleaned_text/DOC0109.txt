ABSTRACT
Tebuconazole, a triazole fungicide is used for effective control of the fungal
pathogens in other crops. Little information regarding the use of tebuconazole
fungicide is known. Therefore, this study aims at evaluating the effect of
tebuconazole on growth of A. flavus and F. verticillioides in maize seeds. Completely
randomized design (CRD) with three replications was used to determine fungal growth
and changes in physical traits of maize seeds and the germination rate. Data was
collected on fungal growth (colonies, capping, and abnormal seeds) and seedling
growth. The results showed that was a significant difference (p< 0.004) among the
tebuconazole concentrations on the fungal growth, physical traits and germination
rate of maize seeds. The high dose had the highest normal seeds (72.65 ± 16.14a)
with the lowest number of abnormal seeds (23.47 ± 15.14c) and capping (5.13 ±
8.45ab) while Control had the lowest number normal seeds (50.57 ± 28.33c) with
highest number of abnormal seeds (44.40 ± 27.57a) and capping (7.94 ± 8.04a). White
fungal colonies were present in 100% of the samples across all treatments, high dose
was the most effective in reducing presence of yellow, green, grey and brown fungal
colonies. The highest germination percentage (96.67 ± 4.880c) was recorded in the
control while the recommended dose had the lowest germination percentage (63.33 ±
9.759a). Since, the recommended dose (0.5ml) of tebuconazole effectively controlled
the fungus, it is the most effective dosage for controlling of A. flavus and F.
verticillioides in maize seeds.

CHARPTER ONE
1.0 INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background.
Maize is one of the staple food crops for most of the population in African including
Uganda. Maize is the one of the most important cereal crops cultivated throughout
the year. It is used as feed (63.0%), food 23.0%) and in starch industries (12.0%), and
also widely used for the production of biofuels and industrial products. It is used in
manufacturing starch and glucose in industries dealing with poultry and animal feeds.
(Tang et al., 2022). The demand for starch consumption in food is growing at 10−12%
yearly. It has greater calorific value and rich in amino acids with less toxins compared
to grains like millet and broken rice. (Buyinza & Wambede, 2008)
Despite the economic importance of Maize, more than 60 diseases attack maize
during production and storage hence reducing the production and productivity of
maize. (Xu et al., 2023) Fungi are one of the principal causes of deterioration and
yield loss to maize farmers and seed companies during storage. Maize is susceptible to
contamination by aflatoxin, which are produced by fungi called Aspergillus flavus
(Sserumaga et al., 2020). During seed storage, the common fungal species include:
Aspergillus flavus and fusarium verticillioides. These fungus mostly affect seed
quality through production of mycotoxins that cause discoloration of seeds,
reduction in seed viability and germination where the mycotoxins can directly damage
the embryo leading to decreased germination rates and also increase susceptibility to
diseases which makes them more vulnerable to fungal diseases thus reducing quality
and yield in maize production.(Sserumaga et al., 2020) Aspergillus flavus thrives and



multiplies in storage areas with high moisture and temperature and it is a major
producer of aflatoxin which is a toxic secondary metabolites that pose serious health
risks to both humans and animals. (Mateo et al., 2017).Aspergillus flavus has L Morph
type with large sclerotia that produces fewer conidia compared to the S morph type.
The L morph type of Aspergillus flavus is the most prevalent type found in Uganda.
Aspergillus flavus colonies have varying appearances with green, yellow and black
mycelium. (El-Dawy et al., 2024) Aspergillus flavus destroys stored seeds causing loss
of viability which impacts the ability of the seeds to germinate successfully, and a
musty odor which indicates spoilage and potential health risks. The prevalence and
severity of aflatoxin in maize depend on the composition of Aspergillus populations
present. The toxigenicity of There are varying levels of aflatoxin in the Aspergillus
flavus strains where some strains produce high levels of aflatoxin while others
produce little or nothing hence the maize stored is affected by a specific strain
depending on its ability to produce the aflatoxin.(Massomo, 2020). Aspergillus ssp
produces different aflatoxin for example Aspergillus flavus produces B1and B2
aflatoxin while A.parasiticus produces G1 and G2 aflatoxin which is known as the most
potent in potent aflatoxin production.
The color colonies for fusarium verticillioides are pink, grey and white and it is the
most prevalent disease in the Ugandan maize exhibited with a genetic differentiation
from the strains that are in other countries. (Wokorach et al., 2021 The infection
caused by F.verticilliodes during the maize seed storage is severe and leads to high
levels of damage where it damages embryo and endosperm which causes low levels of
germination when the seeds are planted. (Moharana et al., 2020) It also causes other



symptoms like visible rotting on the seeds which affects their quality and produces
Fumonisin that are toxic to human health and the animals. The Fumonisin
contamination known as a group of mycotoxins. F. verticillioides causes visible rot
symptoms on stored seeds hence affecting their quality and produces fumonisins
known as a group of mycotoxins that pose serious health risks to humans and animals.
In addition, Uganda fusarium strains exhibit a unique haplotype diversity which leads
to a localized evolutionary patterns and adaptation. (Xu et al., 2023)
There are different methods of seed treatments to control fungal diseases which
include biological methods like use of trichoderma harzianum which can parasitize
and kill other fungi including Aspergillus and Fusarium. Physical methods like hot
water treatment where seeds are soaked in hot water to kill fungal spores on the seed
surface for a specific time and temperature and also seed sorting and selection where
damaged, discolored, or moldy seeds are removed visibly before storage to reduce
overall fungal load. Chemical seed treatments include: Carboxyl a systemic fungicide
that controls seed-borne diseases like smuts, Thiram a contact fungicide that protects
the seed surface from fungal infections and prodione a broad-spectrum fungicide
effective against a wide range of fungi, including Aspergillus and Fusarium. Chemical
seed protectants have been recommended for the control of seed borne diseases, but
have not been completely effective and can also cause phytotoxicity and negative
growth. The storage resistance of seeds that have been treated with saromyl
fungicide was used as a reference for maize storage seeds (Rahmawati and Aqil,
2021).



Tebuconazole is a triazole systemic fungicide that is used worldwide in the agriculture
sector to protect the crops from a variety of fungal pathogens. (Rajasekar et al.,
2015) Its efficacy it affected by the regional variation for example in India which is
subtropical, tebuconazole has shown significant efficacy against fungal pathogens
while in warmer climates , studies have shown resistance rates of up to 95% in treated
corn seeds under high dosages. (Smith et al., 2023). This research evaluated the
impact of different tebuconazole dosages on the growth of A. flavus and F.
verticillioides in stored maize seeds, as well as its effects on seed germination rates
and physical traits, to determine optimal application strategies in Uganda.
1.2 Statement of the problem.
Maize is one of the most important crops in Uganda that highly contributes to food
security and economic stability though its production and storage is greatly damaged
by fungal pathogens especially Aspergillus flavus and fusarium verticillioides. These
two fungi affect the quality of the seeds and also reduce its germination rates, they
also produce aflatoxin that are harmful to both humans and animals. Despite the
economic importance of maize to our country, the contamination caused by these two
fungi during maize seed storage still remains a significant challenge leading to post
harvest losses and reduced market value (Sserumaga et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2023).
Aspergillus flavus and Fusarium verticillioides are the predominant fungal species
affecting maize during storage in Uganda. These fungi thrive in warm and humid
conditions, which are common in the region, and their presence leads to seed
discoloration, reduced germination rates, and mycotoxin contamination (Massomo,
2020; Wokorach et al., 2021).



The control methods used include: Biological, physical and chemical methods that are
used to manage fungal growth. Tebuconazole, a triazole fungicide that is a chemical
method has shown efficacy in the control of the fungal pathogens in other crops and
countries. (Rajasekar et al., 2015; Gxasheka et al., 2020). However the effectiveness
of tebuconazole in controlling A.flavus and F. verticillioides in maize under the
Ugandan storage conditions is still not known though it is widely used in control of
fungal pathogens, there is limited information on its effectiveness in managing of
Aspergillus flavus and fusarium verticillioides. The optimal dosage of tebuconazole
for controlling these two fungi is not well established. There is lack of the
standardized dosage level with no negative effect on the germination and physical
traits of maize seeds (Tang et al., 2022).
There is a need to determine the efficacy of tebuconazole in controlling Aspergillus
flavus and Fusarium verticillioides growth in stored maize under Ugandan conditions.
Specifically, the optimal dosage of tebuconazole that effectively inhibits fungal
growth while maintaining or improving seed germination rates and physical
characteristics must be established though the impact of tebuconazole on seed
quality during storage needs to be evaluated to provide practical recommendations
for maize farmers and storage facility managers. (Sserumaga et al., 2020) This study
aims at evaluating the effect of tebuconazole on the growth of Aspergillus flavus and
fusarium verticillioides in the stored maize seeds and finding out the impact it has on
the germination rate and physical traits. This experiment will consist of varying doses
of tebuconazole in order to identify the optimal concentration that will effectively
control these two fungi growth without affecting the seed quality. The findings of this



study will provide a clear view on how to develop am effective seed treatment
strategy to mitigate fugal contamination in the maize seed storage in order to
improve food security.
1.3 Main objective.
 To evaluate the effect of tebuconazole on fungal growth and seed quality of
maize for effective management of fungal diseases and reduce the yield losses
caused during storage.
1.3.1 Specific objectives.
1. To assess the effect of tebuconazole dosage on Aspergillus flavus and Fusarium
verticillioides growth and physical traits in maize seed.
2. To assess the effect of tebuconazole dosage on the germination percentage of
maize seeds.
1.3.2 Hypothesis.
1. Increased dosages of tebuconazole reduce the growth of A. flavus and F.
verticillioides in maize seeds.
2. Low to moderate dosages of tebuconazole affect the germination percentage of
maize seeds negatively.
1.4 Significance.
The results of this study will provide scientific evidence for the efficacy of
tebuconazole in controlling local fungal growth and its impact on maize seed quality
during storage. The results will provide valuable information for policymakers and
regulatory agencies involved in setting standards for the use of fungicides in



agriculture. The study will also benefit maize farmers, food and feed industries,
researchers and extension workers by providing them with practical recommendations
for the safe and effective use of tebuconazole to prevent fungal contamination of
1.5 Justification.
Tebuconazole, a triazole fungicide has shown promising results in controlling a wide
range of fungal pathogens including Fusarium species in various crops. (Gxasheka et
al., 2020). Previous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of tebuconazole in
inhibiting mycelia growth of F. verticillioides and reducing fumonisin production in
vitro(Falca & Mycotoxin, 2011).However, there is a lack of information regarding the
use of tebuconazole as a seed dressing agent for maize in Uganda due to the varying
climatic conditions. This research will address this knowledge gap by investigating the
effects of different tebuconazole concentrations on fungal growth, specifically
targeting the dominant A. flavus and fusarium verticillioides. The study will also
examine the impact of tebuconazole on seed germination and other crucial physical
characteristics of maize seeds. The findings will provide a practical solution for fungal
control and the optimal dosage will reduce wastage and develop effective fungicide
application guidelines that will have no negative effect on maize seed physical
characteristics and germination rate valuable information for developing effective
seed treatment strategies.
1.6 Scope of the study.
This study will be conducted to evaluate the effect of tebuconazole on fungal growth
and maize seed characteristics and germination. The focus will be on maize seeds
treated with tebuconazole during storage. The study will be conducted at Makerere



agricultural research institute at kabanyolo. The fungi used in the study will be
isolated from maize samples collected from different storage facilities in Uganda.
1.7 Theoretical framework.
Dependent variables: Seed weight was assessed by using a weighing scale in grams.
The color of the fungal colonies growing on the seeds were assessed visually. Seeds
were visually assessed for any abnormalities including discoloration, shriveling and
rotting. Normal seeds are classified as healthy and had no signs of fungal growth or
any other physical damage. Capping were assessed visually by counting the number of
capped seeds. Germination percentage is determined by counting the number of
seeds that have germinated expressing this as a percentage of the total number of
seeds (10). (Moharana et al., 2020)
Independent variables : A range of tebuconazole concentration were used 0ml for no
control, 0.5ml as high dose, 0.6ml as recommended dose, 0.8ml as lower dose and
1.125 dose as reference dose. Distilled water was used to dilute the tebuconazole
fungicide.
Control variable: Light was controlled during the experiment in the laboratory.
(Moharana et al., 2020)







1.7.1 Conceptual framework.









CHARPTER TWO
2.0 Literature review.
2.1.1 Importance of maize
Maize (Zea mays) is a critical staple food for many populations worldwide,
particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, including Uganda. It serves as the most significant
cereal crop and a staple food for the majority of households, contributing over 40% to
total calorie intake through versatile consumption as fresh cobs, "posho," and
porridge, and as a key food source for institutions. Economically, it stands as the
primary income source for numerous farmers, especially smallholders, supporting the
livelihoods of over two million households, traders, and millers, and has evolved into
a major non-traditional export crop boosting foreign exchange and underpinning
industries like brewing and livestock feed. Agriculturally, maize is widely cultivated
across Uganda, predominantly by smallholder farmers who account for the majority of
production and marketable surplus, making it a government priority for enhanced
output. (Tang et al., 2022)
Aflatoxin contamination in maize in Uganda.
However, maize crops are highly susceptible to fungal infections, which can lead to
significant yield losses and pose severe health risks due to aflatoxin contamination
(Sserumaga et al., 2020). Aflatoxins, a group of carcinogenic and immunosuppressive
mycotoxins produced primarily by Aspergillus flavus, contaminate maize during
storage, especially in warm and humid environments. Several reports indicate
alarming levels of aflatoxin contamination in maize from various regions in Uganda,



leading to economic losses from trade restrictions and reduced market value
(Sserumaga et al., 2020).
2.1.2 Storage conditions for maize quality preservation.
Maintaining maize seed quality and preventing spoilage require adherence to specific
storage conditions. Proper post-harvest management is essential, with a target
moisture content of 13% recommended to inhibit fungal growth (Campos et al., 2015).
Well-ventilated storage structures, such as raised platforms, are crucial for promoting
air circulation and preventing moisture accumulation. Effective drying methods, like
sun drying, should be employed to remove excess moisture and prevent mold growth.
These practices reduce the risk of fungal growth and aflatoxin contamination during
storage (Campos et al., 2015).
2.1.3 Fungal community dynamics influencing aflatoxin contamination.
Aspergillus section Flavus communities are composed of diverse individuals exhibiting
varying phenotypic and genotypic characteristics (Sserumaga et al., 2020). The
composition of these communities significantly influences the incidence and severity
of aflatoxin contamination. Understanding the interactions and dynamics within these
fungal communities is crucial for developing effective control strategies. Factors such
as fungal strain, environmental conditions and agricultural practices can all impact
the prevalence and toxigenicity of Aspergillus species in stored maize (Sserumaga et
al., 2020).



2.1.4 Morphological and toxigenic variability in A. flavus populations.
Aspergillus flavus strains are categorized into different morph types, including the L
and S morph types. In Uganda, the L morph type is more prevalent, accounting for
approximately 6.66% of the A. flavus population (Massomo, 2020). The S morph type is
known to produce higher levels of aflatoxin compared to the L morph type, posing a
greater risk of contamination (Massomo, 2020).
2.1.5 Climatic drivers of fungal proliferation and aflatoxin production.
Climatic conditions play a significant role in the growth and aflatoxin production of A.
flavus. A relatively hot and dry weather with an optimal growth rate of around 31°C
favors fungal proliferation. High temperatures (exceeding 25°C) and high humidity
(above 70%) create conducive environments for the spread of infection and the
growth of aflatoxin (Marín et al., 2013).
2.1.6 Fusarium pathogens: Prevalence and genetic diversity in maize.
Fusarium verticillioides is another common fungal pathogen in maize, often found in
multiple haplotype groups (Marín et al., 2013). This pathogen is prevalent in Ugandan
maize, exhibiting genetic differentiation from strains found in other countries
(Wokorach et al., 2021). F. verticillioides can cause severe damage to maize seeds
during storage, leading to the production of fumonisins, which are toxic to human and
animal health (Moharana et al., 2020). The unique haplotype diversity of Ugandan
Fusarium strains indicates localized evolutionary patterns and adaptation, requiring
region-specific management strategies (Xu et al., 2023).



2.1.7 Deterioration of seed quality due to fungal colonization.
The invasion and growth of A. flavus in maize seeds result in a loss of seed viability
(Moharana et al., 2020). The fungus uses the seed's stored reserves as a food source,
leading to a decline in the seed’s ability to germinate. Fungal activity degrades the
seed's physical and biochemical composition, resulting in an overall decline in seed
quality (Moharana et al., 2020).
2.1.8 Musty odor development as an indicator of fungal activity.
The metabolic activity of A. flavus during its growth and colonization processes
produces volatile compounds, resulting in a musty odor (Moharana et al., 2020). These
compounds are byproducts of the fungus breaking down the seed’s components. The
presence of a musty odor serves as an indicator of fungal activity and potential
spoilage of stored maize. (Moharana et al., 2020).
2.1.9 Current control methods of A. flavus and F. verticillioides in maize seeds
Various methods exist for controlling fungal diseases in stored maize, including
biological, physical, and chemical approaches. Biological methods involve using
beneficial microorganisms like Trichoderma harzianum to parasitize and kill other
fungi (Xu et al., 2023). Physical methods include hot water treatments and seed
sorting to reduce the fungal load. Chemical seed treatments, such as carboxyl,
thiram, and prodione, have been used to control seed-borne diseases (Rahmawati and
Aqil, 2021). Tebuconazole, a triazole systemic fungicide, has shown promise in
protecting crops from fungal pathogens. It has curative and protective properties. It is
a large class of compounds that were developed in 1960s to solve the problem of
fungal growth which causes diseases in plants, it is widely used in agriculture sector



with the aim of protecting crops from a variety of fungal pathogens (Rajasekar et al.,
2015).
2.1.10 Tebuconazole: Efficacy, regional variations, and resistance.
Tebuconazole's efficacy is influenced by regional variations and climatic conditions. In
subtropical regions like India, it has demonstrated significant efficacy against fungal
pathogens (Rajasekar et al., 2015). However, in warmer climates, studies have
reported resistance rates of up to 95% in treated corn seeds under high dosages (Smith
et al., 2023) Fusarium species, particularly F. verticillioides, are highly prevalent in
Ugandan maize and exhibit significant genetic differentiation from strains in other
countries, evidenced by variations in the TEF-α1 gene sequence. (Wokorach et al.,
2021).
2.2 Identification of the fungal growth in maize seeds.
Capping: High number of maize seeds that were capped indicated high levels of fungal
colonization while lower number of capped seeds indicated low levels of fungal
growth. (Moharana et al., 2020). Fungal colonies: Presence of different fungal color
colonies indicated the presence or incidence of the fungal species. (Adolph, 2016)
Normal seeds: High number of normal seeds indicated tebuconazole effectiveness to
control fungal growth and maintain seed quality and lower number of normal seeds
indicated the resistance of fungal pathogens and changes in the seed quality.
Abnormal seeds: High number of abnormal seeds indicated the resistance of fungal
pathogens and changes in the seed quality while lower number of abnormal seeds
indicated tebuconazole effectiveness to control fungal growth and maintain seed
quality. (Moharana et al., 2020).



3.0 CHARPTER THREE
3.1 Specific objective 1. To assess the effect of tebuconazole dosage on A.flavus
3.1.2 Study site.
The study was conducted at Makerere University Agricultural Research Institute
Kabanyolo. MUARIK is located on spatial coordinates 0 ̊27'60''N, 32 ̊36'24'' E at an
altitudinal range of 1250 m to 1320 m above mean sea level. The study site is within
the administrative boundaries of Nangabo Sub County, Wakiso district and about 14
km north of Kampala, Uganda’s capital city. Kabanyolo is part of the Lake Victoria
basin that receives an average annual precipitation of 1218 mm and slightly drier
periods in June to July and December to February. The average annual temperature is
21.5 ̊C. (Makerere University et.at. 2025)
3.1.3 Materials.
Healthy maize seeds, tebuconazole fungicide, reference chemical (metalaxyl), 75
plastic tins, syringe, weighing scale and distilled water.
3.1.4 Experimental design.
Completely Randomized Design (CRD) with three replications for statistical validity
including treatment groups. (Moharana et al., 2020) Healthy maize seeds were
obtained from a maize storage facility.300g of maize seed was weighed for each
plastic tin using a weighing scale. Treatments were inoculated with the infected
maize seed except the control treatment group.



The tebuconazole treatments groups included; 0ml (control), 0.5ml (recommended
dose), 0.6ml (low dose), 0.8ml (high dose) and 1.125ml (reference dose) which were
diluted with distilled water (3ml). (Moharana et al., 2020)
The solution was mixed with the seeds, shaking manually in plastic bags for the
uniform distribution of the fungicide. The maize seeds were then placed in the
plastic tins to observe the fungal growth. Maize seeds in the tins were monitored for
fungal growth and changes in physical traits of the seeds every after 7days for a
month. (Moharana et al., 2020).

3.1.5 Data collection.
Data collected: Quantitative and qualitative data was collected.



Variables: Independent variable (tebuconazole concentration), dependent variables
(fungal colonies, capping, abnormal seeds and normal seeds), control variable (light)
A sample of 100 maize seeds were chosen to assess the number of abnormal seeds,
normal seeds and capping visually. The color of the fungal colonies growing on the
seeds were assessed visually. (Adolph, 2016). Seeds were visually assessed for any
abnormalities including discoloration, shriveling and rotting. (Moharana et al., 2020).
Normal seeds were classified as healthy and had no signs of fungal growth or any
other physical damage. (Moharana et al., 2020)
3.1.6 Data analysis.
Data was entered in excel then imported to Genstat 12edition for analysis. Descriptive
statistics was done to calculate mean and standard deviation for numerical variables
(normal, abnormal seed and capping), and for categorical variables (high dose, low
dose, reference dose, Control, and recommended dose. (Moharana et al., 2020). One
way ANOVA was done to compare means of dependent variables across different
treatment groups. This was followed by Duncan's multiple range test was used to
determine which treatments are significantly different from each other.

3.2.2 Materials.

Healthy maize seeds, tebuconazole fungicide, reference chemical (metalaxyl), 75
sterilized petri dishes, pipettes, gloves, cotton and distilled water
3.2.3 Experimental design.
Completely Randomized Design (CRD) with three replications for statistical validity
including treatment groups.
Healthy maize seeds were obtained from storage maize facilities. Maize seeds were
soaked in distilled water for 12 hours to improve germination.
Tebuconazole concentrations were prepared, low dose(0.5ml),high dose(0.8ml),
recommended dose (0.6ml) and reference dose (1.125ml) that were diluted with
0.3ml of distilled water. (Moharana et al., 2020). The maize seeds were treated,
apart from control group where the mixture and the seeds were put in polyethene bag
and shaken manually for uniform distribution of the fungicide.
Treated 10 maize seeds, apart from control group were placed in each petri dish.
Moist cotton was placed in the petri dishes where the treated seeds were placed. The
seeds were then covered with a black polyethene back to trap moisture and prevent
direct light from inhibiting germination. (Moharana et al., 2020)



Moisture of the cotton was monitored daily and watered to prevent inhibition of seeds
causing by drying of the seeds. The germination process took 7days. (Moharana et al.,
2020) (figure 1).
3.2.4 Data collection.
Data collected: Quantitative data was collected.
Variables: Independent variable (tebuconazole concentrations, distilled water),
dependent variable (germination percentage, root length and shoot length), control
variable (light)
The number of maize seeds that germinated were recorded after 7days using the
excel sheet.
Germination percentage was calculated by dividing the number of germinated seeds
by the total number of seeds in each petri dish, which expressed the result as a
percentage. The root and shoot length data was collected using a ruler in cm by
measuring the root and length of the seedlings. (Moharana et al., 2020)
3.2.5 Data analysis.
Data was entered in excel then imported to Genstat 12edition for analysis. Descriptive
statistics was done to calculate mean and standard deviation for numerical variables
(germination percentage, shoot length and root length), and for categorical variables
(high dose, low dose, reference dose, Control, and recommended dose. One way
ANOVA to compare means of dependent variables across different treatment groups
and correlation analysis to determine the relationship between germination
percentages, root and shoot lengths. Duncan's multiple range test used to determine
which treatments are significantly different from each other. (Moharana et al., 2020)

4.1.1 Effect of tebuconazole on fungal growth.
The results showed that there was a significant difference at p- 0.004 among the
dosages of tebuconazole on fungal growth on maize seeds (Table 1). White fungal
colonies were present in 100% of the samples across all treatments, suggesting
potential resistance to tebuconazole. The high dose of tebuconazole appeared to be
most effective in reducing the presence of yellow, green, grey, and brown fungal
colonies.

4.1.2 Effect of tebuconazole dosage fungal growth and appearance of physical
traits.
The results showed that there was a significant difference at p- 0.001 among the
dosages of tebuconazole on physical traits of maize seeds (normal seeds, abnormal
and capping) table 2. High dose of tebuconazole resulted in the highest number of
normal seeds (72.65 ± 16.14a) and the lowest number of abnormal seeds (23.47 ±
15.14c), hence there was effective control of fungal growth. The control group had
the lowest number of normal seeds (50.57 ± 28.33c) and the highest number of
abnormal seeds (44.40 ± 27.57a), hence there was significant fungal impact in the
absence of treatment.

CHAPTER FIVE
5.0 DISCUSSION.
5.1 For objective one: To assess the effect of tebuconazole dosage on A.flavus
The findings of this study confirm tebuconazole's effectiveness in reducing fungal
growth and maintaining the physical quality of maize seeds during storage.
Specifically, the high dose of tebuconazole led to a higher number of normal seeds
and a lower number of abnormal seeds, indicating effective control of fungal growth.
This aligns with previous research demonstrating tebuconazole's ability to protect
crops from various fungal pathogens. (Rajasekar et al. (2015) which shows that
tebuconazole's efficacy in protecting crops from fungal pathogens. However, the
consistent presence of white fungal colonies across all treatments, as observed in this
study, suggests potential resistance or the presence of non-targeted fungal species
which is the same observation that was reported in warmer climates with resistance
rates of up to 95% in treated corn seeds under high dosages. (Smith et al. 2023)
Implication.
Tebuconazole significantly affects the growth of A. flavus and F. verticillioides, as
well as the physical traits of maize seeds.
For objective two: To assess the effect of tebuconazole dosage on the
The results indicated that low to moderate dosages of tebuconazole (0.5–0.6 ml) had
minimal negative effects on germination percentage hence safe for seed viability.



This finding is consistent with the broader understanding that while fungicides can
protect seeds from fungal pathogens, they must do so without compromising the
seed's ability to germinate. However, the reference dosage (1.125 ml) negatively
impacted germination due to phytotoxicity which can damage the seed embryo and
inhibit germination. The same observation was reported regarding the importance of
establishing optimal tebuconazole dosages to avoid negative effects on germination
and physical traits of maize seeds where high doses of tebuconazole affected
germination with an incidence of 10-20% (Tang et al. 2022).
Implication.
Low to moderate dosages of tebuconazole have minimal negative effects on seed
germination and they are safe for seed viability.
Limitations.
The study observed white fungal colonies in 100% of the samples across all
treatments, suggesting potential resistance to tebuconazole or the presence of nontargeted fungal species.
The research did not include field trials in different environmental conditions and
with different maize varieties, which could limit the generalizability of the results.







CHAPRTER SIX
6.0 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.1 Conclusions.
The results from objective one for assessing the effect of tebuconazole dosage on
A.flavus and F.verticillioides growth and physical traits in maize seed showed that
there was a significant difference (<0.004) among the tebuconazole concentrations on
the fungal growth and physical traits of maize seeds, therefore I fail to reject my
hypothesis which states that increased dosages of tebuconazole reduce the growth of
A. flavus and F. verticillioides in maize seeds.
The results from objective two for assessing the effect of tebuconazole dosage on the
germination percentage of maize seeds showed that was a significant difference (<
0.004) among the tebuconazole concentrations on germination percentage, therefore
I fail to reject my hypothesis which states that low to moderate dosages of
tebuconazole affect the germination percentage of maize seeds.
6.2 Recommendations.
A recommended dose of tebuconazole (0.5ml) is recommended for usage due to its
effectiveness to control fungal growth and minimal effect on the germination
percentage.
Investigate long-term effects of tebuconazole on maize crop performance and explore
integrated approaches combining chemical and biological treatments.
Filed trials should be conducted in different environmental conditions and with
different maize varieties to ensure generalizability. The presence of white fungal



colonies across all treatments suggests potential resistance to tebuconazole hence it
is recommended to conduct further investigations to identify the specific fungal
species present and their susceptibility to tebuconazole.
