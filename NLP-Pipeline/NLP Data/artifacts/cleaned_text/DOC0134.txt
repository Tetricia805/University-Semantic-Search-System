ABSTRACT
This study examined the impact of leadership styles on employee performance at
Centenary Bank. The objectives of the research were to identify the different types of
leadership employed, assess employee performance levels, and propose strategies to
improve leadership practices and overall performance within the organization. The
study adopted a cross-sectional research design, targeting a population of 120
employees across managers, supervisors, and subordinate staff, with a sample size of
92 determined using Krejcie and Morgan’s (1970) table. Stratified random sampling
and simple random sampling techniques were employed to select respondents, while
data were collected using structured questionnaires. Both primary and secondary data
sources were utilized, with primary data capturing employee perceptions on
leadership styles transformational, transactional, democratic, autocratic, and laissezfaire and their effects on performance. Data were analyzed using descriptive and
inferential statistics, including frequencies, percentages, means, standard deviations,
and correlation analysis, and results were presented through tables, charts, and
graphs.
Findings revealed that transformational, transactional, and democratic leadership
styles were predominantly practiced, with transformational leadership having the
most significant influence on employee motivation, teamwork, innovation, and overall
performance. Autocratic leadership was moderately applied, while laissez-faire
leadership was least practiced. The study further identified strategies to enhance
leadership effectiveness, including regular leadership training, participatory decisionmaking, reward and recognition systems, open communication channels, and
mentorship programs. The study concludes that effective leadership positively
impacts employee performance and recommends that Centenary Bank strengthen
leadership practices to foster a motivated, productive, and committed workforce.
Future research is suggested on the role of organizational culture, employee
motivation, and job satisfaction in shaping leadership effectiveness.

CHAPTER ONE
1.0 Introduction
This chapter presents the background to the study, statement of the problem, purpose
of the study, objectives of the study, research questions, scope, significance of the
study, and limitations of the study.
1.1Background of the study
Leadership style refers to the approach and behavior that leaders adopt in guiding,
motivating,
and
influencing
their
employees
toward
the
achievement
of
organizational goals. It encompasses various dimensions such as decision-making
patterns, communication styles, and the degree of involvement given to subordinates
in organizational processes. Common leadership styles include transformational
leadership, which focuses on inspiring and empowering employees; transactional
leadership, which emphasizes clear structures, rewards, and penalties; and laissezfaire leadership, which involves minimal interference and autonomy for employees.
Employee performance, on the other hand, refers to the extent to which employees
effectively execute their roles and responsibilities to achieve set targets and
contribute to the overall productivity and success of an organization. High employee
performance is often characterized by efficiency, innovation, commitment, and
alignment with organizational objectives.
Numerous studies have established that leadership style significantly affects employee
performance and workplace behavior. For instance, Bass and Avolio (2004) noted that
transformational leadership enhances motivation, satisfaction, and innovation by
fostering a sense of purpose and professional development among employees.
Transactional leadership has been linked to the achievement of short-term goals
through structured supervision and reward systems (Judge & Piccolo, 2004), while
laissez-faire leadership, characterized by passive decision-making, is often associated
with reduced motivation and lower productivity (Skogstad et al., 2007). Robbins and
Judge (2017) emphasized that effective leadership goes beyond directing employees

to inspiring them, aligning leadership approaches with organizational values and
employee expectations. Similarly, Tyagi (2021) argued that leadership effectiveness is
critical for employee retention, engagement, and overall organizational productivity.
However, organizations, particularly in the banking sector, face practical challenges
in applying effective leadership styles that enhance performance. Leaders often
encounter difficulties such as managing diverse workforce expectations, resistance to
change, and maintaining high employee morale under strict regulatory and
performance pressures (Al Khajeh, 2018). Communication gaps between managers and
employees frequently lead to misunderstandings and disengagement, affecting overall
productivity (Iqbal et al., 2020).
Furthermore, leaders struggle with adapting their leadership styles to the evolving
workplace dynamics driven by technological change and increased competition
(Mwesigwa et al., 2021). High employee turnover and burnout have also been
reported as critical challenges, especially where leadership fails to foster a supportive
and motivating environment (Babalola et al., 2022). These challenges are particularly
evident in financial institutions like Centenary Bank, where leadership plays a crucial
role in influencing employee motivation, workplace commitment, and overall
productivity. This study, therefore, seeks to examine how different leadership styles
impact employee performance at Centenary Bank and explore strategies for
overcoming leadership challenges to foster better workplace outcomes.
1.2 Statement of the problem
Employee performance is a critical determinant of organizational success, particularly
in the banking sector, where service quality and customer satisfaction depend heavily
on employee motivation and engagement. At Centenary Bank, leadership styles
defined as the approaches leaders use to direct, motivate, and manage employees
(Northouse, 2018) play a crucial role in shaping workplace culture and influencing
performance outcomes. Transformational leadership, which inspires and motivates
employees through a shared vision and personal development, has been linked to
increased morale, creativity, and productivity. Similarly, democratic leadership,

which encourages employee participation in decision-making, fosters commitment,
job satisfaction, and retention. In contrast, autocratic leadership, characterized by
centralized decision-making and limited employee involvement, often results in low
morale and high turnover, while laissez-faire leadership, which provides minimal
guidance and oversight, can lead to disengagement and reduced productivity (Yukl,
2013). In Uganda’s competitive and customer-driven banking sector, understanding
how these leadership styles influence employee performance is vital for enhancing
motivation, improving service delivery, and promoting organizational growth.
1.3 Main objective of the study
The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of leadership styles on
employee performance, using Centenary Bank as a case study.
1.4 Objectives of the study
i.
To find out the different types of leadership at centenary bank
ii.

1.5 Research questions
i) What are the different leadership styles at Centenary bank?
ii) How do different leadership styles affect employee performance?
iii) What are possible ways leadership can be improved at Centenary bank ?
1.6 Scope of the study
1.6.1 Subject scope
The study explored the relationship between leadership styles and employee
performance
within Centenary Bank. Specifically, it examines how leadership
approaches such as transformational, transactional, autocratic, democratic, and
laissez-faire leadership influence employees' motivation, engagement, and overall
performance.
1.6.2 Geographical scope

The study was confined to Centenary Bank branch in Mukono. By focusing on a specific
institution, the research ensures a detailed and contextualized analysis of how
leadership styles influence employee performance across different departments and
branches of the bank.
1.6.3 Time Scope
The time scope of the study spans the past five years, from 2019 to 2024. This period
allowed for a contemporary analysis of leadership trends, recent changes in
management strategies, and their impact on employee performance, particularly
considering organizational responses to economic shifts, technological advancements,
and evolving workplace dynamics.
1.7 Significance of the study
The study on the impact of leadership styles on employee performance at Centenary
Bank provides valuable insights into how different leadership approaches affect
workplace morale, motivation, and performance. Understanding the specific
leadership practices that enhance performance can help Centenary Bank and other
financial institutions refine their leadership development programs.
The findings will be beneficial to policymakers within the banking sector, guiding
leadership training initiatives and human resource strategies to foster a more engaged
workforce. Additionally, scholars and researchers will find the study useful in
contributing to the existing literature on leadership and performance, particularly in
the context of Uganda’s banking industry.
By addressing the relationship between leadership styles and performance, this study
aims to provide practical recommendations that can enhance employee well-being,
reduce turnover, and improve overall organizational effectiveness.

CHAPTER TWO
LITERATURE REVIEW
2.0 Introduction
This chapter presents the literature review on leadership styles and employee
performance. It also deals with the actual review of literature that was done by
previous scholars objective by objective and the gap available in the literature of
previous studies. The rationale of the literature review is to discuss the existing
literature with the objective of revealing contribution made by earlier scholars,
weaknesses and gaps in existing knowledge and lessons learnt.
2.1 The different types of leadership
Transformational leadership is widely regarded as
one of the most effective
leadership styles because it emphasizes inspiring and motivating employees to achieve
their highest potential. A study by Hoch et al. (2018) revealed that transformational
leaders significantly enhance employee engagement and job satisfaction by providing
vision and fostering innovation. Similarly, Alonderiene and Majauskaite (2016) found
that transformational leadership positively correlates with organizational learning and
adaptability, especially in dynamic environments.
Research also shows its role in improving organizational performance. For instance,
Suong et al. (2021) examined Vietnamese SMEs and found that transformational
leadership positively influences innovation performance through knowledge-sharing

practices. Additionally, transformational leadership has been linked to increased
employee commitment and reduced turnover intentions (Choi et al., 2017). These
findings collectively suggest that transformational leadership enhances both individual
and organizational outcomes.
Transactional leadership focuses on structured tasks, rewards, and punishments to
achieve desired performance levels. Despite being considered less inspiring than
transformational leadership, it remains relevant in various contexts. According to
Breevaart et al. (2014), transactional leaders improve short-term performance
through clear goal setting and reward systems. Likewise, Podsakoff et al. (2018)
indicated that transactional leadership is effective in highly regulated industries,
where compliance and procedural accuracy are critical.
However, empirical studies reveal mixed results regarding its long-term effectiveness.
A study by Abbas et al. (2015) showed that while transactional leadership promotes
efficiency and goal achievement, it has a weaker association with innovation and
employee
creativity
compared
to
transformational
Therefore,
transactional leadership is most effective in stable environments requiring structured
performance management.
Servant leadership, which prioritizes employees' well-being and development, has
gained attention in recent years. Liden et al. (2015) demonstrated that servant
leaders enhance employee trust and organizational citizenship behavior (OCB).
Similarly, Eva et al. (2019), in a meta-analysis, reported that servant leadership
significantly improves team performance, commitment, and psychological safety.
In non-profit and educational settings, servant leadership has shown particularly
strong results. For example, Saleem et al. (2020) observed that servant leadership in
higher education institutions in Pakistan positively influences faculty motivation and
knowledge sharing. These findings indicate that servant leadership contributes to
sustainable organizational growth by emphasizing employee-centric values.

Democratic leadership, characterized by participative decision-making, empowers
employees and fosters inclusivity. Empirical research suggests that democratic
leadership positively affects employee morale and job satisfaction. According to
Hidayat and Nugroho (2020), democratic leadership in manufacturing firms led to
improved teamwork and reduced workplace conflict. Moreover, democratic leaders
facilitate innovation because employees feel valued and included in decision-making
(Nanjundeswaraswamy& Swamy, 2015).
However, democratic leadership is time-consuming and may not be ideal in crisis
situations where quick decisions are necessary (Jony et al., 2019). Despite these
limitations, its emphasis on collaboration makes it effective in knowledge-based and
creative industries.
Autocratic leadership involves centralized decision-making and strict control. While
often criticized for its rigidity, it remains useful in certain environments. For
example, Osei-Tutu et al. (2020) found that autocratic leadership enhanced
performance in military and security organizations where discipline and hierarchical
structure are essential. Similarly, research by Iqbal et al. (2015) showed that
autocratic leadership can be effective in high-pressure situations that require quick
and unilateral decision-making.
Nevertheless, studies indicate that autocratic leadership often leads to lower
employee satisfaction and higher turnover intentions compared to participative styles
(Hao &Yazdanifard, 2015). Hence, autocratic leadership may be contextually effective
but less suitable for organizations seeking employee empowerment and innovation.
Laissez-faire leadership, characterized by minimal leader intervention, has mixed
empirical support. Some studies indicate that it encourages creativity among selfmotivated employees (Skogstad et al., 2017). However, others associate it with
reduced performance and employee dissatisfaction when guidance is insufficient
(Harms et al., 2017).

For instance, a study by Yang (2015) found that laissez-faire leadership significantly
decreased team productivity and increased conflict when team members lacked
autonomy skills. Therefore, laissez-faire leadership tends to be effective only in
highly skilled, self-directed teams that require minimal oversight.
Empirical research highlights that different leadership styles impact organizational
outcomes differently depending on the context. Transformational and servant
leadership emerge as highly effective in fostering innovation, employee satisfaction,
and long-term growth. Transactional and autocratic leadership are effective in
structured, high-pressure environments but may limit creativity. Democratic
leadership enhances collaboration and inclusivity but may slow decision-making, while
laissez-faire leadership works only in highly autonomous teams. Leaders must
therefore adopt a situational approach, selecting styles that align with organizational
goals, workforce characteristics, and environmental conditions.
2.2Leadership styles and performance levels
Several studies have demonstrated that transformational leadership significantly
enhances organizational and employee performance. For instance, Alqatawenh (2018)
conducted an empirical study in Jordanian public sector organizations and found that
transformational leadership behaviors, such as inspiration, intellectual stimulation,
and individualized consideration, positively influence employees’ job performance.
Similarly, Pradhan and Jena (2017) found that transformational leadership has a direct
and positive effect on employee performance through the mediating role of job
engagement and motivation, confirming the critical role leaders play in inspiring
employees to achieve higher performance levels. More recent research by Al Khajeh
(2018) and Abasilim et al. (2019) revealed that transformational leaders create an
environment of trust and collaboration, which increases employee commitment and
productivity, ultimately improving organizational performance.
Transactional leadership, characterized by reward and punishment mechanisms, has
also been studied extensively in relation to performance. According to Yahaya and
Ebrahim (2016), transactional leadership significantly impacts task performance by

providing clear structures and performance-based rewards. In a study conducted by
Othman et al. (2020) among Malaysian manufacturing firms, transactional leadership
was found to positively influence operational performance metrics, including
efficiency and output quality, although its impact on innovation-related performance
was limited. Similarly, Aydin, Sarier, and Uysal (2019) revealed that transactional
leaders are effective in situations where employees require strict adherence to
procedures, which improves short-term performance but may limit creative problemsolving. These findings suggest that while transactional leadership can be effective in
performance optimization, it is context-dependent and may not foster long-term
innovative performance.
The emergence of servant leadership research has added a humanistic dimension to
leadership studies. Empirical evidence shows that servant leadership positively
influences both individual and organizational performance by focusing on the growth
and well-being of employees. Eva et al. (2019) conducted a meta-analysis and
concluded that servant leadership significantly improves employee performance by
fostering a supportive environment and building trust. Moreover, studies by Ling, Liu,
and Wu (2022) highlighted that servant leadership enhances team performance by
promoting collaboration, ethical conduct, and employee empowerment, especially in
knowledge-driven industries. These findings emphasize that leaders who prioritize the
needs of employees contribute to sustainable performance outcomes and long-term
organizational success.
Ethical leadership has gained prominence due to increasing attention to corporate
governance and ethical conduct. According to Bedi, Alpaslan, and Green (2016),
ethical leadership is positively associated with employees’ organizational commitment
and performance, largely due to increased trust and job satisfaction. Empirical
research by Khan et al. (2020) in Pakistani service firms confirmed that ethical
leaders foster an ethical climate, which mediates the relationship between leadership
and employee performance. Similarly, Neubert et al. (2021) found that ethical

leadership significantly influences employee creativity and organizational citizenship
behavior, which are vital components of overall performance in modern organizations.
These studies underscore that ethical leaders enhance performance by building
integrity and reducing unethical workplace behaviors.
Recent studies have explored leadership’s impact on performance within digitally
driven and remote work contexts. According to Dirani et al. (2020), effective
leadership during remote work settings, such as those necessitated by the COVID-19
pandemic, significantly determined employees’ engagement and productivity. Leaders
who adopted adaptive and inclusive approaches were able to sustain high
performance levels despite the challenges of remote work (Carnevale &Hatak, 2020).
Similarly, Wang et al. (2021) reported that digital leadership, which focuses on
technological adaptation and employee support in virtual environments, has become
increasingly critical for maintaining high organizational performance in post-pandemic
settings. These findings suggest that leadership styles must evolve to meet the
changing needs of digital workplaces to sustain performance levels.
In developing economies, leadership plays an even more critical role due to resource
constraints and challenging operating environments. For example, Odumeru and
Ogbonna (2018) in their study of Nigerian SMEs found that leadership style accounted
for a significant proportion of performance variance, with transformational and
participative leadership styles yielding superior results compared to autocratic styles.
Similarly, Onah and Okeke (2022) examined Ugandan financial institutions and
concluded that leadership practices focusing on employee development and
empowerment significantly improved both individual and organizational performance.
These studies emphasize that leadership effectiveness is context-specific and must
align with organizational resources and socio-economic conditions to optimize
performance outcomes.
Empirical evidence consistently demonstrates that leadership significantly impacts
performance levels across sectors and regions. Transformational, servant, ethical, and
adaptive leadership styles generally produce positive performance outcomes, while

transactional leadership is effective in structured and rule-bound environments. The
rise of digital and remote work environments has also necessitated new leadership
approaches to sustain performance levels. The reviewed studies indicate that leaders
who inspire, support, and ethically guide employees foster superior performance
outcomes, emphasizing the importance of dynamic and context-specific leadership
practices.
2.3 Possible ways to improve leadership and performance
Leadership development programs have been consistently highlighted as a key driver
in improving leadership effectiveness and organizational performance. According to
Avolio et al. (2014), structured training programs, including coaching, mentoring, and
experiential learning, significantly enhance leaders' competencies and decisionmaking capabilities. These programs enable leaders to develop emotional
intelligence, conflict management skills, and strategic vision, which are directly
linked to increased team productivity and organizational growth. Recent studies show
that organizations investing in continuous leadership training experienced a 17%
improvement in employee engagement and a 12% rise in overall organizational
performance (Brimhall, 2019). Furthermore, the shift toward digital training
platforms and virtual leadership programs during and after the COVID-19 pandemic
accelerated leadership skill acquisition, leading to adaptive leadership approaches in
dynamic environments (Lacerenza et al., 2021).
Transformational leadership, which emphasizes inspiring and motivating employees,
has been strongly correlated with improved performance outcomes. Leaders who
adopt transformational practices foster innovation, trust, and commitment among
employees (Bass & Riggio, 2019). A study by Khan et al. (2020) revealed that
transformational leadership significantly influences employee performance through
mediators such as job satisfaction and organizational citizenship behavior. Leaders
exhibiting transformational traits encourage creativity and collaboration, which drive
productivity in knowledge-intensive industries. Additionally, empirical evidence from
a meta-analysis of 95 studies indicated that transformational leadership accounts for

up to 20% of variance in employee performance across various organizational settings
(Hoch et al., 2018). These findings imply that leadership interventions focusing on
transformational behavior can yield sustainable improvements in performance
metrics.
Another avenue for improving leadership and performance is empowering employees
through participative decision-making and autonomy. Studies have shown that leaders
who adopt participative leadership styles and encourage employees to contribute
ideas achieve better performance outcomes due to enhanced employee ownership
and motivation (Zhang & Bartol, 2019). For example, Babalola et al. (2021) found that
participative leaders improve job satisfaction and reduce turnover intention, which
positively impacts overall productivity. Empowerment strategies such as shared goal
setting, transparent communication, and delegation of authority have been shown to
increase intrinsic motivation and creativity (Amundsen & Martinsen, 2015). A
longitudinal study by Xu et al. (2022) found that organizations adopting participative
leadership improved financial performance by 15% over three years due to higher
innovation and employee commitment levels.
The digital transformation of leadership practices has become a major trend
influencing organizational performance. Leaders are increasingly leveraging artificial
intelligence (AI), big data analytics, and virtual collaboration platforms to enhance
decision-making and performance management (Northouse, 2021). Empirical studies
reveal that technology-driven leadership, often associated with e-leadership,
enhances operational efficiency and team collaboration, especially in remote and
hybrid work environments (Contreras et al., 2020). For instance, a study by
Cortellazzo et al. (2019) indicated that leaders who effectively integrate digital tools
into their leadership practices experience improved team productivity and innovation.
Moreover, post-pandemic research shows that digital leadership directly correlates
with higher adaptability and resilience in uncertain environments (El-Said, 2023).
These findings suggest that technological adoption is a critical pathway for leaders
seeking to improve organizational performance.

Aligning leadership practices with organizational culture has emerged as an effective
approach to enhancing performance. Leaders who create a culture of accountability,
inclusivity, and continuous learning tend to influence employees’ attitudes positively,
resulting in improved performance outcomes (Schein, 2017). Empirical evidence
suggests that organizations with leaders promoting a supportive culture experience
30% higher employee engagement and 25% better retention (Groysberg et al., 2018).
Recent studies also emphasize the importance of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI)
initiatives in leadership, as inclusive leadership styles are strongly linked to creativity,
innovation, and reduced turnover (Shore et al., 2021). This indicates that fostering
inclusive cultural values and aligning them with leadership behavior can significantly
enhance organizational performance.
Finally, improving leadership effectiveness and performance requires integrating
robust feedback and performance measurement systems. Leaders who regularly
provide constructive feedback and performance appraisals foster continuous learning
and improvement among employees (London & Smither, 2019). Empirical studies
indicate that leaders utilizing data-driven performance monitoring systems
demonstrate
better
decision-making,
resulting
in
improved
individual
and
organizational outcomes (Pulakos et al., 2020). For example, Kerns (2021) found that
organizations that established regular performance dialogues between leaders and
employees reported 18% higher productivity levels and improved goal alignment.
These findings suggest that leadership approaches emphasizing feedback and
accountability mechanisms play a critical role in performance improvement.

CHAPTER THREE
RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
3.0 Introduction
This chapter outlined the research methodology that was employed in examining the
impact of leadership styles on employee performance in Centenary Bank. It covered
the research design, study population, sample size, sampling techniques, sources of
data, data collection methods, data collection instruments, data analysis and
presentation, and ethical considerations.
3.1 Research design
The study adopted a cross-sectional research design. This design allowed for the
collection and analysis of data at a single point in time from the selected
respondents. The design was suitable because it enabled the researcher to study
various leadership styles and how they influenced employee performance within the
bank without manipulating any variables.
3.2 Study population
The study targeted employees of Centenary Bank branches located in Kampala Central
Business District. The population consisted of 120 employees, including managers,
supervisors, and subordinate staff (Centenary Bank Human Resource Report, 2024).
3.3 Sample size
Given that studying the entire population was not practical due to time and resource
constraints, a manageable number of respondents was selected. The sample size was
determined using Krejcie and Morgan’s (1970) table, which recommended a sample
size of 92 for a population of 120.

3.4 Sampling technique
The study used stratified random sampling to ensure representation from different
employee categories, namely managers, supervisors, and subordinate staff. After
stratification, simple random sampling was used to select respondents within each
category, ensuring that every individual had an equal chance of inclusion. This
approach minimized selection bias and enhanced the representativeness of the
sample.
3.5 Sources of data
The study relied on both primary and secondary sources of data.
3.5.1 Primary data
Primary data was obtained directly from respondents using structured questionnaires.
This data was important because it provided firsthand information about employees’
perceptions of leadership styles and their impact on performance.
3.5.2 Secondary data
Secondary data was obtained by reviewing existing literature, including Centenary
Bank annual reports, published journals, books, and other relevant documents. This
data provided background information and support for the study findings.
3.6 Data collection instruments
The study used questionnaires as the main data collection instrument.
3.6.1 Questionnaire
The questionnaire consisted of both closed and open-ended questions designed to
capture data on leadership styles (e.g., transformational, transactional, and laissezfaire) and their impact on employee performance. Questionnaires were suitable

because they allowed for the collection of data from a relatively large sample within
a short period while ensuring anonymity and minimizing interviewer bias.
3.7 Data analysis and presentation
Collected data was checked for completeness, coded, and entered into the Statistical
Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) for analysis. Descriptive statistics such as
frequencies and percentages were used to summarize demographic data, while
inferential statistics such as correlation and regression analysis were used to establish
the relationship between leadership styles and employee performance. Results were
presented using tables, charts, and graphs for easy interpretation.
3.8 Ethical considerations
Ethical considerations were critical in ensuring the rights and well-being of
respondents were protected. The researcher sought informed consent from all
respondents, explaining the purpose of the study and assuring them of confidentiality
and anonymity. Participation was voluntary, and respondents had the right to
withdraw from the study at any time without penalty. The study avoided causing any
physical or psychological harm to participants and ensured that findings were
reported accurately and objectively (Saunders, Lewis, & Thornhill, 2009).

smaller proportion having completed Professional courses (7.7%).
The findings indicate that most respondents are fairly well-educated, with over 70%
possessing at least a bachelor’s degree or higher. This suggests that the study involved
participants with substantial academic backgrounds, which may positively influence
their ability to understand the study
The presence of respondents with diplomas and professional courses also adds
diversity to the educational profile, ensuring that perspectives from individuals with
different levels of academic and practical training are represented. This diversity can
help capture a more holistic view of the research topic.

Table 4.3 presents the work experience of respondents in relation to the study on
“The Impact of Leadership Styles on Employee Performance: A Case Study of
Centenary Bank.” The results show that the majority of employees (38.0%) have
between 6–10 years of experience, followed by 30.4% who have worked for 1–5 years,
while 20.7% have above 10 years of experience, and only 10.9% have less than one
year. This distribution indicates that most respondents have a considerable length of
service at Centenary Bank, with nearly 89.1% having over one year of experience.
Such a workforce is likely to have substantial exposure to the bank’s leadership
practices, enabling them to provide well-informed insights on how different
leadership styles influence employee performance.
Employees with longer tenure can better assess the effectiveness of leadership
approaches because they have experienced the bank’s organizational culture and
performance expectations over time. Moreover, the presence of newer employees
(10.9%) offers perspectives on how leadership styles impact staff motivation and
adaptation during the early stages of employment. Overall, the data suggests that the
findings on leadership styles and employee performance are based on a workforce
with diverse yet predominantly extensive experience, ensuring reliability and depth in
the responses.
4.3 Descriptive Statistics of the Study Variables
The study variables were analyzed using means and standard deviations. The mean
reflects the general trend of responses, while the standard deviation shows the extent
of agreement or variation among respondents. A low standard deviation (SD < 1)

indicates strong agreement among respondents, while a high SD (> 1) indicates mixed
opinions.

The results in Table 4.4 provide descriptive statistics on the leadership styles
practiced at the bank, using responses from 92 participants. The findings indicate
varying degrees of adoption for different leadership approaches.

The highest mean score (M = 4.45, SD = 0.517) was observed for transformational
leadership, implying that most leaders in the bank frequently inspire and motivate
employees to achieve organizational goals. This style is closely followed by
transactional leadership (M = 4.28, SD = 0.598), suggesting that leaders often use
rewards for good performance and corrective measures for underperformance. The
democratic leadership style (M = 4.20, SD = 0.621) also scored high, indicating that
leaders regularly involve employees in decision-making, which may promote
participation and job satisfaction.
On the other hand, autocratic leadership (M = 3.75, SD = 0.782) scored moderately,
suggesting that some leaders make decisions independently without much employee
consultation. The lowest mean score was recorded for laissez-faire leadership (M =
3.12, SD = 0.701), showing that a hands-off leadership approach is less common at the
bank. The overall average mean score of 3.96 with a standard deviation of 0.644
suggests that, on average, respondents agreed that a mix of leadership styles exists,
with a strong inclination toward transformational, democratic, and transactional
styles, which are likely to promote employee engagement and productivity.

respondents strongly agreed that effective leadership contributes positively to
employee performance. For instance, the highest mean score of 4.45 (SD = 0.501) was
recorded for the statement “Customer service delivery has improved due to effective
leadership,” indicating that leadership practices significantly enhance service delivery
to customers. Similarly, the statement “Teamwork and collaboration among
employees are encouraged” had a mean of 4.38 (SD = 0.538), suggesting that
leadership fosters teamwork, which is essential for productivity and efficiency.
Another notable result is the mean score of 4.31 (SD = 0.522) for “Employees meet set
performance targets consistently,” showing that effective leadership helps employees
achieve organizational goals.
On the other hand, the statement “Staff turnover rates are low due to good
leadership practices” recorded a relatively lower mean of 4.02 (SD = 0.694) compared
to the rest, implying that while leadership reduces staff turnover, other factors such
as remuneration and job satisfaction may also play significant roles. The statement
“Leadership promotes innovation and creativity at the workplace” scored a mean of
4.11 (SD = 0.622), indicating that leadership moderately supports innovation. The
overall average mean of 4.25 and standard deviation of 0.575 suggest that, on
average, respondents agreed that leadership positively influences employee
performance, with minimal variability in their opinions as shown by the relatively low
standard deviations across all items.

The findings reveal that employees strongly support various strategies aimed at
strengthening leadership effectiveness. The highest mean score (M = 4.55, SD = 0.517)
was recorded for introducing regular leadership training for managers, indicating that
employees believe equipping leaders with modern leadership skills is crucial for
effectively guiding and motivating teams. The low standard deviation reflects strong
consensus among respondents on the importance of this intervention.
Rewarding outstanding employee performance consistently ranked second (M = 4.48,
SD = 0.534), suggesting that employees view recognition and reward systems as
powerful motivators for boosting morale and productivity. Promoting open
communication between leaders and employees (M = 4.41, SD = 0.568) and adopting
mentorship programs to develop future leaders (M = 4.35, SD = 0.556) were also highly
rated, emphasizing the need for supportive and transparent leader–employee
relationships. Although encouraging employee participation in decision-making (M =
4.32, SD = 0.601) received the lowest mean score among the suggestions, it still
reflects strong agreement on its value for inclusive leadership practices.
The overall average mean score of 4.42 with a standard deviation of 0.555 suggests
that respondents widely agree on the importance of these strategies. Taken together,
the findings indicate that leadership training, open communication, reward systems,

mentorship, and participatory decision-making are essential for building stronger
leadership practices and enhancing employee performance within the organization.
CHAPTER FIVE
SUMMARY OF FINDINGS, CONCLUSIONS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS
5.0 Introduction
This chapter presents a comprehensive summary of the study findings, conclusions,
and recommendations based on the analysis carried out in Chapter Four.

5.1 Summary of Findings
The findings of the study indicate that Centenary Bank employs multiple leadership
styles, with transformational, transactional, and democratic approaches being the
most prevalent. Transformational leadership had the highest mean score, suggesting
that most leaders focus on inspiring, motivating, and guiding employees toward
achieving organizational goals. Transactional leadership, characterized by rewarding
good performance and enforcing discipline, and democratic leadership, involving
participatory decision-making, were also dominant styles within the organization.
Autocratic leadership was moderately practiced, while laissez-faire leadership was
least applied, indicating that leaders at the bank rarely adopt a hands-off approach.
The analysis also revealed that leadership styles significantly influence employee
performance at Centenary Bank. Findings showed that effective leadership practices
contribute to employees consistently meeting performance targets, improving
customer service delivery, fostering teamwork, and encouraging innovation and
creativity within the organization. Leadership practices were also linked to reduced
staff turnover, though respondents suggested that other factors, such as remuneration
and job satisfaction, could further enhance retention rates.
Furthermore, respondents proposed several measures to improve leadership and,
consequently, employee performance. These included regular leadership training for
managers,
rewarding
outstanding
employee
performance,
promoting
open
communication between leaders and employees, encouraging participatory decisionmaking, and adopting mentorship programs to develop future leaders. The findings
highlight that employees value leadership initiatives that prioritize skill development,
recognition, communication, and inclusivity.
5.2 Conclusions
Based on the study findings, it can be concluded that Centenary Bank applies a mix of
leadership styles, with transformational leadership emerging as the most dominant
approach. This indicates that leaders within the organization prioritize motivation,

inspiration, and vision-building,
which are essential for achieving long-term
organizational objectives.
The study also concludes that leadership practices have a significant positive impact
on employee performance. Employees in departments where leaders adopted
transformational, transactional, or democratic leadership styles reported higher levels
of productivity, improved customer service, better teamwork, and greater innovation
compared to those in units where autocratic or laissez-faire leadership approaches
prevailed.
Moreover, the findings suggest that there is room for improvement in leadership
practices at Centenary Bank. Specifically, initiatives such as regular training,
consistent reward systems, open communication platforms, and mentorship programs
could further enhance
leadership effectiveness and, consequently, employee
performance outcomes.
5.3 Recommendations
Respondents emphasized the need for continuous leadership training for managers to
improve their ability to inspire and guide employees effectively. They noted that
while transformational and democratic leadership styles are dominant, there is room
for growth in areas such as communication, participatory decision-making, and
innovation support. To address this, it is recommended that Centenary Bank organizes
regular leadership development programs focusing on modern leadership practices,
emotional intelligence, and change management. Such training would help managers
adapt to evolving organizational needs while fostering a culture of innovation and
employee engagement.
The study findings revealed that employees appreciate leaders who reward
outstanding performance and recognize their efforts. Respondents further suggested
that leadership practices alone might not fully address retention issues, pointing to
remuneration and job satisfaction as additional factors influencing employee

turnover. Based on this, it is recommended that Centenary Bank integrates structured
reward systems such as performance bonuses, employee appreciation events, and
career growth opportunities alongside competitive remuneration packages. This
approach would enhance motivation, improve job satisfaction, and reduce turnover
rates.
Respondents noted that open communication channels and inclusive decision-making
significantly improve employee morale, teamwork, and overall performance. They
highlighted the importance of leaders seeking input from employees when making
decisions that affect the workplace. To strengthen this, it is recommended that
Centenary Bank establishes formal platforms such as regular town hall meetings,
suggestion forums, and mentorship programs where employees can freely share ideas
and feedback. This participatory approach would promote transparency, inclusivity,
and a sense of ownership among employees, ultimately enhancing organizational
performance
5.4 Areas for further study
While this study has provided valuable insights into the relationship between
leadership styles and employee performance at Centenary Bank, future research could
focus on the role of organizational culture in shaping leadership effectiveness and
employee outcomes. Additionally, studies examining the impact of employee
motivation and job satisfaction on the relationship between leadership styles and
performance would offer a deeper understanding of how
to achieve optimal
organizational results. Comparative studies across different banks or industries could
also help generalize findings and identify sector-specific leadership challenges and
best practices.
