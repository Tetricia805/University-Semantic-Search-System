ABSTRACT
This paper examines and upholds infant baptism in the Church of Uganda within its biblical,
historical, theological, and pastoral context. It considers scriptural foundations such as circumcision and baptism, covenant promises, household baptisms, and Jesus’ welcome of children. It also surveys early Church history, showing that infant baptism was practiced and affirmed by figures like Irenaeus, Origen, Hippolytus, and the Council of Carthage. The study
engages objections from biblical interpretation, history, and theology, including concerns
about personal faith and freedom of choice. In response, it argues that baptism signifies
God’s covenantal grace rather than human decision, and that including children in the
Church’s sacramental life reflects Scripture and tradition. Highlighting theological, pastoral,
and missionary dimensions, the paper concludes that infant baptism remains both valid and
essential to the life and witness of the Church of Uganda.

Infant Baptism: Upholding its practice in the Province of the Church of
Uganda


Section I. Introduction
The Christian Church today is marked by a great diversity of denominations, each
interpreting and practicing the sacraments in different ways. Among the most debated is the
rite of baptism, particularly the question of whether it should be administered to infants or
reserved for adults. The former is referred to as infant baptism or paedobaptism and the latter
is called credo baptism.1
Infant baptism, also known as paedobaptism, is more than just a symbolic ritual. It is a sacramental practice that involves the practice of baptizing infants or young children. It has been
embraced by the majority of Christian traditions throughout history in an attempt to align
with the New Testament model of baptism of including children within the Church community.2 According to Ben. L. Rose, infant baptism is an acknowledgement of Church membership. The infant by this rite is accepted as a Church member, which is the Lord’s congregation, the household and God’s family.3 In this sense, baptism is less about the infant’s personal choice and more about God’s grace and the Church’s responsibility to nurture faith
Within the Reformed tradition, infant baptism is understood to be covenantal and promissory
in nature. The baptized child is included in the life of the church, but is not a full member of
the church until he or she is able to confess the faith, thereby claiming the promise of salvation offered in the rite of baptism. Things are rather different for those who come to faith later
in life and are baptized as believers (either as adolescents or adults). For in that case, there is
a clear relation between belief and the rite: one believes and is baptized. But in the case of
infants, it seems that faith follows baptism, often by some years. The idea is that the child is

baptized in the hope that she will own the faith confessed by her parents in due course, when
she reaches the age of reason4
The Province of the Church of Uganda, as part of the Anglican Communion in particular has
historically upheld the practice of infant baptism, and its significance remains unchanged
whenever it is performed on infants. The Church maintains that infants cannot be separated
from the divine plan of God and the Anglican rubric in the Book of Common Prayer, instructs
the church adherents:
That they defer not the baptism of their children longer than the first or second Sunday next
after their birth, or other holy-day falling between, unless upon a great and reasonable
cause, to be approved by the curate. And also they shall warn them, that without like great
cause and necessity they procure not their children to be baptized at home in their houses.
But despite its widespread practice, infant baptism has been without any doubt an objectionable issue for many years among many Christian denominations. Those that do not practice it
believe that infant baptism is not necessary due to their own way of interpreting the scripture.
They argue that infants are not capable of professing or confessing Jesus, and they maintain
the view that a conscious faith is required for baptism, while advocating for the baptism of
only adults capable of affirming their faith in Jesus.5 Others on the other hand, view infants
as sinless and therefore do not need baptism. This variation is a clear indication that there has
been a decline in the understanding of infant baptism especially among the evangelical
churches and this decline has been attributed to the influence of revivalism in evangelical cycles, and the emphasis on baptism which follows an individual’s profession of faith.6
This paper, therefore, aims to explain why the practice of infant baptism should be upheld
within the Province of the Church of Uganda by fostering a better understanding of it. It begins by introducing and defining the concept of infant baptism. It then examines the practice
in both the Bible and Church history. Furthermore, it evaluates the objections raised against

infant baptism from biblical, historical, and contemporary perspectives. Finally, it concludes
by presenting theological, pastoral, and historical arguments and those from silence, all in
support of infant baptism.

Section II. Infant Baptism in the Bible
The biblical basis for infant baptism is often drawn by analogy with the Old Testament practice of circumcision. God commanded Abraham to circumcise all male children in his household at eight days old as a sign of the covenant (Genesis 17:10–12). This covenant sign was
given before a child could profess faith, showing that God’s promises extended even to infants. Christ himself underwent circumcision at eight days old (Luke 2:21). Wayne Vogt argues that this replacement of circumcision with baptism is one of the strongest supports for
infant baptism.7

Paul makes a theological connection between circumcision and baptism in Colossians 2:11–
14. He speaks of the “circumcision of Christ” (his death on the cross) and explains that believers were “buried with him in baptism and raised with him.” This highlights the continuity
between circumcision and baptism as covenant signs, each pointing to God’s work of grace
and the believer’s inclusion in His covenant family, as explained further below.
Both circumcision and baptism are covenant signs, outward badges of belonging to God’s
family. In the Old Testament, circumcision marked Israel as God’s people, while in the New
Testament; baptism marks those in Christ’s covenant community. Neither act itself creates
the relationship with God but points to the deeper reality of belonging to Him.
Both signify inclusion. Circumcision was given to Israelite boys shortly after birth, showing
they were part of God’s people from the start. In the same way, infant baptism brings children
into the visible Christian community under God’s promises, even before they can express
faith.

Valley View University, Ghana, Theological Seminary, Adventist University of Africa, Kenya. p.21



Both are linked to faith. Abraham’s circumcision was called a seal of the righteousness that
comes by faith (Romans 4:11). Baptism also points to faith and union with Christ—
confirming belief in adults and expressing trust that infants will grow into covenant faith.
Both symbolize cleansing. Circumcision hinted at the need for a purified heart, turning from
sin toward God. Baptism makes this imagery clearer, as water signifies washing away sin and
beginning new life through the Holy Spirit.8 Circumcision was intended for the children of
believing parents. Through Jesus Christ, baptism now serves as the replacement for circumcision. Consequently, baptism remains for the children of believing parents, as well as for new
adult believers.9.


The Great Commission provides another foundation. Jesus commanded his disciples: “Go
and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and
of the Holy Spirit” (Matthew 28:18). Since children are part of “all nations,” this passage is
understood to include them. Nowhere in Scripture does Jesus forbid the baptism of children.
As Wayne Vogt points out, those who oppose infant baptism cannot cite any biblical text excluding them. Similarly, in Mark 16:16, belief and baptism are linked with salvation, but
children are not exempted from this promise.


The practice of infant baptism finds another basis in the household or oikos formula.
According to Wayne Vogt, this formula offers strong evidence. The New Testament contains
various references to the baptism of entire households (Acts 16:15, Acts 16:33, 1 Corinthians
1:16). It is assumed that such household baptisms would encompass infants and children.
Another significant basis is found in the household or oikos formula. According to Wayne
Vogt, this formula offers strong evidence. The New Testament contains various references to
the baptism of entire households.Examples include Lydia (Acts 16:15), the Philippian jailer

(Acts 16:33), and Stephanas (1 Corinthians 1:16). In the Old Testament, when a household
entered covenant relationship with God, children were included through circumcision. By
parallel, it is assumed that New Testament household baptisms also included infants and
children.10



Peter’s sermon at Pentecost reinforces this covenant continuity: “The promise is for you and
your children and for all who are far off” (Acts 2:38–39). This indicates that God’s promises
extend to children as well as adults. Similarly, Paul in 1 Corinthians 7:14 teaches that the
children of believers are “holy,” meaning set apart to God. If God regards them as holy,
withholding baptism would contradict their covenant status..


Finally, the attitude of Jesus himself provides support. In Matthew 19:13–15, Jesus welcomed
little children, took them in his arms, and blessed them, despite the disciples’ attempts to turn
them away. Though not directly about baptism, this passage demonstrates Christ’s willingness to receive and bless children, even before they could understand. If Jesus blessed them,
it follows that the Church should also recognize their inclusion in God’s covenant community
through baptism. 11

Section III. Infant Baptism in History
It is a well-established fact that infant baptism has been widely practiced in the majority of
Churches since at least 250 A.D. While not all scholars agree that it existed in the earliest
years of the Church, several historical records prior to that date indicate that the baptism of
infants was already common in the first and second centuries.12
One of the earliest witnesses is Irenaeus, who, writing before his death around 200 A.D., affirmed: “For He (the Lord) came to save all through Himself—infants, little children, boys,
youths, and the elderly—who through Him are born again in God.” This statement implies
that baptism, as the means of new birth, was extended to infants. As Vogt observes, Irenaeus
was a student and close friend of Polycarp, who himself had been a disciple of the Apostle
John. Thus, less than a century separated Irenaeus from the apostolic age, and his testimony
carries significant weight. Moreover, Irenaeus was widely regarded as one of the most doctrinally sound teachers of his time.
A generation later, Origen, who died around 250 A.D., wrote, “The church received from the
apostles the tradition to give even little children to baptism.” This statement shows that he
regarded infant baptism as an established practice dating back to the apostles, and he felt no
need to argue for it.
Also, Tertullian, who died around 225 A.D., while not dismissing infant baptism as invalid
after having written extensively on baptism, advised delaying its administration. His concern
was that baptized children, and particularly their sponsors, might fail to fulfill their commitments. He wrote: “Let them (children) come when they are older; let them come when they
are able to learn and be taught whether they should come; let them become Christians when
they can truly know Christ” 13

Tertullian’s advice to delay baptizing infants shows that the practice was already common in
his time. His writings also make it clear that infant baptism was not something new, otherwise, he probably would have criticized it for being a recent invention. Since he never made
that argument, it suggests that infant baptism was already an accepted tradition, not something the Church or the Apostles had just introduced.
Another important witness, Hippolytus, writing around 215 A.D., stated: “First you should
baptize the little ones. Those who can speak for themselves should do so, but for those who
cannot, their parents or another family member should speak. Then baptize the grown men,
and lastly the women” (Apostolic Traditions, 21, 4f). This order of baptism demonstrates that
the baptism of infant was common in his time. To deny this would require an unusually
strained line of reasoning.
Finally, around 250 A.D., Bishop Fidus raises a question to the Council of Carthage
regarding whether baptism should be postponed until the eighth day. The council concluded
that it should not be delayed arbitrarily (Epistle 64, 2-6). The very terms of the discussion
reveal that infant baptism was already widely practiced and uncontested at that time. There
was no serious debate over whether infants should be baptized; it was universally accepted.
The only issue under discussion was whether baptism should follow the eighth-day timing
prescribed for Old Testament circumcision. Following that council, a considerable body of
evidence shows that infants were regularly baptized, so much so that even those who opposed
the practice did not deny that it was common after 250 A.D.14




Section IV. Objections to Infant Baptism in the Bible
Opponents of infant baptism often appeal to New Testament passages such as Romans 6:3–4,
1 Corinthians 12:13, Galatians 3:27–28, and Colossians 2:11–12. Their argument is that
baptism in Scripture is consistently tied to personal faith in Christ, and therefore only those
who consciously believe should receive it.15

From this perspective, baptism according to them serves as a visible sign of a believer’s
personal trust in Christ and commitment to follow Him. It symbolizes what has already
taken place inwardly—repentance, faith, and new life through the Spirit. Without genuine
faith, baptism loses its meaning and becomes an empty ritual. For this reason, baptism should
only be administered to those who have consciously embraced the gospel and can publicly
confess Christ as Lord.

In line with this reasoning, these critics also emphasize that these passages portray baptism as
a symbol of purification from sins, a cleansing that can only be received through faith in
Jesus Christ. Since infants are not capable of exercising personal faith or repentance, they
cannot yet experience the reality that baptism is meant to signify. To baptize those who do
not believe reduces the ordinance to a mere ritual without the saving reality it represents.
Therefore, baptism should be reserved for those who personally believe in Christ, because
only they can experience the forgiveness and cleansing that the sacrament points to.16
Furthermore more, opponents of infant baptism raise several objections based on passages
commonly cited in its support. Their argument is that these texts, when read carefully, point
to baptism following personal faith rather than its extension to infants. The following is a
summary of Objections to Infant Baptism in Key Passages.
Acts 2:38–39

Paedobaptists interpret Peter’s words, “the promise is for you and your children,” as including infants. Critics, however, respond that the promise is not restricted to children of believers but extends to “all who are far off,” that is, everyone “whom the Lord our God will call.”
If this call refers to the outward preaching of the gospel, it applies to all hearers; if it refers to
the inward call of God, it applies only to the elect. Furthermore, Acts 2:41 clarifies that
“those who received his word were baptized,” implying conscious acceptance of the message.
Thus, baptism here is reserved for believers, not infants.17

Colossians 2:11–12

17 Greg Welty. A Critical Evaluation Of Infant Baptism pp16-17




Advocates of infant baptism often claim that baptism in the New Testament replaces circumcision in the Old Testament and should therefore be administered to infants. Critics, while
acknowledging a parallel between the two rites, argue that Paul’s focus is different. He explicitly links baptism with spiritual renewal: the putting off of the sinful nature and being
raised with Christ through faith. Since infants cannot exercise such faith, this passage is seen
as affirming believer’s baptism rather than infant baptism.
Household Baptisms in Acts
Several accounts of household baptisms are cited in defense of infant baptism. Yet opponents
argue that in every case, baptism follows personal faith. For instance, in Acts 16:32–34, the
Philippian jailer’s entire household first heard the gospel, and then believed, rejoiced, and
were baptized together. Critics conclude that the household baptisms demonstrate a consistent
pattern of baptism based on belief, not indiscriminate application to infants.
1 Corinthians 7:14

Paedobaptists sometimes argue that children of at least one believing parent are “holy” in a
covenantal sense and therefore eligible for baptism. Critics respond that Paul uses the same
term “holy” for the unbelieving spouse, showing that holiness here is relational, not covenantal. The child’s holiness arises from association with a believing parent, not from a covenant
status that warrants baptism. Applying the verse only to children while excluding the unbelieving spouse is, in their view, a misinterpretation.18

In summary, critics contend that the passages often cited to support infant baptism instead
emphasize baptism as a response to personal faith. They argue that applying these texts to
infants misrepresents their meaning and does not align with the New Testament pattern of
baptism for believers.

Section V. Objections to infant Baptism in history and contemporary.
Objections in History:

The practice of baptizing infants was the normal tradition of the Church and was not
seriously questioned until the time of the Reformation. Earlier, in the fourth century, some
Church leaders such as Basil, Ambrose, Chrysostom, Jerome, and Augustine postponed
baptism until later in life. For them baptism was viewed less as a sacrament of incorporation
into the Church and more as a sacrament of pardon.19 From the tenth to the thirteenth century,
the Neo-Manicheans objected to infant baptism on the grounds that infants could not yet
believe. They appealed to a literal reading of Mark 16:16: “He who believes and is baptized
will be saved; he who does not believe will be condemned.” Since infants cannot believe,
they argued, they could not receive baptism validly.20
At the time of the Reformation these concerns reemerged with new force. In 1523 Andreas
Bodenstein von Karlstadt began advocating that baptism should be delayed until a child could
understand its meaning. Soon afterward, in places such as Wytikon and Zollikon, parents
refused to have their infants baptized, preferring instead to wait until their children reached
maturity and could choose sponsors for themselves. This rejection of infant baptism, and the
demand that baptism be given only to believers, gave rise to the nickname “Anabaptists” or
“rebaptizers,” a movement that became a defining mark of the Radical Reformation.21
From that point on, infant baptism became one of the most objectionable practices in the
Western Church. To the Anabaptists it was even a scandal, while in later centuries some Baptists, in reexamining their own tradition, began to question their rejection of infant baptism
and their practice of rebaptizing converts
Contemporary Objections:
Although theology guarantees the ex opere operato validity of infant baptism, its practice
continues to raise concern today. The renewal of both theology and pastoral life, together

with recent Protestant objections, have pushed this issue into focus. What is at stake is not
only a right understanding of baptism but also the very missionary nature and mission of the
Church. And while this debate is most evident in countries where Christian influence is fading, the Church in Uganda, too, cannot afford to ignore it.22 Some of the current objections to
the practice of infant baptism are as discussed below:
To begin with, some people argue that baptizing infants limits their personal freedom. They
claim it undermines the dignity of the child to place upon them religious obligations they
might one day choose to reject. From this perspective, baptism should be delayed until a person is old enough to make a free and conscious commitment. Until then, parents and teachers
should avoid influencing the decision.23
In addition, critics point to the pastoral origins of the practice, claiming that it reflects more
concern with administering sacraments than with stirring faith or promoting evangelization.
Critics maintain that by retaining infant baptism, the Church prioritizes numbers and social
establishment over true missionary outreach. This, they argue, fosters a “magical” understanding of the sacraments, whereas what is really needed is an approach that nurtures conscious faith, supports genuine personal commitment, and positions baptism within a gradual
process of spiritual growth.24
Another concern, raised by Alister E. Mc Grath (529) in his book, 'Christian Theology' brings
out Karl Barth's argument on the significance of infant baptism that the practice weakens the
central link between baptism and Christian discipleship. He emphasizes that baptism is a
witness to the grace of God, and makes the beginning of the human response to the grace and
that infants cannot meaningfully make this response.25
Further objection, presented by Richard Kenneth Atkins (8) in his article, ‘Peirce’s Modal
Defense of Infant Baptism', raises the obvious Baptist's view that a baptized infant does not

become regenerate or reborn “until he actually has those Feelings” that bring about
regeneration or rebirth no matter how much water the child’s head is sprinkled with.
Finally, Balthasar Hubmaier in the book by Wayne Pipkin, 'The Baptismal Theology' urges
that Baptism of infants is not real baptism, even if the Trinitarian name of God is used, for
"baptizing in the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit takes place when a
person first confesses that he is a sinner and guilty, when he then believes in the forgiveness
of sins through Jesus Christ and therefore resolves from now on to live according to the Rule
of Christ as far as God the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit will give him grace and
strength".26
In conclusion, though the objections differ, whether theological, pastoral, sacramental, or
related to discipleship and personal faith, they all share the same concern: that baptizing
infants weakens the link between baptism and personal belie
Section VI. In support of infant Baptistism
Despite widespread criticism, infant baptism rests on strong foundations and is supported by
several convincing reasons. The arguments discussed below approach the practice from biblical, historical, pastoral, and theological perspectives, including arguments from silence, in
response to the objections raised above.
The critics’ view of baptism that looks at it as a visible sign of a believer’s personal trust in
Christ and commitment to follow Him, as seen in the New Testament, ends up being focused
mainly on people rather than on God. It makes baptism mean only a response to an inward
change, instead of a sign of God’s grace. But covenant signs, like baptism, are signs of God’s
covenant of grace. They are about His gracious promise, not about our personal commitment.
Just as circumcision was a sign of God’s covenant promises, baptism is also a sign of God’s
faithfulness in Christ. Through baptism, God promises salvation to the believer. However, if
a child grows up and never responds in faith, that same covenant brings judgment instead of
blessing.
Covenant signs are not just individual but also communal—they mark a person as belonging
to the covenant family, the people of God. Baptism is less about someone declaring their
personal decision and more about being set apart to God within the believing community.

26 Wayne Pipkin .The Baptismal Theology of Balthasar Hubmaier H. pp41-42


This is why infant baptism serves as an important correction to the strong individualism that
has shaped many churches today

The argument that baptism symbolizes purification from sins, as seen in Tit. 3:5 and 1 Cor.
6:11 is agreeable to me. But this does not mean that only those who already believe should be
baptized. The sign of baptism should not be confused with the actual reality it points to.
Children of believers are baptized with the hope that, in time, they will come to faith and
receive the true purification from sin. If we reject this, we would also have to reject
circumcision in the Old Testament. Circumcision also symbolized the removal of sin and
being set apart to serve God, yet it was given to infants. For that reason, it makes sense that
infants can be baptized too. 27
While the critics argue that Acts 2:39 does not give a covenant promise to children, the text
itself shows otherwise. Peter explicitly says, “The promise is for you and for your children.”
This deliberate inclusion demonstrates continuity with God’s covenant dealings in the Old
Testament, where children were always included within the covenant community and
received the covenant sign. Far from abolishing this principle at Pentecost, Peter reaffirms it,
showing that children remain within the covenant community. The call to repentance and
faith applies to all, but the covenant sign (baptism) is still placed on believers and their
children, just as circumcision had been. Thus, Acts 2:39 supports, rather than excludes the
baptism of covenant children.

The objection raised against infant baptism in Colossians 2:11–12 focuses only on personal
faith and inward transformation, thereby excluding infants from baptism. However, Paul’s
point is not to separate circumcision from baptism but to show that both point to the same
reality—Christ’s death, burial, and resurrection. Circumcision looked forward to what Christ
would accomplish, while baptism looks back to what He has accomplished. Since
circumcision was given to infants as a sign of belonging to God’s people, and Paul directly
connects it with baptism, it follows that baptism should also be given to infants.28

28 Jason Helopoulos .The Controversy about Infant Baptism. January 4, 2018.



One important line of evidence in support of infant baptism comes from the biblical accounts
of entire households being baptized together.
The New Testament records several instances where baptism was administered to whole
households. For example: Lydia: “She was baptized, and her household” (Acts 16:15), The
Philippian Jailer: “He and his entire household were baptized” (Acts 16:33) and the Household of Stephanas: Paul writes, “I did baptize also the household of Stephanas” (1 Corinthians 1:16).
In each case, the text emphasizes the inclusion of the entire household rather than specifying
only adult believers.
While the biblical texts do not specify the ages of the household members, it is improbable
that these households were composed only of adults. In the cultural context of the first century, households typically included not only parents but also children, extended family, and
servants with their children. Thus, the natural reading of “household” would reasonably include infants and young children.
Admittedly, these passages do not directly prove that infants were baptized. But they do make
the practice very possible. Since whole households were baptized without any limits mentioned, it makes sense to believe that children, even infants, were included. When this is
combined with other biblical and theological reasons, household baptisms give strong support
for infant baptism.29
In 1 Corinthians 7:14, Paul makes a clear distinction between the unbelieving spouse and
the child of a believer. The unbelieving spouse is said to be “sanctified” through the believer,
but he describes the children of one believing parent as “holy.” This difference in wording
and emphasis indicates that Paul is not equating the two in the same way. The child is
declared holy based upon the parent’s faith and trust in the Lord. Paul is not speaking here of
subjective inward holiness, but to objective holiness. That is, he is speaking of holiness
regarding connection and privilege. The children are holy because they are being raised in a
home under the guidance of holiness and the teachings of Christ. This means that such a child
is set apart and included in the community of God’s people and as a result, they are not to be

regarded as “unclean” (as those outside the covenant). And that is exactly why the church has
historically recognized them as rightful recipients of the covenant sign of baptism.30



In response to the historical objections, infant baptism has been widely practiced and justified
within the Church from its earliest centuries. Even before Augustine, baptism was understood
as the forgiveness of sins, which initially raised questions regarding infants, who had committed no personal sin. Early Church leaders, however, defended the practice. Chrysostom,
for instance, explained that infants are baptized so that they may receive justice, adoption,
inheritance, and grace—becoming members of Christ and temples of the Holy Spirit. Baptism
was therefore seen as the means by which children were incorporated into the covenant
community from the very beginning of life.
Over time, theologians sought to explain how baptism could be applied to those unable to express personal faith. Augustine and later scholars argued that the faith of the Church compensates for the infant’s lack of personal faith, a view that was further developed by Peter
Lombard through the distinction of munus and usus—habit and act of faith. Historical figures such as Aquinas and Bonaventure synthesized these ideas, showing that the Church’s
faith prepared the infant for baptism, and the sacrament itself communicated this faith to the
child.
The historical acceptance of infant baptism was confirmed and reinforced through councils
and official Church declarations. The Council of Vienne in 1312 recognized the doctrine as
probable, while the Council of Trent formally affirmed that baptism confers all theological
virtues, including faith. Subsequent statements, including those at Florence, the 20th-century
Monitum, and Pope Paul VI’s Credo, demonstrate the Church’s consistent defense of infant
baptism across the centuries.
Even during the Reformation, when groups such as the Anabaptists rejected infant baptism,
the practice was widely upheld by both Catholics and most Protestant traditions, showing its
broad historical continuity. This enduring practice reflects the Church’s longstanding view

that infants belong fully within the covenant community and that baptism has been an essential means of initiating them into the life of the Church throughout history.
The idea that baptism restricts a child’s freedom is a misconception: No one is completely
free from influence. Even naturally, parents make decisions that are crucial for their child’s
life and moral formation. Even choosing not to guide a child’s religious life is itself a choice,
one that may withhold something important.
Baptism does not take away freedom. Every person has responsibilities to God, and baptism
recognizes these while welcoming the child as God’s own. The New Testament presents joining the Christian life not as forced, but as the way to true freedom.
A child might later resist the duties of baptism. This can be painful for parents, but it does not
mean they were wrong to baptize and raise the child in faith. Even if faith seems dormant, the
seeds planted can grow later, nourished by the parents’ love, prayers, and faithful example.31
The objection that infant baptism undermines evangelistic passion and reduces baptism to
mere ritual misses the richer meaning of the practice. While the Church indeed seeks to
awaken faith and encourage mature discipleship, the sacrament’s necessity applies equally to
children, who are baptized not by personal profession but within the faith of the Church. Far
from being a concession to numbers or social establishment, infant baptism reflects the
Church’s duty to extend Christ’s saving grace universally, incorporating even children into
His body. It is, in fact, deeply missionary, showing that salvation begins with God’s free initiative: “He first loved us” (1 Jn 4:19), and “He saved us... through the washing of rebirth
and renewal by the Holy Spirit” (Tit 3:5). Far from diminishing missionary zeal, baptizing
infants proclaims God’s mercy from the very start of life and commits the Church to fostering
that gift toward mature faith.32
Barth’s objection to the practice of infant baptism could limit how much God's grace can
reach. This is because infant baptism shows that God's grace is there even before a person
cannot understand it. This means that God's grace comes first, even before someone can
decide to follow Him. If we only focus on baptizing people who can understand and respond

to God, this might make us underestimate God’s grace which is available for all including
infant despite of their inability to respond to it.
The view by Kenneth is contradictory to the orthodox view which is being held by many that
“an infant is Regenerate when his sponsors at the font have promised that his mind shall receive that Christian nurture which will insure his ultimately having the Feelings, at least, and
valuations of Feeling, that are about all that is common to all Christians” Therefore, an infant
may be baptized to signify her regeneration, provided the family and community sincerely
vow and endeavor to raise that infant according to Christian ideals, as they promise to do at
the baptismal ceremony.33
While Hubmaier’s argument is true that infants cannot make a confession of their sin or
belief in forgiveness in the same way adults can, it should be understood that the sacrament
of baptism is not solely dependent on the recipient's understanding or confession. For
instance the baptism of the entire household, including children in Acts 16:33. Hubmaier also
seems not to have understood baptism as an act of God's grace, initiation into the Christian
community, and incorporation into the body of Christ rather other than just as an individual's
expression of faith.
Furthermore, this argument doesn't consider other ways people understand baptism in Christianity. Some Christians recognize the validity of infant baptism based on theological traditions and scriptural interpretations different from Hubmaier's idea. Therefore, dismissing infant baptism as "not real baptism," makes this argument too simple and ignores the many different beliefs and practices in Christianity
Peter Nyende, in his article “Prepared to Believe: The Evangelism of Pre-schoolers and
Infant Baptism in African Anglican Churches”, observes and gives a summary of the
significance of infant baptism. He says Infant baptism carries significant implications for the
subsequent evangelism and Christian formation of the baptized child. The practice
symbolizes forgiveness of sins, rebirth, and membership in God's family, marking the
beginning of the child's Christian journey.34 I totally agree by Nyende’s summay of the

significance of infant baptism because the practice is deeply rooted in Christian tradition and
theology, symbolizing the forgiveness of sins, rebirth, and the initiation of the child into the
Christian community. This act signifies the child's inclusion in God's family and marks the
beginning of their spiritual journey. And through baptism, the child is welcomed into the
Church and becomes a part of the broader Christian community, receiving the grace and
blessings of God from infancy.
Let’s also consider arguments from silence in response to the criticism of this practice. But
first, let's begin by asking: why not baptize infants? To those who oppose it, we pose a question: "Do you aim to adhere strictly to biblical principles? Then where does Scripture expressly prohibit infant baptism? Can you point to a specific verse?" The truth is, no such
verse exists—there's no scriptural prohibition against infant baptism, nor any verse that contradicts its practice.
This inquiry can be extended: Where in the Bible can we locate a verse wherein the children
of believers are not granted the sign of the covenant? In what instances do children of believers need to reach adulthood, or at least their teenage years, before being baptized? Where are
they instructed to wait for this? And where do we find biblical guidance on preparing the
children of believers for baptism in their later years?
While it's an argument from silence, it's still an argument. It's worth acknowledging the absence of a clear scriptural command regarding infant baptism. The instances of it in the New
Testament, particularly the two household baptisms in Philippi (Acts 16), have sparked debates. Interestingly, Paul instructs the Philippian church to maintain the practices he taught
them (Phil 4:9). David Peterson, former Principal of Oak Hill Theological College in London,
suggests that it's highly unlikely that there were no babies included in any of the four household baptisms described by Luke.
In the New Testament, there are various instances where specific commands are not clearly
given for certain actions. For instance, while polygamy is considered wrong, neither Paul nor
Peter directly addressed it. They assumed that Christians understood its wrongness based on
the teachings of the Old Testament, just as they assumed Christians recognized the wrongness
of a Christian man marrying his sister or aunt. Similarly, the New Testament doesn't expressly mandate that women partake in the Lord’s Supper, yet we don't withhold the bread and
wine from them. Likewise, the absence of a direct command regarding the baptism of infants


does not necessarily prevent its acceptance and approval by God if it can be justified on other
grounds.
Both sides of the debate lack straightforward proof texts. Arguments from silence exist on
both sides, yet the argument isn't based on a specific verse's explicit command. It clear that
the debate isn't just about interpreting a few specific verses; it's about understanding the overall structure and message of the Bible. So, it's important to approach the debate with kindness
towards those who disagree and the humility to patiently discuss and consider different viewpoints.35

Section VII. Conclusion
The topic of infant baptism is actually without any doubt an objectionable one. Believers
from various Christian denominations are unable to view it similarly. Much as they read the
same Bible, and profess their faith to be guided by the same Spirit, they arrive at different
conclusions about this type of baptism. make different conclusion in regard to this form of
baptism.
A greater number of Christians believe that the practice of infant baptism is Scripturally supported while only a small one comprising of mainly those from Pentecostal Churches look at
infant baptism as a practice with no scriptural basis and wrong to perform it.
Such views should not bring confusion and division among the Christians of the province of
the Church of Uganda but rather they should hold on to the doctrine of the Church in regard
to the practice.
The worldwide Anglican Church, where the province of the Church of Uganda falls under
much as it is autonomous plainly declares in the 27th Article of religion that ‘the baptism of
young children is in any wise to be retained, as most agreeable with the institution of Christ.’
This is supported by the numerous Biblical Scholars and other writers whose theological
views are in support of the practice.
And while it may be difficult for infants to understand that baptism brings about a spiritual
rebirth to people, making them become God's children who have entered into a life that is
divine thus making the baptized become members of Christ’s body (The Church)., they are
basic to the Christian faith. The province of the Church of Uganda and the Anglican Church
globally and other various Christian denominations, including the Catholic Church, Orthodox

35 Lee Gatiss. The Anglican Doctrine of Infant Baptism. pp.4-5


Church, Lutheran Church, Presbyterian Church, Methodist Church, Some Nazarene
Churches, Moravian Church, and other Reformed denominations, believe there's no need to
delay such important rites until adulthood.
The practice indeed should not be denied to infants or delayed to be administered until
adulthood because of the significant role it plays in the lives of infants.
Some of the ways through which the practice is significant and are the very reasons as to
why it should be uphold in the province of the Church of Uganda are as follows:
First, it is an acknowledgement of Church membership. Through this ritual, the infant is
acknowledged as a member of the church, which constitutes the assembly of the Lord and
God's family. The believers' children are church members by birth and the sacrament of
baptism acknowledges that membership in a public manner. Similarly, the kids that are born
into the barn belong to the goat’s herder of the flock and are identified with the goat herder's
mark. If the she-goat belongs to the goat herder, the kids belong to him too and he marks
them as his own. The kids that are born into the barn of the Good goat’s herder belong to Him
and are identified with His mark in baptism. If the goats are His, the Kids are His also and He
marks them as His own in the sacrament of baptism.
Children born to believers, who are acknowledged through baptism as church members, are
registered as "non-communing members." They do not have access to all the benefits of full
membership, as they are not allowed to participate in the sacrament of the Lord's Supper or to
vote in congregational meetings. However, upon coming of age and after they have made
their own decision to confirm their faith in the Lord Jesus Christ through a credible
profession, they are registered as full Church members, with all the rights and privileges
associated with it, including participation in Communion. Since they were baptized as
infants, there is no need for them to be re-baptized.

Secondly, baptism of infants is a token of the Covenant. When parents bring their children for
baptism, they claim the benefits of their children to the Covenant of Grace and the blessings
promised to be given by the Lord. This extends not only to believers but also to their
children, as children of believing parents have always been included in God's covenantal
blessings (Genesis 9:9; 17:7; Exodus 20:5; Deuteronomy 29:10-13). For instance, in Joel
2:28, the prophet proclaims, “And afterward, I will pour out my Spirit on all people. Your
sons and daughters will prophesy, your old men will dream dreams, your young men will see
visions. Children born to believing parents are included in the Covenant, and their parents
have the right to claim its benefits for them through the sacrament of baptism. Therefore,


when parents present their children for baptism, they claim for those children the rich legacy
willed by God to them in Jesus Christ. The richest benefits which parents claim for their
children in this sacrament are the Holy Spirit and everlasting Life. Thus, from the moment of
baptism, children begin receiving the Covenant's benefits and the blessings given by God
through Christ. 36

Lastly, infant baptism signifies the washing away of original sin and regeneration. In the case
of new-born infants, the old life which they come with is to be left behind, the defilement of
which is to be washed away, and from which regeneration is to be sought. The remedy was
found in the doctrine of original sin. All people born into the world are born in a fallen state,
interpreted in various ways: as a corruption of human nature or as the loss of the supernatural
life originally given to Adam. Baptism, then, acts as a remedy for this fallen state caused by
original sin. It purifies the infant's soul, thereby restoring the supernatural gifts of heavenly
life through the atonement of Christ, which Adam had not enjoyed before the fall.37

Given the above arguments, the practice of infant baptism continues to be significant in the
province of the Church of Uganda and should therefore be uphold since it still remains a
tradition that is deeply rooted within the Church and many other Christian denominations
mentioned earlier. And as a tradition that serves as a visible sign of God's grace and the
initiation of children into the covenant community of faith, the adherents of the Church and
those from other Christian denominations that practice it should continue embracing it; taking
into consideration that the practice has a Biblical basis and it also remains a valid sacramental
rite whenever it is administered in the Triune Name. And so, regardless of the position of
those who object its practice, it is clearly evident that infant baptism holds profound
theological significance and continues to shape the beliefs and practices of many Christians
not only in Uganda but also in other parts of the world.
