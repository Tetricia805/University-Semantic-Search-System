ABSTRACT
This research focuses on supplementing the wastewater treatment processes at Kakoba
Waste Stabilization ponds using phytoremediation (using aquatic plants). There has
been a positive response in harnessing the technology of plants to clean wastewater.
Improperly treated domestic wastewater is quite harmful to the environment. Scientists
are intricately studying this approach and the realization is its cost effectiveness,
ecofriendly attributes and ability for it to run with no need for energy. The major aim
of this specific study is to investigate how effectively Water Lettuce remove nutrients,
and BOD from secondary treated wastewater. It put a test the polishing abilities of
domestic wastewater. Treatment was executed in two troughs, one tub without the
water lettuce was taken as the control unit and the second labeled the treatment unit
that had the water lettuce. The troughs were of dimensions 0.7m× 0.5m× 0.3m. The
sewage samples were assessed for three pollutants, T.N, T.P and BOD. After 10 days,
the results were impressive from the treatment, they showed that water lettuce
removed 80.93% and 77.90% removal efficiency of T.P and T.N respectively. After 15
days. Because the effluent from the treatment unit met the discharge standards for
T.N, T.P and BOD5 it was safe to be released into the environment.
This study focused on optimizing the existing infrastructure in a to meet the present
demands in a cost effective and environmentally sustainable manner.

CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION
1.1 BACKGROUND
The ideal wastewater treatment is one that delivers top-notch quality effluent while
keeping costs low and operational demands minimal (Mahassen M., 2018). Wastewater
treatment is important for the reduction of contaminants and pollutants of natural
water sources. The quality of water in these bodies is significantly affected by the
discharge of poorly treated wastewater effluent into these bodies from the different
institutional wastewater treatment plants.
The high energy demands of WWTP have emerged as a significant financial burden,
impacting their overall economic viability (Li, 2017). This highlights the need for
exploring more energy efficient treatment processes to minimize operational costs.
Large scale, conventional sewage treatment plants can have significant carbon
footprint. An average carbon footprint of 0.78kg CO2 equivalent per cubic meter was
discovered by a study conducted in India (Singh et al., 2016). As a response to this
predicament, many countries are embracing low cost environmentally friendly
technologies. An example is using aquatic plants in the phytoremediation process for
treatment of wastewater.
Wastewater Stabilization Ponds Technology is another one of the most convenient and
vastly growing treatment methods for developing countries (where using the
conventional method is costly) (Belay D, 2022). Because of the nature of processes this
mode of treatment entails, it’s even more favorable for countries in the tropical region
(regions characterized by consistently mild to warm weather throughout the year). This


mode of treatment is natural, self-sufficient, possesses a straight-forward design,
minimal operator responsibility to operate the system hence labour expenses are
minimized.
Phytoremediation is the technology that harnesses plants in remediating soils, water,
sediments and sludge. These plants are outfitted with mechanisms for adsorption and
translocation of nutrients from the environment. The plants are harvested and can be
deposited in various ways for example, vermicomposting done with the help of worms
producing a nutrient rich compost suitable for gardening (Lumbricus rubellus and red
wigglers) (The Worm Composting Company, 2023)
Meeting treatment and effluent discharge standards has proven to be a significant
challenge, particularly in developing countries where there is deficiency of technology
and qualified personnel (Letshwenyo W., 2018). In developing world, waste stabilization
pond (WSP) has been widely used especially where land is abundant, and climate is
favorable especially temperature and sunlight. Uganda is one of the countries in the
tropical Region that uses Wastewater Stabilization as a treatment method for domestic
waste water. However, many of these systems have been performing below the
required standards (Letshwenyo W., 2018). The causes are inadequate operation and
maintenance practices, and the buildup of sludge in the ponds among many other
factors (Letshwenyo W., 2018). Effluent water samples were analysed for; Phosphate
mean concentration levels (NEMA-5mg/l) Phosphate mean concentration levels; NO3
was 10 mg/l; NH4 concentration was 385.33 mg/l (NEMA -10MG/l); Colour 1627.67 TCUs
(NEMA – 50 TCU); Turbidity – 186.63NTUs (NEMA).


1.2 PROBLEM STATEMENT
Mbarara Municipality's Kakoba waste stabilization ponds have been performing below
the required standards due to chronic buildup of sludge in the ponds (Letshwenyo W.,
2018). Limited maintenance budgets restrict proper desludging, allowing sludge to
accumulate over time. This coincides with a growing population in Mbarara, placing a
continuously increasing burden on the wastewater treatment system's capacity.
Despite desludging efforts in June 2023, the sludge problem persists, indicating a
potential need for alternative or more frequent management strategies.
The consequences of this situation are severe. They include environmental
consequences; water pollution from the high organic content in the wastewater
effluent, algal blooms due to increased nutrient levels in water bodies (River Rwizi
where the effluent is deposited), the foul smell radiating from the waste stabilization
ponds, public health concerns include disease outbreaks for example, typhoid
dysentery; health risks from pollutants for example, digestive issues. Ineffectively
treated wastewater poses a significant threat of environmental contamination.
Untreated or inadequately treated wastewater can harbor harmful pathogens,
jeopardizing public health in the surrounding communities. This situation necessitates
a prompt and effective solution to safeguard public health, environmental quality, and
the long-term sustainability of the wastewater treatment system.


1.3 OBJECTIVES FOR STUDY
1.3.1 MAIN OBJECTIVE
❖ To investigate the use of water lettuce in removal of nutrients from wastewater
at Kakoba Treatment Plant.
1.3.2 SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES
1. To determine baseline conditions of removal rates of BOD, TN and TP in the
existing maturation pond.
2. To determine the effectiveness of water Lettuce in removing BOD, TN And Total
Phosphorous.
3. To evaluate how much water lettuce is most effective in optimizing removal of
BOD, TN and TP.
1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS
1. What are the baseline conditions of removal rates of BOD, TN and Total
Phosphorous?
2. What is the effectiveness of water Lettuce in removing BOD, TN And Total
Phosphorous?
3. How much water lettuce is most effective in optimizing removal of BOD, TN
and TP?



1.5 JUSTIFICATION
Nutrient removal from the wastewater generated is important to protect the receiving
water bodies from eutrophication. Despite desludging of the ponds, the effluent from
the ponds does not meet the discharge standards which is detrimental to the
environment.
Since Water Lettuce is famous for its phytoremediation ability, it has the ability to
break down pollutants like BOD and reduction of nutrients in wastewater through its
different parts (roots and leaves). The cumulative effort of the invasive plant
contributes enhancing the treatment process in the maturation pond. It provides an
additional attribute of breaking down BOD.
Water lettuce also has the likelihood for accumulating the nutrients it takes up (Khater
and Ali, 2022). This stored biomass is then harvested and prospectively employed as a
fertilizer hence fulfilling the objective of sustainability through resource recovery.
Aquatic plants are simple in operation, low maintenance and low cost in operation and
are self-sustaining. They are suited for the atmosphere given they thrive most in
tropical climates which describes the climate of Kakoba.
They provide a technology favorable for the limited budgets given that solely depend
on natural processes for nutrient uptake and BOD reduction (removal of pollutants).
This is in sync with the goal of probing low-energy and conceivably low-cost alternatives
for supplementing unconventional wastewater treatment processes. The systems of
aquatic plants can also operate at higher loading rates.




CHAPTER TWO: LITERATURE REVIEW
2.1 INTRODUCTION
2.2 WASTEWATER
This refers to used water that contains a mixture of both organic and inorganic material
that is harmful to the environment (Shah, 2017). It simply means water that is not clean
because it has been used in households, factories, runoff from farms, and others.
Wastewater is polluted water, and its pollutants are from both point sources and
dispersed sources(R L and Mehta, 2020). It is dangerous to the environment when
released without treatment.
Point sources: this simply means a single identifiable source of pollution for example
drain or a pipe (usually industrial wastewater effluent being discharged by a pipe into
a river)
Dispersed/ non-point sources: Also known as diffuse pollution simply mean inputs that
happen over a large/ wide area and can be zeroed down to one source. They are usually
attributed to a specific land use for example urban land use, Agricultural land use and
factory land use and others. Diffuse pollution is executed by agents like storm water
that greatly impact the water quality of the different waterways they flow into (EPA,
2021).
Wastewater from the different sources affects the quality of surface and ground water
this is as a result detrimental to human health and the health of the environment at
large(Madhav et al., 2019). Therefore, wastewater management and treatment are a
concern for the globe, and is also a key factor of the water cycle.


2.2.1 BLACK WATER
Black water refers to wastewater from toilets that contains human waste, urine, and
toilet paper(Geary, 1998). It's considered highly contaminated with pathogens and
bacteria that can cause illness. Black water can also contain harmful gases like methane
and hydrogen sulfide, which can be dangerous in high quantities.
The various technologies for the consumption and or reuse of waste water effluent
include macrophyte pond, aquaculture, irrigation, discharge for recharge to a water
body or ground water (Elizabeth T., 2014). The technologies involved in generating
black water include, pour flush toilets, Dry Cleansing materials, cistern flush toilets.
The blackwater generated by the users connects to the semi-centralized treatment
amenity by a (gravity) simpler sewer network.
National Water and Sewerage Corporation the body incharge of treatment of
wastewater in Uganda employs two major ways of treatment of wastewater. These
include,
• Conventional treatment methods: involve a combination of both physical,
chemical and biological processes to degrade and remove solid particles and
other harmful substances from sewage.
• Non-conventional methods employ biological processes to remove harmful
substances from the sewage. These mainly take place in stabilization ponds.
2.3 WASTEWATER PARAMETERS
These refer to the measurable characteristics of wastewater that help determine the
quality of wastewater before it is discharged to the environment. They are classified


into physical, chemical, and biological quality parameters. They sometimes depend on
the source of generation.
The Physical parameters include color, odor and temperature, suspended solids with
regards to the current makeup of the environment we focus on the main parameters of
wastewater. These are BOD, Total Nitrogen, Total Phosphorous, Heavy metals, Total
Suspended Solids, Chemical Oxygen Demand (Alumichem, 2023). These parameters
must be reduced and controlled before the wastewater eluent is released into the
environment. They are explained as below.
2.3.1 Colour
Colour in wastewater is mainly from municipal contamination and industrial impurities
of iron and manganese and other corrosive products. Organic matter present in water
is usually associated with humus, minerals and other materials which are natural
impurities and corrosive products.
The variability of color within the sample for the sewage effluents in Kakoba was still
very low (CV; 14.67%). The mean color of the sewage effluents was (1627.67 ̊C).
However, the color (TCUs) of the sewage effluents were higher than the EPA (20 - 150),
NWSC, 500 [16] and NEMA (300) standards. (Atwebembeire, 2019). Colour does not vary
during the wet or dry season because the runoffs from the rain does not affect the
effluent because the water is piped directly to the treatment plant.
2.3.2 Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)
BOD refers to the amount of dissolved oxygen needed by aerobic biological organisms
to break down the organic material present in the water over a period of 5 days at a


temperature of 20°C (Alumichem, 2023). This specific parameter indicates the shortterm impact on the oxygen levels of the receiving water body. It measures the amount
of organic contamination in the water (the organics that can be biologically oxidized).
High BOD levels lead to decrease of oxygen in receiving water bodies hence death of
aquatic life. physical, chemical, and biological methods are employed to cater for
removal of this parameter.
2.3.3 Nitrates
Nitrates is a form of nitrogen and vital nutrient for growth, reproduction, and survival
for organisms. Nitrate is a very important parameter because it estimates the organic
pollution in a particular area, and it represents the highest oxidized form of nitrogen.
Nitrate is one of the very common contaminants in the ground and surface waters.
Nitrates occur naturally in source water because of decaying plants. Agricultural
sources of nitrates include livestock waste matter and chemical fertilizers. Nitrate
concentrations exhibited extremely very high variability within samples of Kakoba
(122.47%) sewage effluents and mean values of (10 mg/l) effluents. The mean NO3 levels
were higher than the NWSC maximum permissible limit (5 mg/l) but below the EPA
standard (50 mg/l) (Atwebembeire, 2019).
2.3.4 Total Phosphorous (Total-P)
Total phosphorous refers to the measure of all the phosphorous in the wastewater both
in particulate form and soluble form. Phosphorous translates into increased growth of
algae in the stream. Causing competition with aquatic life hence chocking oxygen in
the water source leading to Eutrophication changing the whole ecosystem.


2.3.5 pH
pH is the concentration of hydrogen ions and is calculated by the negative logarithm of
the hydrogen ion (H+). pH represents an important characteristic of water and small
changes in its level can disorganize the quality of water making it unsuitable for use as
it influences the availability of micronutrients as well as trace metals.
High pH values also increase the toxic nature of other pollutants in the river, basing on
an example of ammonia which is much more toxic in alkaline water than acid due to
free ammonia NH3. pH is also an important parameter in evaluating the acid-base
balance of water.
Thus, pH of valve of 7 is neutral, a pH less than 7 is acidic, and a pH greater than 7
represents base saturation or alkaline. Kakoba sewage effluents exhibited very low
values within sample variability of pH (CV; 3.3% - 5.3%) (Atwebembeire, 2019).
2.3.6 Temperature
Temperature measured in ̊C is a key factor in biological activity and microorganisms
can be psychrophilic, mesophilic, and thermophilic. Aquatic organisms thrive only
within specific temperature ranges. Temperature exhibited very low variability within
samples of sewage effluents (CV; 18.36%) with statistically insignificant variation of
mean temperature in sewage (25.05 ̊C) (Atwebembeire, 2019).
2.3.7 Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)
• Concept: BOD is a broader term that refers to the amount of dissolved oxygen
required by microorganisms to decompose organic matter in water over a specific
period of time.


• Timeframe: The timeframe for BOD can be variable, but it's not typically
specified unless mentioned alongside the test method.
• Measurement: BOD is a theoretical value and cannot be directly measured.
Instead, it's estimated by measuring the remaining dissolved oxygen after a
period of incubation with a sample of the water being tested.
BOD5 (5-day BOD)
Concept: BOD5 is the most common way to measure BOD. It specifically refers to the
amount of dissolved oxygen consumed by microorganisms during a 5-day incubation
period at a standardized temperature (usually 20°C). It gives a snapshot of the overall
consumption rate within a specific timeframe.
• Standardized Test: BOD5 is a standardized test with a defined methodology,
ensuring consistency and allowing for comparison of results across different
studies and locations.
• Practicality: BOD5 is a practical and widely used method because it provides a
good estimate of the biodegradable organic matter present in water, which can
impact oxygen levels and aquatic life. It offers a balance between accuracy and
testing time.
2.4 WASTEWATER TREATMENT
These refer to infrastructure which safeguards health of the public by removing
impurities from wastewater before it is re-introduced into various parts of the
environment such as, aquifers, rivers, lakes and swamps (Jerry A, 2023).


The modern world relies heavily on a hidden network: wastewater systems. These
critical infrastructures safeguard public health and the environment by collecting,
treating, and disposing of wastewater. Untreated wastewater, also known as sewage,
can contaminate water sources, spread diseases, and harm aquatic ecosystems
(CHEMTECH INTERNATIONAL, 2021).
Components present in Domestic waste water and their risks.
• Microorganisms (viruses, pathogenic bacteria and worm eggs) which cause
diseases like cholera typhoid and others.
• Biodegradable organic materials which cause oxygen depletion in water bodes
leading to death of aquatic life.
• Other organic mateials forexample, detergents, pesticides , fat, oil and grease,
colouring, solvents cyanide and phenol which cause toxic effects, aesthetic
depletion and bioaccumulation in the food chain.
• Nutrients forexample, Nitrogen and Phosphorous, ammonium. These cause
eutrophication leading to toxic effects from oxygen depletion.
• Metals including Hg, Pb, Cd, Ni, and Cu leading to toxic effects to human beings.
Such effects include cancers and tumors, damage to the nervous sytem and
others.
• Odour (and taste) from Hydrogen sulphide which leads to aesthetic
inconviniences, stomach upset and toxic effects from air pollution.


2.4.1 WASTE STABILIATION PONDS
Waste stabilization ponds are colossal, shallow outdoor basins in which sunlight bacteria
and algae synergize to purify raw sewage through natural processes (Kayombo S., 2018),
This method of wastewater treatment is a biologically driven treatment approach that
represents a natural and cost-effective technique of treatment (Green M., 2008).
It comprises of man-made ponds or basins that leverage naturally occurring biological
processes mediated by microbial communities to breakdown and remove organic matter
and pathogens from wastewater (Ghinea, 2020). In some instances, they could be
designed to work as single units or configured in a series for enhanced treatment
efficiency of the wastewater (Souza, 2019).
WSP offers a remarkable approach for treating wastewater in an environmentally
friendly way. The treated wastewater, called effluent, can be reused for various
purposes like irrigation, fish farming (aquaculture), and overall water conservation.
This benefits the environment and public health. However, reusing the effluent isn't
always possible. It can only be reused if it meets specific quality standards.
In cases where effluent is to be used for irrigation fish pond fertilization, only the
Anaerobic and Facultative ponds are needed (Coldebella et al., 2017). These are also
only employed if weak sewage is to be purified before discharge to recharge the surface
water sources (Kayombo S., 2018). Many countries have strict regulations due to the
potential presence of harmful organisms (pathogens) in the treated water.
This is especially true for unrestricted irrigation of raw vegetables like cabbage and
spinach. Therefore, whoever operates the system must closely monitor the biological


and chemical components within the treatment process. This ensures the treated water
meets the required standards and regulations.
Three distinct pond types are connected. They are categorized as, anaerobic,
facultative, and maturation/ polishing pond. They are employed in the WSP system
each with unique design characteristics that optimize the biological Treatment process
occurring within.
2.4.1.1 Anaerobic Pond
These ponds are suited to receive and treat waste water that is highly organically
loaded that is, the Volumetric loading >100G BOD/m3. day that is equivalent to
>3000kg/ha. day for a 3m depth) (Kayombo S., 2018).
Volumetric loading is a very fundamental aspect of designing these ponds and is given
by Equation 2.1,
λv= LiQ
Va
⁄

Equation 2.1
Where;
Li- Influent BOD (mg/l)
Va- Pond of the anaerobic pond
Q- Flow rate (m3/day)
For optimal treatment it is advised that the loading should range between; 100 – 400
g/ m3. day. This helps sustain the anaerobic environment (Meiring et al., 1998)
(Kayombo S., 2018).
These ponds luck dissolved oxygen and algae, this creates an environment suitable for
anaerobic bacteria (Kayombo S., 2018). These bacteria break down organic matter into


simpler compounds while releasing methane and Carbon dioxide (Kadlec, 2009). This
done by sedimentation of solids and as a result anaerobic digestion (most pronounced
at 15°C). This then is the birth of sludge in the anaerobic pond (Kayombo S., 2018).
It is important to neutralize acidic wastewater since the anaerobic bacteria is affected
by a pH <6.2. An efficiently designed anaerobic pond can remove 40% of Organic Matter
at 10°C but this efficiently jumps to 60% at 20°C (McCarty, 2011; Lettinga, 1995).
This pond typically functions as a deep (2-5 meters) entirely anaerobic environment
that reduces solids and BOD. The residence time of the waste water within this pond is
quite short, ranging from 1 to 7 days. HRT is calculated on the formular given in
Equation 2.2 below;
ta= Va
Q
Equation 2.2
The specific design parameters which include depth and detention time are determined
based on the characteristics of the influent wastewater, specifically the organic
loading.
Anaerobic bacteria thrive in this pond and this process effectively removes up to 60%
of the BOD from wastewater. Due to their ability to handle high organic loads, anaerobic
ponds are well suited for treating strong wastewaters (Elizabeth T., 2014). A summary
of the percentage reductions at different temperatures compared to the initial Influent
loadings is given in Table 2-1.

2.4.1.2 Facultative Pond
These ponds are shallower than anaerobic ponds, 1m- 2m deep with the aim of
optimizing these processes (enabling sufficient oxygen mixing to the upper layer). There
are two types of Facultative ponds. These include;
• Primary facultative
These are ponds which take in raw wastewater. These types of units are very commonly
used and studied. First models are the basis for their designs (F. J. A. da Silva, 2010).

Equation 2.3
L= L0e−k.HRT
Equation 2.4
Where L0 and L are the influent and effluent BOD (mg/l)
HRT- Mean hydraulic retention time (days)
k- is the first order removal rate (day−). This depends on temperature (F. J. A. da Silva,
2010).
• Secondary facultative
These are ponds whose sources include, anaerobic ponds, septic tanks, primary
facultative ponds.


They exhibit both aerobic and anaerobic zones mainly because of the presence of
surface layer that has DO. The bacteria in this pond find this zone ideal because they
can take advantage of both aerobic and fermentation pathways to further decompose
the organic material (Vymazal, 2015).
The Synergistic relationship between aerobic and anaerobic communities within the
facultative pond facilitates significant reductions in BOD- up to 75%. Detention times
within the FP are strategically controlled falling between 5 – 30 days ensuring time for
wastewater treatment by both aerobic and anaerobic conditions.
2.4.1.3 Maturation Pond
They are commonly known as Finishing or Polishing Ponds (Elizabeth T., 2014). It is the
final step in the treatment process of WSP systems. these ponds are designed to be
ultimately aerobic. They promote the growth of aerobic bacteria that further degrade
organic matter and eliminate pathogens through different mechanisms (Arias, 2014).
These ponds are the shallowest component within the WSP constructed with depths
ranging from 0.5 – 1.5 meters (Vymazal, 2009). This strategic design ensures that
sunlight penetrates the full depth of the pond, maximizing the photic zone for algal
photosynthesis (Arias, 2014). As algae undergo photosynthesis during daylight hours,
they produce DO a crucial resource for aerobic bacteria residing within the pond.
However, DO levels naturally fluctuate throughout the day, reaching peak
concentrations during sunlight-driven photosynthesis and declining at night due to the
absence of this process (Vymazal, 2015).


On top of this, they also remove nitrogen and phosphorous and this can be amplified by
strategic practices (Elizabeth T., 2014). When combined with algae and fish harvesting
techniques, these ponds demonstrate remarkable capacity to remove significant
portion of remaining nitrogen and phosphorous hence minimized discharge of these
pollutants into the environment (Vymazal, 2015).MP are majorly designed for Removal
of Pathogens.
These ponds have a liner which bar leaching. The line could be compacted earth
asphalt, clay, or any other material. A protective bar is constructed around the pond’s
perimeter to using the excavated material during pond construction (Vymazal, 2009).
This term physically bars, effectively intercepts and diverts runoff away from the pond,
hence minimizing potential for erosion along the shoreline (Arias, 2014). The use of the
excavated material for berm construction offers cost-effective and sustainable
approach to pond protection (Kadlec, 2009).
2.4.2 IMPORTANT TERMS
2.4.2.1 Drogue
A drogue is a device or instrument used in wastewater treatment systems to measure
the velocity, flow direction, and turbulence of water within ponds or tanks. It typically
consists of a weighted object or float attached to a line, which is submerged into the
water and allowed to move freely. By tracking the movement of the drogue over a
period, operators can assess the flow patterns and hydraulic characteristics of the
wastewater within the treatment system.


2.4.2.2 Pond Geometry
Pond geometry refers to the physical shape and dimensions of a wastewater treatment
pond. This includes parameters such as length, width, depth, and surface area. The
geometry of a pond plays a crucial role in determining its hydraulic efficiency, retention
time, and treatment performance. Different geometrical configurations, such as
rectangular, circular, or irregular shapes, can impact factors such as flow patterns,
sedimentation efficiency, and mixing characteristics within the pond.
2.4.2.3 Sludge Accumulation Assessment
Sludge accumulation assessment involves the measurement and evaluation of the
buildup of organic and inorganic solids (sludge) within wastewater treatment ponds
over time (Mahassen M., 2018). This process typically includes regular monitoring of
sludge depth, volume, and characteristics to assess the efficiency of sedimentation,
solids removal, and overall treatment performance.
Techniques for sludge accumulation assessment may include manual sampling and
analysis, sedimentation tests, sludge blanket measurement, and use of sedimentation
cones or settling velocity meters. Evaluating sludge accumulation is essential for
determining the need for desludging or maintenance activities to prevent operational
issues and maintain treatment efficiency in the pond.
2.4.3 Factors affecting the Efficiency of Waste Stabilization Ponds
Several factors significantly influence the efficiency of wastewater treatment in
stabilization ponds (WSPs). Below is a breakdown of some key factors:


2.4.3.1 Wastewater Characteristics
• Strength: The concentration of organic matter (measured by Biological Oxygen
Demand (BOD) or Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)) in the influent wastewater
can significantly affect treatment efficiency(Singh, Singh and Singh, 2021).
Higher organic loads require larger ponds or longer retention times for proper
treatment by the microorganisms within the ponds (Mara M., 2004).
• Nutrients: The presence of nitrogen and phosphorus can impact treatment.
While some bacteria in the ponds utilize these for growth, excessive
concentrations cause algal blooms, potentially hindering treatment by reducing
sunlight penetration and oxygen levels needed for aerobic digestion of organic
matter to take place (Chen J., 2013).
• Toxic substances: Industrial wastewater may contain toxic chemicals that can
inhibit the growth and multiplication of beneficial microorganisms in the ponds,
reducing treatment efficiency (Eddy, 2014). These chemicals include, dyes, acids
and others. Some of these could drastically affect the physiochemical properties
of the water making it dangerous for the microbes.
2.4.3.2 Operational Factors
• Hydraulic Retention Time (HRT): The amount of time wastewater spends in the
pond system is crucial (Anggarini et al., 2015). A longer HRT allows for more
complete treatment by providing more time for natural processes to occur.
Factors like pond depth and flow rate influence HRT.


• Organic Loading Rate: This simply means the amount of organic matter entering
the pond system per unit of surface area (Orhorhoro and Sadjere, 2018).
Overloading the ponds with organic matter can overwhelm the natural treatment
processes, leading to inefficient removal of pollutants (Mahapatra, Samal and
Dash, 2022).
• Pond Design: Factors like depth of the ponds, configuration (series of ponds can
be more efficient), and the presence of baffles (flow directors) can all influence
treatment efficiency. For instance, proper depth allows for stratification, where
settlement and biological processes occur at different zones within the pond.
For the deeper layers, Anaerobic digestion of organic matter and aerobic
digestion for the shallower zones that have oxygen from diffusion in the water
column (US Environmental Protection Agency, 1983).
HRT= V
Q
Equation 2.5

Where;
HRT – Hydraulic Retention Time (Days)
V – Volume of the wastewater treatment pond (cubic meters)
Q – Influent inflow entering the pond (cubic meters per day)
2.4.3.3 Environmental Factors
• Temperature:


Warmer temperatures generally promote faster biological activity by microorganisms,
leading to improved treatment efficiency (Sharaf A., 2014).
• Sunlight: Sunlight is essential for algal growth, which plays a role in oxygen
production through photosynthesis and nutrient uptake within the ponds (Chen
J., 2013).
• Wind: Wind can help mix the pond contents and promote oxygen transfer, but
excessive wind can also disrupt the settled sludge layer, potentially impacting
treatment (Orr S. J., 2019).
• pH: The optimal pH range for the microorganisms in WSPs is slightly alkaline (pH
7-8). Deviations from this range can affect treatment efficiency by impacting
microbial growth and multiplication (Hanif M. A., 2016). Hence digestion of
organic matter present in the wastewater is affected.
2.4.3.4 Monitoring and Maintenance
• Regular monitoring of factors like influent and effluent quality, pond depth, and
sludge accumulation is essential to maintain optimal performance. Early
detection of issues allows for timely adjustments to operational parameters
(Hanif M. A., 2016).
• Periodic desludging to remove excess settled solids is crucial to prevent pond
capacity reduction and potential short-circuiting of flow within the system,
where wastewater bypasses treatment stages (Orr S. J., 2019).


By understanding and managing these factors, operator's optimization of the efficiency
of wastewater treatment in stabilization ponds, ensuring proper effluent quality and
environmental protection is possible.

2.5 FLOATING MICROPHYTES
Floating macrophytes, also known as free-floating macrophytes or aquatic
macrophytes, are a fascinating group of macroscopic plants which are invasive to the
water surface of freshwater ecosystems like ponds, lakes, and slow-moving rivers
(Khurshid, Ali and Hameed, 2020). Unlike their submerged relatives, these plants are
not rooted in the sediment but possess unique adaptations that allow them to thrive on
the water's surface (Bornette and Puijalon, 2009).


2.5.1 Buoyancy Adaptations for Light Capture
To maintain their floating position at the water-air interface, these unique plants have
evolved various ingenious mechanisms. Some species, like water hyacinth (Eichhornia
crassipes), boast air-filled bladders on their petioles (leaf stalks) that provide
exceptional buoyancy (Sánchez, 2001).
Water Lettuce has tiny hairs underneath its leaves that hold bubbles of air forming a
basket-like structure that keeps the plants floating on the water surface. Others, such
as certain duckweed species (Lemna spp.), have developed lightweight and spongy
tissues that keep them afloat (Xu, 2016).
These adaptations are crucial for maximizing sunlight access, a critical factor for
photosynthesis since light intensity diminishes rapidly as it penetrates the water column
(Duarte, 2016).
2.5.2 Nutrient Acquisition Strategies
Since they lack a connection to bottom sediments, floating macrophytes have
developed alternative strategies for nutrient uptake. Many species possess specialized
structures on their leaves or stems, like trichomes, that efficiently absorb dissolved
nutrients directly from the water column (Lesiv, Polishchuk and Antonyak, 2020). This
allows them capitalize on the nutrient-rich surface water layer, ensuring their growth
and survival (Duarte, 2016).
2.5.3 Ecological Importance and Services Provided
Floating macrophytes are vital components of healthy freshwater ecosystems, playing
a multifaceted role in maintaining their ecological balance. They provide a crucial food


source and refuge for a diverse range of aquatic organisms, including fish,
invertebrates, and amphibians (Duarte, 2016).
Additionally, these plants act as natural biofilters, filtering out pollutants and excess
nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus through their tissues and associated microbial
communities (Xu, 2016). Their presence at the water surface also helps regulate water
temperature by providing shade, which can be particularly important for maintaining
suitable habitat conditions for temperature-sensitive species (Boyce, 2010). Such
species include;
• Salmonoids; these are fish that belong to the salmonoid family for example trout,
salmon and char. Even minor temperature increase beyond their optimum range
could disrupt their growth rates and spawning cycles.
• Macroinvertebrates; Specifically, mayflies (Ephemeroptera). These are aquatic
insects which are sensitive water indicators of water quality and some of them
have very specific water temperature requirements for their different stages of
life (Lenat, 1986).
• Amphibians; They depend on external sources for body heat regulation and are
vulnerable in extreme temperatures (Blaustein A., 2010). They include frogs and
toads.
Furthermore, the complex structures formed by floating macrophytes create habitat
heterogeneity, promoting a wider range of species and enhancing overall biodiversity
within the ecosystem (Gopal, 2005).


2.5.4 Potential Challenges and Management Considerations
While undoubtedly beneficial, the uncontrolled growth of some floating macrophytes
can pose challenges. Dense mats of these plants can significantly block sunlight
penetration, potentially leading to oxygen depletion in the water body (Les D., 2012).
This significantly disrupt the delicate balance of the ecosystem and harms other aquatic
organisms.
Additionally, excessive growth can obstruct navigation and recreational activities on
the waterbody (Gopal, 2005). Effective management strategies are crucial to maintain
a healthy balance of floating macrophytes in aquatic ecosystems (Les D., 2012).
Techniques include;
• mechanical harvesting.
• Controlled introduction of herbivorous fish
• Manipulation of water levels
2.6 Sustainable Management and Research
As the focus on ecosystem preservation and sustainable freshwater management
intensifies, the ecological roles and functions of floating macrophytes are garnering
increasing attention (Duarte, 2016). Recent research delves deeper into the potential
of these plants to mitigate climate change impacts, particularly their capacity of carbon
sequestration and nutrient recycling within fresh water ecosystems (Hanson P., 2023).
With an increased understanding of these macrophytes, management strategies that
only ensure their continued ecological merits but also address the challenges associated
with their unlimited growth are addressed (Xu X., 2021).


2.7 PHYTOREMEDIATION
Phytoremediation is a process that harnesses the natural ability of plants to directly
absorb nutrients and accumulate pollutants within their biomass during growth (Feng,
2014). It is a general terminology for the various technologies that plants employ to
treat soils, water and sludge contaminated with organic and inorganic contaminants
(Nivetha C., 2016). Unconventional wastewater treatment systems in this integrate
floating microphytes have emerged as a promising approach to wastewater treatment
and resource recovery, promoting sustainability and cost-effectiveness (Arias, 2014).
These systems mimic natural processes, achieving waste stabilization and nutrient
removal through mechanisms similar to conventional methods like activated sludge and
trickling filters (Vymazal, 2009). While physical sedimentation and bacterial activity
are crucial aspects, aquatic plants offer an additional treatment pathway through
phytoremediation (Vymazal, 2015). Following harvest, this biomass can be further
utilized or disposed of responsibly.
2.7.1 Characteristics of aquatic plants;
• Higher tolerance to a large range of temperatures
• High rate of growth in wetlands.
2.7.2 Macrophytes
Are species which grow in water. These plants are extensively distributed with some
exhibiting cosmopolitan distribution (found globally) while others demonstrate regional
patterns of closely related species. They have diverse habitat preferences within
macrophytes. Some species thrive in deep water, while others prefer shallow zones.


Notably, some exhibit emergent growth forms, remaining partially above the water
surface. Floating and amphibious growth strategies are also mentioned, showcasing the
adaptability of these plants to varying water levels and durations.
Morphological and Physiological Diversity: Macrophytes exhibit a high degree of
morphological plasticity, meaning their physical form can vary depending on
environmental conditions. Additionally, their physiological and metabolic processes
demonstrate adaptability in response to environmental changes.
2.7.2.1 Water Lettuce
Water lettuce (Pistia stratiotes), a native of tropical and subtropical regions, graces the
water's surface with its floating, lettuce-like fronds. Its lush mat- like leaves grow and
create a shady haven for aquatic life, enhancing the overall beauty of the water body.
Additionally, water lettuce is valued for its contribution to improved water quality. Its
is attributed for Nutrient removal and reduction of organic matter from wastewater.
2.7.3 General uses of water Lettuce
Nutrient Bioremediation: This plant possesses a remarkable capacity for nutrient
sequestration. Its root structure facilitates the uptake of excess nitrogen (as nitrates)
and phosphorus (as phosphates), both of which can contribute to eutrophication and
undesirable algal blooms. The specific mechanisms underlying this nutrient uptake
likely involve a combination of active transport processes mediated by membrane
proteins and passive diffusion driven by concentration gradients. The precise genes and
enzymes responsible for nutrient transport in water lettuce remain uncharacterized,


but plant families like Araceae (to which water lettuce belongs) might possess specific
transporter proteins facilitating nitrogen and phosphate uptake.
Aesthetic Enhancement: Water lettuce, with its distinctive lettuce-like foliage, adds a
visually appealing element to ponds, lakes, and other water features.
Habitat Formation and Biodiversity Enhancement: The dense root matrix creates a
complex bio-architecture that serves as a refuge and breeding ground for diverse
aquatic fauna. Fish species utilize these underwater havens for spawning and hiding
from predators. Invertebrates like insects and amphibians also benefit from the
structural complexity offered by the roots.
Light Attenuation and Thermal Regulation: By forming a dense surface cover, water
lettuce acts as a natural shade provider. This shading effect reduces light penetration
into the water column, mitigating excessive solar radiation for sensitive aquatic
organisms. Additionally, the shade helps regulate water temperature, potentially
creating cooler microclimates within the water body.
Sediment Stabilization and Erosion Control: The extensive root network of water
lettuce functions as a biological anchor (up-to 24 inches deep), binding and stabilizing
bottom sediments. This root matrix also dampens wave action near shorelines, reducing
erosion and protecting the integrity of the aquatic environment.
2.7.4 Growing water lettuce happens best under three conditions
❖ Suitable Environment:
The water body, pond or container should be positioned in a way that it is constantly
exposed to sufficient sunlight exposure and a warm temperature exceeding 15°C


(60°F). the water should be maintained at nutrient-rich water composition to promote
optimal photosynthesis processes leading to heathy plant growth. Water Lettuce
requires at least six hours of direct sunlight daily.
❖ Gentle Introduction:
The plants thrive most on water surfaces that have little agitation. This is because they
are floating plants whose roots grow up to 24 inches deep. Therefore, intense surface
agitation is a stumbling block for their proper growth and optimal multiplication. It is
important to Carefully place the water lettuce on the water surface. The plants
naturally float, with their roots dangling freely in the water.
2.7.4.1 Water lettuce in pond
To ensure water lettuce thrives and flourishes, several key factors require attention:
they are as follows
• Abundant sunshine is essential for water lettuce. When positioning the pond,
aim for 6-8 hours of direct sunlight per day.
• This tropical plant thrives in warmth. Ideal water temperatures range from
20-30°C (68-86°F). During colder months or climates, the plants might need
to be moved indoors or a pond heater might be necessary.
• Water lettuce prefers nutrient-rich water. In ponds without fish,
supplementing with a water-soluble fertilizer could be beneficial.


• The water lettuce should be regularly inspected for signs of pests or diseases.
Yellowing or browning leaves can indicate problems. Early detection allows
for prompt intervention and maintenance of healthy plants.
• Water lettuce reproduces rapidly and can quickly cover the water surface.
Regular pruning is crucial to ensure sufficient light reaches other plants and
pond life.
2.7.4.2 Potential uses of water Lettuce
While traditionally considered a management concern, harvested water lettuce (Pistia
stratiotes) presents an opportunity for resource recovery within wastewater treatment
facilities. Here's an exploration of its potential applications:
Composting: A straightforward approach, water lettuce can be composted alone or cocomposted
with
other
organic
substrates
to
generate
nutrient-rich
soil
amendments(HASSAN et al., 2023).
Anaerobic Digestion: In large-scale operations, water lettuce can be utilized as a
feedstock for biogas production through anaerobic digestion. This process yields
methane, a renewable energy source, along with digestate, a nutrient-rich byproduct
with fertilizer potential.
Livestock Feedstock (with Caution): Water lettuce offers some nutritional value and
can be incorporated as a supplementary feed for swine, rabbits, or aquaculture(Shi et
al., 2022). However, its low protein content and presence of oxalic acid necessitate
careful dietary management and consultation with animal nutritionists to avoid
potential health risks.


Vermicomposting: Water lettuce can be employed as a substrate for vermicomposting
systems(Cong et al., 2022). Earthworms readily consume it, ultimately producing highquality vermicompost rich in both macro and micronutrients, as well as beneficial
microbial populations.




CHAPTER THREE: METHODOLOGY
3.1 Introduction
This chapter highlights the systematic steps taken during the study. The study
investigated the potential of water lettuce (Pistia stratiotes L.) to enhance treatment
efficiency in the maturation pond at Kakoba Waste stabilization Ponds. Baseline
conditions were established by both assessing secondary and collection and analysis of
primary data. Water lettuce was introduced and monitored. By comparing postimplementation effluent quality to baseline data, treatment performance was
assessed. Finally, Cost effectiveness of this approach was assessed.

3.2.1 Assessment of Secondary data.
This study benefited from data provided by National Water and Sewage Corporation
(NWSC) about the design considerations, treatment methods currently used, historical
problems and anomalies or occurrences and operational challenges, Pond dimensions
(depth, area and size) of Kakoba WSP, Appendix B-3 and Appendix B-4. This
information gave a valuable foundation for understanding the existing treatment system
and its limitations.

Three full scale ponds which include Primary Facultative Pond, the First Maturation
Pond and the Last Maturation Pond connected in series were investigated during a
period 28 weeks from September 2023 to March 2024 by the staff of NWSC. This was
done by analysis of secondary data obtained from The Quality Control Offices NWSC


Mbarara Ruhuro Works Located opposite Nile Breweries Plant. The Data clearly stated
the Quality of raw sewage and the final effluent over a period of 25 moths, Appendix
B-6 and Appendix B-7.
This data covered the tests that had been carried out period before during and after
de-sludging was done. Before that the ponds had not been de-slugged in over 9 years.
From this data it was observed that station Infleunt and effluent caliber were assessed
and the study was inclined more to organic traits of the wastewater. These were mainly
portrayed by BOD. Among others, parameters like T.P and T.N were assessed.
3.3 Primary Data
To ascertain the existing removal efficiency of Kakoba Waste Stabilization Ponds, a
study was conducted to determine the current removal rates of BOD, TN and Total
Phosphorous.
3.3.1 Sample Collection
Clean plastic samples were labelled and rinsed with distilled water and then used for
the sampling process. They were labelled Raw Sewage, Anaerobic Pond, Facultative
Pond and maturation pond. Grab samples of waste water were collected from 4 key
sampling points to say, inlet to the primary the inlet and out let of the primary
facultative pond, the outlet of the first maturation pond and the outlet of the second
maturation/polishing pond, Figure A-4. This ascertained obtaining of the
characteristics of the influent and effluent waste water existing in each pond of the
treatment system and that of the effluent exiting the ponds.


The samples were collected in January and in March. In January, the samples were
collected twice a day, in the morning and at noon. Thrice a day on 30th March, 2024.

3.3.2 Sample Preservation
Some of the samples were assessed on site for Temperature and pH using Palin test pH
pocket meter. The samples were carefully stored in a cooler box at a temperature of
26°C To minimize any alterations of the concentrations of the samples in each
container. They were then transported to the NWSC laboratory, Ruhuro for analysis of
BOD, TN and TP. The methods used are summarized in Table 3.2.

BOD analysis
• Sample collection: 4 samples from the inlet of the Primary facultative pond, its
outlet and from the inlets and outlets of the two maturation ponds; were
collected using clean BOD bottles (300ml). The bottles were filled completely to
minimize air bubbles. Sample collection was done in the morning, at noon day
and in the evening.
• The samples collected in the morning and in the afternoon were stored at a
temperature of 40C while waiting to collect the evening samples.
• Sample preparation: To ensure the final DO level remained above a minimum
threshold after incubation, dilution water free of oxygen and with similar pH to
the sample was used. The dilution water was seeded with the microbiological
population responsible for degrading organic matter.
• Initial DO Measurement: using a properly calibrated DO meter the concentration
of DO was quantified for both the diluted samples and the blank sample (dilution
water only).
• Incubation: BOD bottles were filled with diluted samples and one with blank
ensuring no air bubbles remained. The bottles were then sealed tightly to


prevent exchange of oxygen with the atmosphere. The bottles were incubated
for 5 days in an oven at 200C.
• Final DO measurement: After incubation, the DO concentrations of the
incubated samples and blanks was measured using the method.
• Calculations: BOD was calculated using the difference between the initial DO
value and the Final DO together multiply by the dilution factor.
TP analysis
• Sample preparation: to determine the total phosphorous content of the sample
(both dissolved and particulate fractions) the samples were acidified with HCl to
a pH of 2. This was done to preserve the integrity of the sample and ensure
accurate measurement.
• Chemical reactions: Ammonium molybdate and potassium antimonyl tartrate
reacted with orthophosphate in an acidic medium forming hetropoly acid known
as phosphomolybdic acid.
