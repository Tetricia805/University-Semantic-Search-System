The research is about exploring the perceptions and practices of Ugandan SMES in
Kabale municipality regarding social media for brand boosting. The objectives of the
study were identifying the social media platforms most commonly used by Ugandan
SMEs for brand building, analyze the strategies and practices employed by Ugandan
SMEs to enhance their brand image and engagement on social media, identify the
main challenges faced by Ugandan SMEs in utilizing social media for brand boosting
and understand how Ugandan SMEs measure the effectiveness of their social media
efforts in terms of brand building.
The research employed a descriptive case study approach to qualitatively
investigate how chosen SMEs in Kabale Municipality utilize social media for brand
enhancement, incorporating both primary and secondary information sources. The
target population included SME owners, social media managers, and customers in
Kabale Municipality. Purposeful sampling was applied to select 20 SMEs that actively
participate in social media branding. Interview guides facilitated the collection of
qualitative data from SME managers and marketers, while focus group discussions
(FGDs) were held with SME staff and social media followers to gain insights into their
shared perceptions and experiences concerning SME branding strategies on social
media.
During a focus group discussion with SME employees and social media followers in
Kabale Municipality, they indicated that Facebook was the predominant platform for
brand development

CHAPTER ONE. INTRODUCTION
1.0 Introduction
The chapter provides the following subsections of information on the title,
introduction, background, problem statement, research objectives and questions;
scope, justification of the study, its significance as well as the theoretical framework.
1.1 Background to the Study
Most SMEs quantitatively tracked the effectiveness of social media by counting
increases in followers, likes, comments, and shares. While those provided at least some
level of brand attention and interaction insight, they were deficient in depicting
additional audience action or sales impact. Customer ratings and testimonies generated
qualitative information but were not formally summarized into performance analysis.
Physical signals such as sales leads that were linked with social media campaigns used
to be the ultimate sign of brand success, and systematic monitoring systems were
unheard of. The intermittent usage of licensed analytics software such as Facebook
Insights was due to limited availability, expertise, and time. This didn't allow SMEs to
think of optimization of campaigns or return on investment.
Despite these challenges, SMEs expressed interest in building more data literacy and
analysis capability. Internal most critical monitoring practices were in the process of
undergoing changes but were not quite there yet. This means an in-between state in
which SMEs realize the importance of measurement but lack adequate capability for
full implementation. Filling this gap is critical for future success in digital marketing.

Additionally, the entrepreneurial activities of young Africans are increasingly reliant on
social media platforms, making digital branding a transformation for the generation.
Young entrepreneurs are launching fashion, art, and food brands solely online through
Instagram and TikTok (Ndyali, 2018). These platforms facilitate real-time storytelling,
visual promotions, and customer testimonials—crucial for building brand trust. A study
by Boateng (2019) showed that young African entrepreneurs view social media not just
as a marketing tool but as an essential element of their business strategy. Even though
large corporations dominate traditional media, small and medium-sized enterprises are
finding a level playing field through social networks. The gradual democratization of
marketing power is changing Africa’s business landscape. Understanding these trends is
essential for developing tailored strategies for small businesses in local environments.
In East Africa, social media has emerged as a transformative SME marketing and
branding tool. The digital entrepreneurship sector in Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda has
grown remarkably, primarily due to youth and mobile access to the Internet (Mutuku &
Odhiambo, 2020). More than 80% of small and medium-sized Kenyan enterprises utilize
at least a single social media platform for marketing, as indicated by a report by the
Kenya National Bureau of Statistics in 2019. WhatsApp and Facebook have emerged as
favorites given the large network of users and the low cost. Small and medium-sized
organisations in Tanzania use WhatsApp groups and Insta Stories for product promotion
and receiving orders immediately (Ndiege, 2019). The use of these platforms is
transforming conventional marketing practices and generating new brand development
prospects. Nevertheless, numerous SME operators in the region still do not possess
sophisticated technical expertise and digital policy.

In Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi, there is increased use of social media for branding,
albeit at a slow level due to infrastructure and education challenges. In Uganda, small
and medium entities have taken to Facebook to market local crafts, fashion, and
services more and more (Kalemera, 2018). A survey by Kira Digital Uganda in 2020
established that 60% of SMEs using social media recorded improved awareness of
customers on products. Nevertheless, issues like absence of social media training,
absence of brand management expertise, and irregular online participation were noted.
In Rwanda, the government drives digital inclusion by ICT policies promoting SMEs
(Rwabizambuga, 2018). Such community initiatives have a bright outlook for the use of
social media, but issues arise hindering total success in enhancing brand visibility.
Furthermore, throughout East Africa, youth-run centers are rising to assist SMEs in
digital branding expertise. The likes of Nairobi Garage, The Innovation Village in
Uganda, and BongoHive in Zambia provide workshops on how to enhance a brand with
digital means (Muchira, 2018). The centers have provided an environment from which
even small undertakings are able to create professional brands and compete in the
digital marketplace. Studies by Turyakira and Mbidde (2019) indicated that SMEs
embracing digital models in East Africa showed improved access to markets and greater
customer loyalty. Social media has connected the remotest regions, allowing
undertakings in isolated regions to participate in urban and global markets. As the
region adopts digital evolution, more SMEs are adjusting business models to incorporate
online branding models. The trend presents a change in marketing momentum in the
region due to digital connectivity

In Uganda, SME usage of social media has progressively risen in the last five years with
rising mobile phone ownership and urbanization. In 2019, Uganda Communications
Commission (UCC) indicated that more than 18 million Ugandans utilized the internet,
and Facebook and WhatsApp were the most utilized platforms. The platforms have
emerged as indispensable for SMEs to market offers, interact with consumers, and
enhance visibility. Nakirya and Lwanga (2020) state that social media enables Ugandan
SMEs to create brand awareness without the expenditure of print and radio marketing.
The majority of the companies use informal marketing, and utilizing social media is a
hassle-free option. Not many SMEs have well-formed branding policies and continuous
online interactions. The situation has generated a disconnect between digital branding's
promise and its real impact in Uganda.
Urbans SMEs in cities such as Kampala, Mbarara, and Gulu have more use of social media
for branding than SMEs in rural locations. The disparity is explained by better access to
the internet, improved digital literacy, and more access to smartphones (Kasozi &
Lubega, 2019). In Kampala restaurants and fashion houses use Instagram to display
product images and respond to customers' queries. WhatsApp status updates and
Facebook pages provide platforms for collections of products, client ratings, and brand
messages. A study by Mpiima (2018) indicated that SMEs using social media recorded a
20–30% increase in inquiries and interaction from customers. Though such interaction
rose sharply, few SMEs have branding efforts or measure success using analytics. This
makes the use of social media less effective in the long term for building brands.
Uganda's ministry of ICT started programs on digital skill training for small business
enterprise leaders, but uptake remains low among SME establishments. The majority of

the training programs are donor-initiated and have weak linkage with local businessdevelopment plans (Wamala, 2019). Additionally, the costs of using the internet and
cybersecurity challenges inhibit many small business establishments from complete use
of online branding. Lack of understanding of branding basics contributes to inconsistent
messages, uninspiring visual aspects, and limited customer interaction. As a result,
although universal access exists for the use of social media, strategic use of such for
enhancing brand visibility remains low among urban SME establishments such as those
established in Kampala, Mbarara, and Gulu. The urban-rural disparity results from
better access to the internet, improved digital literacy, and access to smartphones
(Kasozi & Lubega, 2019). In Kampala city, restaurants and fashion houses utilize
Instagram for posting product photographs and customers' responses. WhatsApp's use of
status and Facebook pages give avenues for products lists and customers and brand
ratings and brand updates. Studies by Mpiima (2018) indicated SME establishments using
social media achieving a 20–30% increase in questions and responses from customers.
Despite such an increase, few SME establishments use branding methodologies or check
performance using analytics. The latter makes the use of social media less effective as
a sustainable brand-development tool.
Uganda's Ministry of ICT has started training small business operators on digital skills,
but SME uptake is not significant. Training programs offered have mostly been
influenced by donors and do not harmonize well with national plans of business
development (Wamala, 2019). Besides, expenditure on use of the internet and
cybersecurity issues deters many small operators from adopting fully online branding.
Incorrect comprehension of branding basics takes the form of inconsistent
communication, poor visual elements, and poor customer involvement. Hence,

strategic utilisation for improvement of brand visibility with high penetration of social
media isn't fully realized. SME operators in Uganda need assistance on social media
strategy, content, and brand position for more effectiveness. Such measures are critical
in transforming awareness into loyalty and driving sustainable business expansion
In Kabale Municipality, SMEs have increasingly adopted use of social media but it is
mostly informal and not well researched. Most business entities such as salons, tailoring
shops, and mobile money agents utilize WhatsApp statuses and Facebook groups to
advertise services (Turyatunga, 2020). Lack of well-developed branding and quality
production of content however hampers effective brand positioning. The vast majority
of SMEs rely on word of mouth or posters inside shops, occasionally using social media.
Digital marketing is perceived more as an alternative resource rather than a genuine
investment. The low usage of Instagram and Twitter implies local SMEs have not yet
utilized the various outlets of social media at their disposal. The opportunity for further
analysis of local tradition and challenges is made.
Young people in Kabale have been at the vanguard of innovative use of social media,
specifically in business sectors like fashion, entertainment, and smallholder agriculture.
The proprietors of small business use smartphones and low-cost plans for chat and
negotiating with customers inside and outside the city (Byamukama, 2019). Facebook
pages and WhatsApp groups are used extensively to market second-hand clothing,
crafts, and phone accessories. However, the vast majority of business establishments
suffer from the inability to have steady branding and working models of customer
interaction. Surveys of business proprietors in Kabale reflect the desire to utilize social
media more efficiently; however, a lack of skill, facilitation, and training impedes it.

Most business entities also lack logos, taglines, and histories of brand that would attract
online visibility. Therefore, education on branding is appropriate for the local setting
and critical.
Kabale's standing as a growing urban center and access to education services and
potential for tourism offers SMEs an untapped market on social media. Firms with target
groups of students at the university or tourist clientele have potential for successful
digital brand campaigns (Tumwesigye, 2018). Infrastructure setbacks like slow network
connectivity and inconsistent power supply remain hindrances. Partnerships among
local government and SMEs for digital literacy and innovation hubs remain limited.
Improving support systems may enable SMEs in Kabale to leverage more on social media
for brand improvement. Research plays a crucial role in assessing current practices,
attitudes, and potential responses. This study shall fill the knowledge gap and increase
SME potential by harnessing platforms on social media effectively
1.2 Problem Statement
Over the past few years, social media has become a critical means of brand expansion
for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) worldwide.
In Uganda, especially in urban centers like Kabale Municipality, increasing use of mobile
phones and internet connectivity have created additional avenues for SMEs to utilize
social media platforms like Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram to promote their
businesses. Despite the convenience of access to these platforms, most SMEs in Kabale
fail to leverage social media in a way that fosters sustainable brand growth. While some
businesses post advertisements online from time to time, few businesses embark on
sustained, strategic branding that builds customer loyalty, market visibility, or

competitiveness. Low digital capabilities, poor branding competency, low levels of
access to affordable training, and inadequate infrastructure constrain SMEs' complete
adoption of social media marketing. In addition, there is limited empirical work that
examines the attitudes of SMEs in Kabale regarding the use of social media and how
they incorporate it into their business models. With this information unavailable, SMEs
might not understand the competitive strengths provided by digital branding. The
absence of properly structured support mechanisms and policy guidelines holds SMEs
back from realizing the full potentials of social media websites. It intends to explore
the perspectives and behaviors of Ugandan SMEs operating in Kabale Municipality
towards the use of social media for brand promotion. It will establish gaps in knowledge,
skills, and practices and provide insights to be utilized in capacity building, policy
development, and facilitation of local digital entrepreneurship. It is important to
understand these dynamics to enable SMEs to enhance their brands, grow their
customer base, and compete in the online market effectively
1.3 Purpose of the Study

brand boosting in Kabale Municipality.
