Solution to Non-Linear Equations

Introduction
6.1.1
Motivation
Given a second degree polynomial, we can accurately compute it’s root, that is
ax2 + bx + c = 0 ⇒x = −b ±
√
b2 −4ac
2a
But what if ax5 + bx4 + cx3 + dx2 + ex + f = 0 ⇒x =?, sin x + x = 0 ⇒x =?
6.1.2
Problem Description
• Given a non-linear equation f(x) = 0, find a x⋆such that f(x⋆) = 0. Thus, x⋆is a root
of f(x) = 0.
• Galois theory in math tells us that only polynomials of degree ≤4 can be solved with
close forms using +, −, ×, ÷ and taking roots.
• General non-linear equations can be solved with iterative methods.
• Basically, we try to guess the location of a root, and approximate it iteratively.
• Unfortunately, this process can go wrong, leading to another root or even diverge.
6.1.3
Methods to be discussed
• There are two types of methods, bracketing and open. The bracketing methods require
an interval that is known to contain a root, while the open method does not.
• Commonly seen bracketing methods include the Bisection method and the regula falsi
method, and the open methods are Newton’s method, the secant method, and the successive
substitution.

Newton Raphson’s Method
6.2.1
Derivation of the Newton’s method
If we are given a non-linear equation f(x) = 0 and we are to apply the Newton Raphson’s
method, we linear approximate the graph of y = f(x) by a straight line passing through the
point (x0, f0) and tangential to the graph of y = f(x). Take the slope of this line to be p.
Geometrically this is given in figure below.
Figure 6.1: Geometrical representation of a tangent to a curve at a point
The equation of the line with slope p and passing through the point (x0, f0) is
y −f0
x −x0
= p
(6.1)
However, we know that p is the slope of the tangent to y = f(x) at (x0, f0). This is given by;
p = f ′(x0) = f ′
(6.2)
Substituting equation (6.2) in equation (6.1) we get
y −f0
x −x0
= f ′
y −f0 = (x −x0)f ′
(6.3)
From figure 6.1, line of equation 13.3 cuts the x-axis at the point (x1, 0) i.e when x = x1 and
y = 0.
Substituting in equation (6.3) we get,
0 −f0 = (x1 −x0)f ′
Making x1 the subject, we get,
x1 = x0 −f0
f ′
or
x1 = x0 −f(x0)
f ′x0
(6.4)
Page 175 of 315

equation (6.4) is actually the Newton’s method for obtaining the next iterate x1 from the
previous iterate x0. The equation (6.4) is generalized and written;
(6.5)
since the linear approximation of the curve is done at each of the iterates xn, xn+1, xn+2, . . . as
reflected in figure above.
Example 6.2.1
Use Newton Raphson’s method to find the root of
x2 −3 = 0 on [1, 2]
.
f(xn) = x2
n −3
therefore
f ′(xn) = 2xn
But Raphson’s formula is
Substituting in the Raphson’s formula we get
xn+1 = xn −(x2
n −3)
2xn
= 2x2

Taking the initial guess/approximation as x0 = 2, but you could also consider x0 = 1 you come
up with the same answer.

Thus the root is 1.7320508

Example 6.2.2 Use Newton-Raphson Method to find the only real root of the equation
correct to 9 decimal places.
Since f(1) = −1 and f(2) = 5, the function has a root in the interval [1, 2] since the function
changes sign between [1, 2]. Let us make an initial guess x0 = 1.5.

The fewer the decimal places the faster the iteration scheme converges.

Find the root of the function

Example 6.2.6
Pitfall - no real root
Newton’s method will fail (the sequence {xn} does not converge) on solving
f(x) = x2 −4x + 5 = 0
since f does not have any real root.

Example 6.2.7
Find the root of
f(x) = 3x + sin x −ex = 0
in the interval [0, 1] numerically by the famous Newton Raphson’s method
Solution
Since f(0) = −1 < 0 and f(1) = 3 + sin(1) −e > 0, so there is a real root in [0, 1]. Using
= xn −(3xn + sin xn −exn)
(3 + cos xn −exn)

3 + cos xn −exn

x4 = x3 [cos x3 −ex3] −sin x3 + ex3
3 + cos x3 −ex3

3 + cos 0.36042 −e0.36042
= 0.36042
to 5 decimal places is 0.36042

Example 6.2.8
Pitfall - Alternating or oscillating solutions
Use Newton’s Method to find the only real root of the equation
f(x) = ex −2x = 0
with an initial guess of x0 = 1.
f(x) = ex −2x ⇒f(xn) = exn −2xn
f ′(x) = ex −2 ⇒f ′(xn) = exn −2
f ′(xn) = xn −exn −2xn
exn −2
= exn(xn −1)

x1 = ex0(x0 −1)

e1 −2
= 0
x2 = ex1(x1 −1)
ex1 −2
e0 −2
= 1
x3 = ex2(x2 −1)

e1 −2
= 0
x4 = ex3(x3 −1)
ex3 −2
e0 −2
= 1
x5 = ex4(x4 −1)
ex4 −2
e1 −2
= 0
x6 = ex5(x5 −1)
ex5 −2
e0 −2
= 1
...
...
Its an alternating solutions, the solutions oscillate near the local maxima or local minima.
In other words, Newton’s Method fails to produce a solution. Why is this? Because there is no
solution to be found!
Mathematicians are often very happy when, after a great deal of work, they are just able to
say that a solution to a problem exists. This is because once they know it exists, there might
be some nice method, such as Newton’s Method, to actually compute the solution.

Example 6.2.9
Pitfall - Diverging sequence
When Newton’s method is applied to
f(x) = xe−x
with x0 = 2, it produces
n

f(xn)

2.70671 × 10−1

7.32626 × 10−2

26.00660
1.31995 × 10−10
27.04659
4.85206 × 10−11
Note that,
• The sequence {xn} diverges to ∞slowly;
• However, f(xn) goes to zero rapidly as xn gets larger in a finite precision environment, and
could be mistaken as a zero of f.
Definition 6.2.1
Convergence of Newton’s Method
If the iterations are getting closer and closer to the correct answer the method is said to converge.
That is, the Newton’s method is said to converge if |xn+1 −xn| →0.
Remark 6.2.3
However, Newton’s method will not converge if
1.) If f ′(xn) = 0 for some n
2.) If lim
n→∞xn does not exist
Page 181 of 315

Example 6.2.10
Pitfall - Interval size
If the numerical When Newton’s method applied to
f(x) = x3 −x −3

= xn −x3

with x0= 0, it produces
x1 = −3.00000
x2 = −1.96154
x3 = −1.14718
x4 = −0.00658
x5 = −3.00039
x6 = −1.96182
x7 = −1.14743
The sequence will not converge. But if the algorithm starts with x0= 2, then it produces
x1 = 1.7272727
x2 = 1.6736912
x3 = 1.6717026
x4 = 1.6716999
x5 = 1.6716999
The sequence converges to the root 1.6716999 correct to seven decimal places.
This examples illustrates again that the starting point x0 must be close enough to the zero of
f.

Example 6.2.11
Pitfall - Choice of x0 and f ′(x) = 0
Use the Newton Method to find a non-zero solution of
x = 2 sin x
(6.6)
Let f(x) = x −2 sin x. Then f ′(x) = 1 −2 cos x, and the Newton-Raphson iteration is
f ′(xn) = xn −xn −2 sin xn
1 −2 cos xn
= 2 (sin xn −xn cos xn)
1 −2 cos xn
Let x0= 1.1. The next six estimates, to 3 decimal places, are:
x1 = 8.453
x2 = 5.256
x3 = 203.384
x4 = 118.019
x5 = −87.471
x6 = −203.637
Things don’t look good, and they get worse. It turns out that x35 < −64000000. We could be
stubborn and soldier on. Miracles happen-but not often. (One happens here, around n = 212.)
The trouble was caused by the choice of x0, let us consider x0= 1.5. Here are the next six
estimates, to 19 decimal places - to indicate how fast the convergence is
x1 = 2.0765582006304348291
x2 = 1.9105066156590806258
x3 = 1.8956220029878460925
x4 = 1.8954942764727706570
x5 = 1.8954942670339809987
x6 = 1.8954942670339809471
The next iterate x7 agrees with x6 in the first 19 decimal places, indeed in the first 32, and the
true root is equal to x6 to 32 decimal places.
Remark 6.2.4
Note that choosing
x0 = π
3 ≈1.0472
leads to immediate disaster, since then the denominator f ′(x) = 1 −2 cos x0 = 0 and therefore
x1 does not exist.
Comment 6.2.1
The remedy to this is to rewrite the Equation (6.6) into other forms say
x −
sin x = 0 or sin x
x
= 1
works nicely - to have f ′(x) harder to be too small or almost zero for ∀x ∈(0, π) - as we shall
see in the section of successive substitution, Section 6.6

Example 6.2.12
Consider the problem of finding the positive number x with cos x = x3 We
can rephrase that as finding the zero of
f(x) = cos x −x3 ⇒f ′(x) = −sin x −3x2
Since cos x ≤1 for all x and x3 > 1 for x > 1, we know that our zero lies in [0, 1]. We try a
starting value of x0 = 0.5.

Roots of Positive Numbers
Suppose that our interest is to find the rth root of a real positive number A. If x is the value
of this root, then x is related to A by the equation,
A
r = x or xr = A or xr −A = 0
Let f(x) = xr −A, then x is the root of the nonlinear equation,
f(x) = xr −A = 0, ⇒f(xn) = xr
n −A, ⇒f ′(xn) = rxr−1

Equation (6.7) is a general formula from which we can obtain quadratically convergent iterative
processes for finding approximations to arbitrary roots of numbers.
Note 6.2.1
The root, or answer interested in is the x. And also what is f(x) is the function
f(x) = 0
Example 6.2.14
When r = 2, the square root of a number A we have
x =

Which is the Newton’s square root algorithm for extracting roots of positive numbers.

But x4 = 2.236068 is exactly the same as x3. In fact they are exactly the same up to nine
This means that x4 = 2.236068 is the value of the root correct to nine decimal places. Thus
x4, must also be correct up to six decimal places.
Hence, the value of the root that you state as being correct to six decimal places or nine decimal
places is x4 = 2.236068. Compare with the value obtained from calculator.

xn+1 = xn(2 −Axn)
This formula is quadratically convergent and can suitably be applied to calculate the reciprocal
of numbers.
Example 6.2.17
Use Newton’s reciprocal algorithm to find the reciprocal of 3.
xn+1 = xn(2 −Axn) ⇒xn+1 = xn(2 −3xn)
or, using the formula, since finding

6.2.4
Failures of Newton’s Method
Typically, Newton’s method is used to find roots fairly quickly. However, things can go wrong.
Some reasons why Newton’s method might fail include the following:
1. At one of the approximations xn, the derivative f ′ is zero at xn, but f(xn) ̸= 0. As a result,
the tangent line of f at xn does not intersect the x-axis. Therefore, we cannot continue the
iterative process.
2. The approximations x0, x1, x2, . . . may approach a different root. If the function f has more
than one root, it is possible that our approximations do not approach the one for which we
are looking, but approach a different root (see Figure below).
Figure 6.2: If the initial guess x0 is too far from the root sought, it may lead to approximations
that approach a different root.
This event most often occurs when we do not choose the approximation x0 close enough to
the desired root.
3. The approximations may fail to approach a root entirely. In Example 6.2.18 , we provide an
example of a function and an initial guess x0 such that the successive approximations never
approach a root because the successive approximations continue to alternate back and forth
between two values.
Example 6.2.18
Consider the function f(x) = x3 −2x + 2. Let x0 = 0. Show that the
sequence x1, x2, . . . fails to approach a root of f.
For f(x) = x3 −2x + 2, the derivative is f ′(x) = 3x2 −2. Therefore,
x1 = x0 −f(x0)
f ′(x0) = 0 −f(0)
f ′(0) = −2
−2 = 1.
In the next step,
x2 = x1 −f(x1)
f ′(x1) = 1 −f(1)
f ′(1) = 1 −1
1 = 0.
Consequently, the numbers x0, x1, x2, . . . continue to bounce back and forth between
0 and 1 and never get closer to the root of f which is over the interval [−2, −1] .
Page 190 of 315

Figure 6.3: The approximations continue to alternate between 0 and 1 and never approach the
root of f.
Fortunately, if we choose an initial approximation x0 closer to the actual root, we
can avoid this situation.
■
Exercise 6.2.7
For f(x) = x3 −2x + 2, let x0 = −1.5 and find x1 and x2.
x1 ≈−1.842105263
x2 ≈−1.772826920
■
Note 6.2.2 From Example 6.2.18, we see that Newton’s method does not always work. However, when it does work, the sequence of approximations approaches the root very quickly.
Discussions of how quickly the sequence of approximations approach a root found using Newton’s method are included in texts on numerical analysis.
6.2.5
Advantages of Newton Raphson’s Method
• A faster method for converging on a single root of a function is the Newton- Raphson method.
• Perhaps it is the most widely used method of all locating formulas.
• Because the convergence rate is high, no worry for initial guess, interval size, and number of
decimal places required.
• Requires only one guess
Page 191 of 315

6.2.6
Limitations of Newton Raphson’s Method
Good though it is, the method has some limitations.
• The Newton Raphson’s method may also fail if f(x) has a point of inflection in the neighborhood of the root.
• Newton’s method is an extremely powerful technique, but it has a major weakness: the need
to know the value of the derivative of f at each approximation.
• Frequently, f ′(x) is far more difficult and needs more arithmetic operations to calculate than
f(x).
• If in the immediate neighborhood of a root of f(x), f ′(x) vanishes or is very small, the
Newton Raphson’s method will not converge. The reason for this failure is; since f ′(x) is
very small, the quantity, −f(xn)
f ′(xn) becomes very large. In case it is zero - the denominator,
then function is not defined. The consequence is that we are thrown away from the root we
are approximating.

Example 6.2.19
1.) The convergence of the Newton-Raphson method technique highly depends on the initial
guess. Discuss.
Yes, when the initial guess is in the interval given, the iterations
converge faster than otherwise.

Bisection Method (Interval Halving)
6.3.1
Background
The bisection method is one of the bracketing methods for finding roots of equations.
6.3.2
Implementation
Given a function f(x) and an interval which might contain a root, perform a predetermined
number of iterations using the bisection method.
6.3.3
Limitations
Investigate the result of applying the bisection method over an interval where there is a discontinuity. Apply the bisection method for a function using an interval where there are distinct
roots. Apply the bisection method over a ”large” interval.
6.3.4
Explanation on the bisection method
The bisection method takes a similar geometrical approach with the Regula falsi algorithm.
You need two initial guesses x0 and x1 to the root x⋆of the nonlinear equation f(x) = 0, such
that
f(x0)f(x1) < 0
The next approximation is obtained by getting the arithmetic mean of the previous two. That
is
(6.8)
However, the pair xn, xn+1 to be used to get xn+2 must satisfy the condition
f(xn)f(xn−1) < 0
(6.9)
Masenge (1989) called this method a trivial simplification of the regula falsi.
In mathematics, the bisection method is a root-finding algorithm which works by repeatedly
dividing an interval in half and then selecting the subinterval in which the root exists.
Page 194 of 315

Example 6.3.1
Use the Bisection method to estimate the root of x2 = 3 on (1, 2).
The non linear function x2 −3 = 0 ⇒f(x) = x2 −3
Let
x0 = 1 ⇒f0 = −2.000 < 0
x1 = 2 ⇒f1 = 1.000 > 0
For the Bisection scheme,
= 1 + 2
= 1.500 ⇒f2 = −0.75 < 0
= 1.500 + 2.000
= 1.750 ⇒f3 = 0.062 > 0
= 1.750 + 1.500
= 1.625 ⇒f4 = −0.359 < 0
= 1.625 + 1.750
= 1.688 ⇒f5 = −0.151 < 0
= 1.688 + 1.750
= 1.719 ⇒f6 = −0.045 < 0
x7 = x6 + x3
= 1.719 + 1.750
= 1.735 ⇒f7 = 0.010 > 0
= 1.735 + 1.719
= 1.727 ⇒f8 = −0.017 < 0
x9 = x8 + x7
= 1.727 + 1.735
= 1.731 ⇒f9 = −0.004 < 0
x10 = x9 + x7
= 1.731 + 1.735
= 1.733 ⇒f10 = 0.003 > 0
x11 = x10 + x9
= 1.733 + 1.731
= 1.732 ⇒f11 = 0.000
Since f11 = 0.000, then x11 = 1.732 it is the root or zero of the function x2 −3 = 0, that is the
approximated square root of 3 correct to three decimal places.
Page 195 of 315

Example 6.3.2
Compute the numerical root of
using the Bisection method on the interval [0, 0.5] correct to 4 decimal places.
Let
x0 = 0 ⇒f0 = −1.0000 < 0
x1 = 0.5 ⇒f1 = 0.3307 > 0
For the Bisection scheme,
= 0 + 0.5
= 0.2500 ⇒f2 = −0.2866 < 0
= 0.2500 + 0.5000
= 0.3750 ⇒f3 = 0.0363 > 0
= 0.3750 + 0.2500
= 0.3125 ⇒f4 = −0.1219 < 0
= 0.3125 + 0.3750
= 0.3438 ⇒f5 = −0.0418 < 0
= 0.3438 + 0.3750
= 0.3594 ⇒f6 = −0.0026 < 0
x7 = x6 + x3
= 0.3594 + 0.3750
= 0.3672 ⇒f7 = 0.0169 > 0
= 0.3672 + 0.3594
= 0.3633 ⇒f8 = 0.0072 > 0
x9 = x8 + x6
= 0.3633 + 0.3594
= 0.3614 ⇒f9 = 0.0024 > 0
x10 = x9 + x6
= 0.3614 + 0.3594
= 0.3604 ⇒f10 = −0.0001 < 0
x11 = x10 + x9
= 0.3604 + 0.3614
= 0.3609 ⇒f11 = 0.0012 > 0
x12 = x11 + x10
= 0.3609 + 0.3604
= 0.3607 ⇒f12 = 0.0007 > 0
x13 = x12 + x10
= 0.3607 + 0.3604
= 0.3606 ⇒f13 = 0.0004 > 0
x14 = x13 + x10
= 0.3606 + 0.3604
= 0.3605 ⇒f14 = 0.0002 > 0
x15 = x14 + x10
= 0.3605 + 0.3604
= 0.3604 ⇒f15 = −0.0001 < 1
x16 = x15 + x14
= 0.3604 + 0.3605
= 0.3604
is approximately
0.3604
The exact solution is in fact 0.36044
Remark 6.3.1
The Bisection method takes long to converge.

6.3.5
Advantages of the Bisection method
• The method is simple.
• The method is always convergent.
6.3.6
Disadvantages of the Bisection method
• It requires the values of a = x0 and b = x1.
• The convergence of interval halving is very slow (slow at converging to the root x⋆). For
example, a simple non linear equation
x3 −x −2
will converge to about 1.521 after 15-fifteen iterations.
• The method fails in case of approximating a double root or a root of even multiplicity.
• A faster method for converging on a single root of a function is the Newton-Raphson
iteration Method.

Example 6.3.3
Using the Bisection algorithm, find the root of
cos x −xex = 0
correct to 3 decimal places on the interval 0 ≤x ≤1
Let x0 = 0 ⇒f0 = 1.000 > 0 and x1 = 1 ⇒f1 = −2.178 < 0, for the Bisection scheme,
= 0 + 1
= 0.500 ⇒f2 = 0.053 > 0
= 0.500 + 1.000
= 0.750 ⇒f3 = −0.856 < 0
= 0.750 + 0.500
= 0.625 ⇒f4 = −0.357 < 0
x5 = x4 + x2
= 0.625 + 0.500
= 0.562 ⇒f5 = −0.140 < 0
x6 = x5 + x2
= 0.562 + 0.500
= 0.531 ⇒f6 = −0.041 < 0
x7 = x6 + x2
= 0.531 + 0.500
= 0.516 ⇒f7 = 0.005 > 0
= 0.516 + 0.531
= 0.524 ⇒f8 = −0.019 < 0
x9 = x8 + x7
= 0.524 + 0.516
= 0.520 ⇒f9 = −0.007 < 0
x10 = x9 + x7
= 0.520 + 0.516
= 0.518 ⇒f10 = −0.001 < 0
x11 = x10 + x7
= 0.518 + 0.516
= 0.517 ⇒f11 = 0.002 > 0
x12 = x11 + x10
= 0.517 + 0.518
= 0.518 ⇒f12 = −0.001 < 0
x13 = x12 + x11
= 0.518 + 0.517
= 0.518
The scheme converges at x = 0.518. Analytically, the root is 0.5177

Example 6.3.4

f(x) = x3 −5x2 −2x + 10
using numerical Bisection method, if the graphical methods found the real root between x = 1
and x = 3:
Let
x0 = 1 ⇒f0 = 4.0000 > 0
x1 = 3 ⇒f1 = −14.0000 < 0
By interval halving,
= 3 + 1
= 2.0000 ⇒f2 = −6.0000 < 0
x3 = x2 + x0
= 2.0000 + 1.0000
= 1.5000 ⇒f3 = −0.8750 < 0
x4 = x3 + x0
= 1.5000 + 1.0000
= 1.2500 ⇒f4 = 1.6406 > 0
= 1.2500 + 1.5000
= 1.3750 ⇒f5 = 0.3965 > 0
= 1.3750 + 1.5000
= 1.4375 ⇒f6 = −0.2366 < 0
x7 = x6 + x5
= 1.4375 + 1.3750
= 1.4063 ⇒f7 = 0.0802 > 0
......
It is evident that the functional values f(xi) are approaching zero as the number of iterations
is increased.
After more six iteration the approximated root of 1.40625 compares favorably with the exact
value of

Remark 6.3.2
Thus, after the 11th iteration, we note that the final interval, [3.2958, 3.2968]
has a width less than 0.001 and |f(3.2968)| = 0.000025 < 0.001 and therefore we chose xe =
3.2968 to be our approximation of the root.
Although it is xm = 3.2963 in the last interval, but it is not the better approximation, since
scheme has not yet converged and yet |f(3.2963)| = 0.000035 a much more deviation from the
exact value 0.00000 compared to f(3.2968)
Remark 6.3.3 The Bisection scheme has not yet converged, but iteration terminated because
of the required error achieved.

Secant Method (Chords Method)
The Secant method needs two points near the root before the algorithm can be applied. Thus
it is of the form
xr+1 = f(xr, xr−1).
6.4.1
Derivation of the Secant method
We linear approximate the graph of y = f(x) in figure (10.1), by a chord passing through the
points A and B. The equation of this chord is,
The equation of the Chord is,
y = f(x1) = [f(x0) −f(x1)](x −x1)
x0 −x1
This Chord cuts the x-axis at x2 i.e.
−f(x1) = f(x0) −f(x1)
(x0 −x1)
(x2 −x1)
giving, x2 = x1 −f(x1)(x1 −x0)
or in general we have that,
xn+1 = g(xn, xn−1)
That is
xn+1 = xn −f(xn) [xn −xn−1]
xn+1 = xn [f(xn) −f(xn−1)] −f(xn) [xn −xn−1]
xn+1 = xnf(xn) −xnf(xn−1) −xnf(xn) + xn−1f(xn)
(6.10)
The error in the (n + 1)th iterate is related to the error in the nth iterate en by the relation
en+1 ≃Aek
n where k ≃1.618 . . . and A is a constant. This relation suggests that the method
has order of convergence 1.618.
Page 204 of 315

Example 6.4.1
Use the Secant method to find the root near 2 of the equation
x3 −2x −5 = 0
Start the iteration with x0 = 1.9, ⇒f(x0) = −1.941 and x1 = 2.0 ⇒f(x1) = −1.000.
= (1.9)(−1.000) −(2.0)(−1.941)
−1.000 −−1.941
= 2.10627,
f2 = 0.13166
= (2.0)(0.13166) −(2.10627)(−1.000)
0.13166 −−1.000
= 2.09391,
f3 = −0.00716
= (2.10627)(−0.00716) −(2.09391)(0.13166)
−0.00716 −0.13166
= 2.09455, f4 = −0.00002
= (2.09391)(−0.00002) −(2.09455)(−0.00716)
−0.00002 −−0.00716
= 2.09455
Thus since x4 and x5 are identical to 5 decimal places, so x5 = 2.09455 is the value of the root
correct to five decimal places.
Example 6.4.2
Estimate the root of
x4 −x −10 = 0
with the initial guess as 1.0 and 2.0 using the numerical Secant scheme. Take solutions to 5
Let
x0 = 1.0 ⇒f0 = −10.0
x1 = 2.0 ⇒f1 = 4.0
For the Secant rule
= (1.0)(4.0) −(2.0)(−10.0)
4.0 −−10.0
= 1.71429
⇒f2 = −3.07780
= (2.0)(−3.07780) −(1.71429)(4.0)
−3.07780 −4.0
= 1.83853
⇒f3 = −0.41283
= (1.71429)(−0.41283) −(1.83853)(−3.07780)
−0.41283 −−3.07780
= 1.85778
⇒f4 = 0.05401
= (1.83853)(0.05401) −(1.85778)(−0.41283)
0.05401 −−0.41283
= 1.85555
⇒f5 = −0.00085
= (1.85778)(−0.00085) −(1.85555)(0.05401)
−0.00085 −0.05401
= 1.85558
⇒f6 = −0.00011
= (1.85555)(−0.00011) −(1.85558)(−0.00085)
−0.00011 −−0.00085
= 1.85558
Page 205 of 315

So the iterative process converges at 1.85558
Note 6.4.1 If the function f(x) has a trigonometric term, the calculators better be in radians.
Example 6.4.3
Approximate the root of
x −sin x −1
2 = 0
Let the initial guess be 1.0 and 2.0 using the Secant algorithm.
Let x0 = 1.0 ⇒f0 = −0.34147 and x1 = 2.0 ⇒f1 = 0.59070
= (1.0)(0.59070) −(2.0)(−0.34147)
0.59070 −−0.34147
= 1.36632
⇒f2 = −0.11285
= (2.0)(−0.11285) −(1.36632)(0.59070)
−0.11285 −0.59070
= 1.46796
⇒f3 = −0.02676
= (1.36632)(−0.02676) −(1.46796)(−0.11285)
−0.02676 −−0.11285
= 1.49955
⇒f4 = 0.00209
= (1.46796)(0.00209) −(1.49955)(−0.02676)
0.00209 −−0.02676
= 1.49726
⇒f5 = −0.00004
= (1.49955)(−0.00004) −(1.49726)(0.00209)
−0.00004 −0.00209
= 1.49730
⇒f6 = 0.00000
= (1.49726)(0.00000) −(1.49730)(−0.00004)
−0.00000 −−0.00004
= 1.49730
So the iterative process converges at 1.49730, and it is almost exact.
Example 6.4.4
Let the initial guess be −2.0 and −1.0, find the root of
(x2 + 5x + 2)e−x + 1 = 0
using the Secant technique approximated to 5 decimal places.
Page 206 of 315

Let x0 = −2.0 ⇒f0 = −28.55622 and x1 = −1.0 ⇒f1 = −4.43656
= (−2.0)(−4.43656) −(−1.0)(−28.55622)
−4.43656 −−28.55622
= −0.81606
⇒f2 = −2.19865
= (−1.0)(−2.19865) −(−0.81606)(−4.43656)
−2.19865 −−4.43656
= −0.63535
⇒f3 = −0.45933
= (−0.81606)(−0.45933) −(−0.63535)(−2.19865)
−0.45933 −−2.19865
= −0.58763
⇒f4 = −0.06695
= (−0.63535)(−0.06695) −(−0.58763)(−0.45933)
−0.06695 −−0.45933
= −0.57949
⇒f5 = −0.00260
= (−0.58763)(−0.00260) −(−0.57949)(−0.06695)
−0.00260 −−0.06695
= −0.57916
⇒f6 = −0.00001
= (−0.57949)(−0.00001) −(−0.57916)(−0.00260)
−0.00001 −−0.00260
= −0.57916
The approximated zero of
(x2 + 5x + 2)e−x + 1 = 0
is
−0.57916
to five decimal places.

0.72878
0.56240
0.52478
0.51801
0.51776
0.51776
So the iterative process converges at 0.51776
Example 6.4.6 With initial conditions as x0 = 1.0 and x1 = 2.0, iterate with Secant method
to show that for
x −e−x = 0
the inexact solutions approximated to 5 decimal places are
x0

1.0
2.0
0.48714
0.58378
0.56739
0.56714
0.56714
So one of the roots of f(x) = x −e−x is approximately 0.56714
Example 6.4.7
Find the zero of the non linear equation
e−x = 3 log10 x

1.24682
So one of the roots of e−x = 3 log10 x is approximately 1.24682.
Hint: The function f(x) used is
f(x) = e−x −3 log10 x = 0

Use the Secant method to find a solution to x = cos x , and compare the
approximations with those given by Newton’s method with x0 = π/4.
For the Secant method we need two initial approximations.

Observations:
• For Newton’s method, an excellent approximation is obtained with n = 2
• Because of the agreement of x2 and x3 we could reasonably expect this result to be
accurate to the places listed.
• Comparing results, we see that the Secant Method approximation x4 is accurate to the
tenth decimal place, whereas Newton’s method obtained this accuracy by x2.
• Here, the convergence of the Secant method is much faster than functional iteration but
slightly slower than Newton’s method.

6.4.2
Advantages and Disadvantages of the Secant method
The method;
1.) can work for double roots.
2.) has order of convergence of 1.618.
3.) is not always convergent.
The above are advantages or disadvantages depending on the comparison technique in question.
Remark 6.4.1
The Secant method and Newton’s method are often used to refine an answer
obtained by another technique (such as the Bisection Method).
Exercise 6.4.1
Find the real root of
f(x) = x3 + x2 −3x −3 = 0
using Secant technique correct to 2 decimal places.
Exercise 6.4.2
Show that there is a root of the equation
f(x) = 3x −sin x −ex = 0
in the interval (0, 1). Estimate this root to 2 decimal places using the Secant method.
Exercise 6.4.3
Find the roots of the following equations, using the methods of Secant.
(a) ex = cos x
(b) x3 −2x + 1 = 0
(c) sin 2x −ex −1 = 0
(d) ln(x −1) = x2
Exercise 6.4.4
Use the Secant method to find the real root of the equation
x3 + 2x2 −x + 5 = 0.
Exercise 6.4.5
Consider obtaining the root of;
f(x) = ex + sin x
Show that f(1.9) < 0,
f(2.1) > 0 and use the Secant method to obtain the root.

6.5
The Regula-Falsi method (Method of false position)
The regula falsi algorithm uses two points near the root before the algorithm is applied (a
similar geometric approach like the Secant method-the regula falsi method is an associate of
the Secant method) with the exception that,
f(xr)f(xr−1) < 0
at each stage of the algorithm. This is termed as root bracketing, like in the Bisection method.
Thus to start the method, you need two points x0 = a0 and x1 = b0 near the root such that
f(a0)f(b1) < 0
That is f(a0) and f(b0) are of opposite signs, which implies by the intermediate value theorem
that the function f has a root in the interval [a0, b0], assuming continuity of the function f.
The method proceeds by producing a sequence of shrinking intervals [ak, bk] that all contain a
root of f.
6.5.1
Geometric representation and derivation of the Regula falsi
algorithm
Figure 6.4: The first two iterations of the false position method
From Figure (6.4) above, we note that the produce f(x0)(f(x1) < 0, which is in conformity
with the regula falsi. The equation of the Chord CD is,
y = f(x1) = [f(x0) −f(x1)](x −x1)
x0 −x1
This Chord cuts the x-axis at x2 i.e.
−f(x1) = f(x0) −f(x1)
(x0 −x1)
(x2 −x1)
giving, x2 = x1 −f(x1)(x1 −x0)
Page 211 of 315

or in general we have that,
xn+1 = g(xn, xn−1)
That is
xn+1 = xn −f(xn) [xn −xn−1]
xn+1 = xn [f(xn) −f(xn−1)] −f(xn) [xn −xn−1]
xn+1 = xnf(xn) −xnf(xn−1) −xnf(xn) + xn−1f(xn)
(6.11)
Equation (6.11) is the popular Regula false/falsi position method with condition that at each
stage of the algorithm,
f(xn)f(xn−1) < 0
(6.12)
Page 212 of 315

Example 6.5.1 Find the root between (2, 3) of x3 −2x−5 = 0, by using regula falsi method.
Approximate values to 3 decimal places.
Let us take x0 = 2 and x1 = 3.
f(x) = x3 −2x −5
f(x0) = f(2) = 23 −2(2) −5 = −1 < 0 (negative)
f(x1) = f(3) = 33 −2(3) −5 = 16 > 0 (positive)
The first approximation to root is x2 and is given by
= 2f(3) −(3)f(2)
f(3) −f(2)
= 2(16) −(3)(−1)
16 −(−1)
= 35
17 = 2.059
⇒f(2.059) = −0.389 < 0
The root lies between x2 = 2.059 and x1 = 3
Taking x2 = 2.059 and x1 = 3. we have the second approximation to the root given by
= (3)f(2.059) −2.059f(3)
f(2.059) −f(3)
= (3)(−0.389) −2.059(16)
(−0.389) −16
= 2.081
⇒f(2.081) = −0.150 < 0
The root lies between x3 = 2.081 and x1 = 3
Taking x3 = 2.081 and x1 = 3. we have the third approximation to the root given by
= (3)f(2.081) −2.081f(3)
f(2.081) −f(3)
= (3)(−0.150) −2.081(16)
(−0.15) −16
= 2.090
⇒f(2.090) = −0.051 < 0
The root lies between x4 = 2.090 and x1 = 3
Taking x4 = 2.090 and x1 = 3. we have the fourth approximation to the root given by
= (3)f(2.090) −2.090f(3)
f(2.090) −f(3)
= (3)(−0.051) −(2.090)(16)
(−0.051) −16
= 2.091
If we need a root to 3 decimal places, we could still continue with the iterations (the root lies
between x5 = 2.091 and x1 = 3), but if to 2 decimal places, the required root is 2.09
Page 213 of 315

Example 6.5.2
Approximate a root of
using the regula falsi scheme of solving non linear equations f(x) = 0 to 3 decimal places on
the interval [0, 0.5].
If we sketch the function f(x) it’s clear that there is a root between 0 and 0.5 and also another
root between 1.5 and 2.0. Now let us consider the function f(x) in the interval [0, 0.5] where
f(0) × f(0.5) is less than zero and use the regula-falsi scheme to obtain the zero of f(x) = 0.
Let x0 = 0.0 ⇒f0 = −1.000 < 0 and x1 = 0.5 ⇒f1 = 0.331 > 0
= (0.0)(0.331) −(0.5)(−1.000)

= 0.376, ⇒f2 = 0.039 > 0
x3 = x0f(x2) −x2f(x0)
f(x2) −f(x0)
= (0.0)(0.039) −(0.376)(−1.000)

= 0.362, ⇒f3 = 0.004 > 0
x4 = x0f(x3) −x3f(x0)
f(x3) −f(x0)
= (0.0)(0.004) −(0.362)(−1.000)
0.004 −−1.000
= 0.361, ⇒f4 = 0.001 > 0
x5 = x0f(x4) −x4f(x0)
f(x4) −f(x0)
= (0.0)(0.001) −(0.361)(−1.000)
0.001 −−1.000
= 0.360, ⇒f5 = −0.001 < 0
x5 = x4f(x5) −x5f(x4)
= (0.361)(−0.001) −(0.360)(0.001)
−0.001 −0.001
= 0.360
is approximately 0.360.

We observe that the value of the root as a third approximation is evidently different in both
the cases, while the value of x4, when the interval considered is (2, 3), is closer to the root.
Important observation: The initial interval (x0, x1) in which the root of the equation lies should
be sufficiently small.

Example 6.5.5
Use Regula-Falsi method to find a real root of the equation
ln x −cos x = 0
accurate to four decimal places after three successive approximations.
Let
x0 = 1.0 ⇒f0 = −0.540302 < 0
x1 = 2.0 ⇒f1 = 1.109 > 0
= (1.0)(1.109) −(2.0)(−0.540302)
1.109 −−0.540302
= 1.3275
⇒f2 = 0.0424 > 0
Next iteration to be for x0 and x2 since f0f2 < 0, change signs
x3 = x0f(x2) −x2f(x0)
f(x2) −f(x0)
= (1.0)(0.0424) −(1.3275)(−0.540302)
0.0424 −−0.540302
= 1.3037
⇒f3 = 0.001248 > 0
Next iteration to be for x0 and x3 since f0f3 < 0, change signs
x4 = x0f(x3) −x3f(x0)
f(x3) −f(x0)
= (1.0)(0.001248) −(1.3037)(−0.540302)
0.001248 −−0.540302
= 1.3030
The required real root is 1.3030
Note 6.5.1
The iterations have not converged, but we were interested in up to the third
iteration.
Note 6.5.2
For Matlab program for the non linear equation, we write ln x as log x, where as
log x as log10 x

Example 6.5.6
Use the method of false position to solve
ex + 2−x + 2 cos x −6 = 0 1 ≤x ≤2
correct your approximations to 4 decimal places.
Let
x0 = 1.0 ⇒f0 = −1.7011 < 0
x1 = 2.0 ⇒f1 = 0.8068 > 0
= (1.0)(0.8068) −(2.0)(−1.7011)
0.8068 −−1.7011
= 1.6783, ⇒f2 = −0.5457 < 0
= (2.0)(−0.5457) −(1.6783)(0.8068)
−0.5457 −0.8068
= 1.8081, ⇒f3 = −0.0858 < 0
= (2.0)(−0.0858) −(1.8081)(0.8068)
−0.0858 −0.8068
= 1.8265, ⇒f4 = −0.0118 < 0
= (2.0)(−0.0118) −(1.8265)(0.8068)
−0.0118 −0.8068
= 1.8290, ⇒f5 = −0.0016 < 0
= (2.0)(−0.0016) −(1.8290)(0.8068)
−0.0016 −0.8068
= 1.8293, ⇒f6 = −0.0003 < 0
= (2.0)(−0.0003) −(1.8294)(0.8068)
−0.0003 −0.8068
= 1.8294, ⇒f7 = 0.0001 > 0
x8 = x6f(x7) −x7f(x6)
f(x7) −f(x6)
= (1.8293)(0.0001) −(1.8294)(−0.0003)
0.0001 −−0.0003
= 1.8294
So the root of
ex + 2−x + 2 cos x −6 = 0
is approximately 1.8294 to 4 decimal places. Analytically, the exact value would be 1.82938.
Remark 6.5.1
Look back at how x8 was computed, how and why it was x6 and x7 paired
together, and not x7 with x1.

Example 6.5.7
Solve the equation
2x cos 2x −(x −2)2 = 0 2 ≤x ≤3
correct your approximations to 4 decimal places. Perform only four iterations.
Let
x0 = 2.0 ⇒f0 = −2.6146 < 0
x1 = 3.0 ⇒f1 = 4.7610 > 0
= (2.0)(4.7610) −(3.0)(−2.6146)
4.7610 −−2.6146
= 2.3545
⇒f2 = −0.1416 < 0
= (3.0)(−0.1416) −(2.3545)(4.7610)
−0.1416 −4.7610
= 2.3731
⇒f3 = 0.0212 > 0
= (2.3545)(0.0212) −(2.3731)(−0.1416)
0.0212 −−0.1416
= 2.3707
⇒f4 = 0.0001 > 0
x5 = x2f(x4) −x4f(x2)
f(x4) −f(x2)
= (2.3545)(0.0001) −(2.3707)(−0.1416)
0.0001 −−0.1416
= 2.3707
Remark 6.5.2
The scheme converges after the fourth iteration and converges to 2.3707.
In fact, one of the classical root of the non linear equation
2x cos 2x −(x −2)2 = 0
is
2.37069
Remark 6.5.3
In every next iteration, the previous point must be part of it.

Example 6.5.8
Using Regula-Falsi algorithm, approximate the real root of
f(x) = x3 −2x −2 = 0
Now since, f(1) = −3 < 0 and f(2) = 2 > 0 and f(x) is continuous for all real x, there exists
x⋆∈(1, 2) such that f(x⋆) = 0 (the intermediate value theorem).
Let x0 = 1.0 ⇒f0 = −3.00000 < 0 and x1 = 2.0 ⇒f1 = 2.00000 > 0,
= (1.0)(2.00000) −(2.0)(−3.00000)
2.00000 −−3.00000
= 1.60000, ⇒f2 = −1.10400 < 0
= (2.0)(−1.10400) −(1.60000)(2.00000)
−1.10400 −2.00000
= 1.74227
⇒f3 = −0.19587 < 0
= (2.0)(−0.19587) −(1.74227)(2.00000)
−0.19587 −2.00000
= 1.76526
⇒f4 = −0.02972 < 0
= (2.0)(−0.02972) −(1.76526)(2.00000)
−0.02972 −2.00000
= 1.76870
⇒f5 = −0.00438 < 0
= (2.0)(−0.00438) −(1.76870)(2.00000)
−0.00438 −2.00000
= 1.76921
⇒f6 = −0.00061 < 0
= (2.0)(−0.00061) −(1.76921)(2.00000)
−0.00061 −2.00000
= 1.76928
⇒f7 = −0.00009 < 0
x8 = x1f(x7) −x7f(x1)
f(x7) −f(x1)
= (2.0)(−0.00009) −(1.76928)(2.00000)
−0.00009 −2.00000
= 1.76929
⇒f8 = −0.00002 < 0
x9 = x1f(x8) −x8f(x1)
f(x8) −f(x1)
= (2.0)(−0.00002) −(1.76929)(2.00000)
−0.00002 −2.00000
= 1.76929
The numerical solution is therefore 1.76929 to five decimal points.

Example 6.5.9 Use the method of False Position to find a solution to x = cos x, and compare

Note 6.5.3
Note that the False Position and Secant approximations agree through x3 and
that the method of False Position requires an additional iteration to obtain the same accuracy
as the Secant method.
Remark 6.5.4
• The added insurance of the method of False Position commonly requires more calculation
than the Secant method, . . .
• just as the simplification that the Secant method provides over Newton’s method usually
comes at the expense of additional iterations.
Example 6.5.10
The function
f(x) = x2ex −1
has a root in the interval [0, 1] since f(0)f(1) < 0. The results from the false position and
secant methods, both started with x0 = 0 and x1 = 1, are shown in the table

It appears from these results that the secant method gives the correct result x = 0.7035 a little
more quickly.
6.5.2
Order of Convergence of the Regula algorithm
The error in the (n + 1)th iterate (denoted en+1) is related to the error in the nth iterate en by
the equation,
en+1 ≃Aek
n
where k = 1.
This suggests that although the regula falsi uses the same formula as the
Secant method, the order of convergence of the regula falsi is one compared to ≃1.618 for the
Secant. Thus, the method is slower at converging to the root compared to the Secant method.
However, with the condition f(xr)f(xr−1) < 0 at each stage, ensures that the regula falsi is
always convergent which is not the case with Secant method.

6.5.3
Advantages and disadvantages of the regula falsi algorithm
1.) The regula falsi algorithm is always convergent.
2.) The order of convergence of the method is one.
The two basic points on the advantages and disadvantages.
Whether it is an advantage or a disadvantage it all depends on the comparison in question. For
instance in comparison with the Secant method, it is disadvantageous that the regula falsi has
order of convergence one. While it is advantageous that it is always convergent.

to within 10−6 using the Regular Falsi method.
Summary 6.1
Increased number of decimal points and/or increased size of interval given
both increase the number of iterations as they increase.
However, increased number of decimal points and/or increased size of interval given both improve on the accuracy of the scheme.

6.6. SUCCESSIVE SUBSTITUTION (FIXED POINT METHOD)
6.6
Successive Substitution (Fixed Point Method)
6.6.1
Background knowledge
Successive substitution is one of the iterative techniques for solving nonlinear equations. Iterative techniques start with an initial value/guess x0 to the root α and then using a suitable recurrence relation we generate a sequence of approximations {xk}∞
k=o. If the sequence {x0, x1, . . .}
converges, then it does so on the required root. Iterative techniques are written in the form
xn+1 = g(xn),
n = 0, 1, 2, . . . ,
if the next iterate xn+1 depends on the previous one xn.
or xn+1 = gr(xn, xn−1), n = 1, 2, . . . ,
if the next iterate depends on the previous two i.e. xn and xn−1.
6.6.2
Successive Substitutions
In the method, we seek the roots of,
f(x) = 0.
(6.13)
We try to split f(x) in the form,
f(x) = x −g(x)
(6.14)
However, this splitting may not be unique. But not all the different splittings may be useful to
us. We can determine the type of splitting which is useful to a numerical analyst. Now, instead
of solving equation (6.13) we now solve x = g(x). The scheme for solving this problem is given
by the algorithm;
xn+1 = g(xn), n = 0, 1, 2, . . .
Thus we start with a suitable value x0, and generate the sequence of approximations
x1 = g(x0)
x2 = g(x1)
x3 = g(x2)
x4 = g(x3)
...
xn+1 = g(xn)
...
...
That is, the sequence is {x1, x2, . . . , xn, . . .}
