Residents of Bunyangabu District in Uganda have reportedly suffered from cases of dental fluorosis
due to consumption of water with high levels of Fluoride from Ntabago Stream. A household-level sand filter
incorporating crushed fired clay as an adsorbent was designed for a household to reduce the Fluoride
concentration in their drinking water from the natural raw water levels (2-3 mgF/L) to permissible, healthy
levels (0.5-1.0 mg/L). Pieces of fired clay bricks were crushed, and particles of 150 μm to 300 μm in size were
selectively obtained by sieving. Stream water was filtered through replicate model layered filter columns of the
prepared clay, sand (fine sand of 150 μm-2 mm; coarse sand of 2-5 mm), and gravel (6-15 mm). It was found
out that fired clay layers of 2.5 and 5 cm thick reduce the concentration of Fluoride in water by up to 74%, to
less than 1.0 mg/L. This was deduced by evaluating Fluoride concentration in both the clay and water before
and after filtration, using the SPADNS Colorimetric method. Use of crushed fired clay for reduction in
Fluoride concentration in drinking water is the focus of this paper. Additional work will optimise filter design
to improve overall water quality.
