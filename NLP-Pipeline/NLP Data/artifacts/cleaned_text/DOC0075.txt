ABSTRACT
The purpose of the study was to assess perception of health insurance uptake among university
students a case study of students undertaking a degree of business administration from the year
2:1 to 3:2 at Uganda Christian University Mukono.
The study was guided by the following research questions; determine the effect of awareness
levels among students regarding the health insurance packages available to them. To find out the
extent to which income affects the uptake of health insurance among students. To determine how
attitude affect the uptake of health insurance. To determine how government policies influence
the uptake of private health insurance in. To find out whether students’ gender has an influence
on uptake of health insurance.
The study used a case study of students undertaking a degree of business administration from the
year 2:1 to 3:2 at Uganda Christian University Mukono. The total population targeted for the
study was 403.110 students from BBA 3:1, 103 from BBA 3:2, 162 from BBA 2:2 and 28 form
BBA 2:1.
Primary data was collected using structured questionnaires. Quantitative data was analyzed and
the output was presented using a descriptive statistic of percentages. Qualitative data was
analyzed and the output was presented by narration.
The respondents agreed that health insurance is important and at a point beneficial for their
future wellbeing, but however think it is a risk investment. Many believe it has difficult and
undefined processes and also very expensive which makes it hard to maintain. Therefore this
study concludes that many university students enjoy having health insurance not from their
packets but that of their parents/ guardian and allowances from workplace.

CHAPTER ONE
1.1 Introduction
In the Late 19th century when insurance was first started in Uganda, insurance market had a few
mainly indemnity schemes most of which were provided by overseas insurers and a few local
underwriters and since then the health insurance has grown to be a bigger sector in Ugandan and
today it offers a number of schemes. Funding for health care has over the time become a
collective responsibility because of the importance of the facility and the rising costs of health
services. The Ugandan government has spent over UGX 4,179.2 billion2 down from the UGX
4,739.1 billion approved for FY 2022/23 (Wasswa, J. H., Oundo, H., Oteba, M. O 04, 2023)The
cuts in the health budget have affected a number of critical sectors of health insurance mostly the
government underwritten ones. Despite all that government has come up with a number of
factors to increase a number of people under taking health insurance.
Over the last 20 years, the private health sector in Uganda has grown significantly. Any
meaningful strategy to improve health outcomes in Uganda must look beyond the public sector
and consider the potential of the not-for-profit and the for-profit (commercial) health sector. The
current Government of Uganda understands this, and the private sector is very much a part of
their Vision 2030 plan for growth in all areas, including health insurance sector.
Despite all offers put in by the government and the private sector to improve health insurance
uptake there is still a gap that needs to be covered and this is seen among university students as
many have no health insurance coverage.
This chapter therefore talks about the perception of health insurance uptake among university
students, this focuses on the significance of the topic of study, the background study of the topic
that describes what literature has already been said about the perception of health insurance
uptake among university students, the statement problem was made to ensure that a specific
problem is defined. Objectives were set accordingly and hence creation of the research question
to be answered, In this very chapter the justification of the topic was generated identifying the
gaps that the study intends on solving, and it is in this very chapter were the scope of study and
the limitation were stated to show how the research was conducted, when, where and for what


period and what seemed to be the likely limiting factors of the study. This has helped us to
understand the factors affecting the uptake of health insurance among the students today.
1.2 Background study
According to Lieberthal, R. D. (2016). Health insurance can be thought of mainly as a form of
healthcare finance, the mechanism by which people pay for healthcare. The majority of
healthcare payments come well after the time that services are rendered, and payments come
mainly from third parties. Like any economic service, there is a market for healthcare finance
with a demand side and a supply side. Unlike many services that are purchased on credit,
healthcare is a highly subjective product owing to the subjective nature of health. Health
insurance is also known as medical. (Julia Kagan, August 06, 2023) also defined health
insurance as when a corporation and a customer enter into a contract for health insurance. In
exchange for the payment of a monthly premium, the corporation offers to cover all or part of the
insured person's medical expenses.
The contract, which is typically for a year, outlines the precise costs linked to disease, injury,
pregnancy, or preventative treatment that the insurance will be liable for covering.
Medical or health insurance covers all medical and surgical costs paid by covered members as a
result of their contracting an illness, disease, or suffering an unintentional physical injury during
the insurance period; The health insurance policy can either pay the healthcare provider directly
or reimburse the insured for any out-of-pocket expenses; Health insurance helps one’s mind to be
at ease as a result, it gives access to the top medical centers, encourages a saving culture and
raises welfare, the resources and tools for health and wellness are made available to insured
people and for group policies, it establishes a "Employer of Choice" situation that boosts
employee productivity and reduces absenteeism.
Just like any other developing country Uganda has adopted the use of health insurance and
according to Monitor newspaper April 18, 2023 the health insurance uptake in Uganda has
grown with its users growing to Shs245b in comparison to when it had just started in 1996. A
number of participants have entered in to this game and have ensued the awareness and
importance of health insurance to the people of Uganda.


But however the youth must preferable the university students have they different perception on
the uptake of health insurance.
1.3 Statement of the problem.
Particularly in low- and middle-income nations like Uganda, health insurance is crucial to
providing access to high-quality medical care.(Monitor, May 19, 2023) stated that the uptake of
health insurance in Uganda is only 1% of the 45millon Ugandans which means only about
500,000 Ugandans are having a health insurance. Although the Ugandan government has taken
steps to increase healthcare access and affordability, there is a dearth of detailed information on
how the university students perceive and use health insurance. The issue at hand centers on
comprehending the variables affecting how university students in Uganda now perceive health
insurance and the obstacles preventing their adoption. Despite the potential advantages of health
insurance, including better access to medical facilities, financial security from unanticipated
medical costs, and enhanced health outcomes, a sizable portion of students lack coverage.
Whereas it is being embraced by some people, insurance uptake in Uganda is generally still low
says; (Bandese Walala 2019). The main reasons for this are economic factors and ignorance of
how insurance works, with the latter forcing some to opt for out-of-pocket payments (Kasemiire,
2018). Individuals incur heavy costs when it comes to medical care and in most cases these costs
are unexpected. Since majority of Ugandans lack health insurance while some do not know what
health insurance is or how it works, this means that in case of illnesses requiring medical
attention they fall into debt in some cases and their lifestyle is greatly affected (Kasemiire,
2018). University Students are among those who should purchase health insurance to protect
themselves from financial damage as over 275,254 students join the universities every year, due
to that fact they have a higher than average chance of developing health issues as a result of a
change in lifestyle from their earlier years. Because of the strain associated with their studies,
they are also susceptible to stress, which might result in various illnesses.Students at universities
have access to a variety of dining options, some of which are unhealthy. Some students also
reside in dormitories away from the campus, some of which are situated in dusty areas and may
cause health issues. Due to all of these dangers, if a student becomes ill without health insurance,
they will be forced to pay out-of-pocket, which can occasionally result in debt. Numerous studies


have concentrated on the uptake of health insurance in general rather than on health insurance
among teenagers specifically. In order to ascertain the circumstances and conditions under which
university students choose to enroll in health insurance, this study will evaluate health insurance
among students.
1.4 Main objective;
Examine the perception and uptake of health insurance among university students.
1.5 Specific objectives
The specific objectives of the study will be to;
To determine the effect of awareness levels among students regarding the health insurance
packages available to them.
To find out the extent to which income affects the uptake of health insurance among students.
To determine how attitude affect the uptake of health insurance
To determine how government policies influence the uptake of private health insurance in
To find out whether students’ gender has an influence on uptake of health insurance
1.6 Research question
What are the information sources that students trust and rely on when making decisions about
health insurance?
How do students perceive the affordability of health insurance plans?
How based can health insurance be made valuable in a university student’s life?
What are the key factors influencing students' perception of the importance of health insurance?


1.7 Justification
The motivation of this study focuses on an urgent need to document the attributable risk of
awareness, affordability, accessibility, and perceived value so us to recognize they impact in the
development of the health insurance sector in Uganda mostly among students. There is currently
a great number of published studies on this study but however the finding of this study therefore
will provide a valuable reference to the health insurance community and body of knowledge as
to if Health insurance knowledge among adolescents is low as far as the perception of health
insurance uptake among students is concerned.
1.8 Scope of study
The main aim of this study is to determine the perception of health insurance uptake among
university students. The study will consider most preferable the BBA students of Uganda
Christian University, excluding non-students. He participants will be interviewed through the use
of questionnaires. A time period of about 10 minutes will be given to each student to create a
more comfortable space for the student in order for the researcher to get their points of view.
However, the assumption is that the student will be open to this since there is nothing to fear and
they are not under any kind of pressure.
1.8.1 Geographical Scope
This research seeks to investigate the factors that determine uptake among BBA students of
Uganda Christian University from 3:3 to 2: 1.
1.8.2 Time Scope
The study is limited and will only be carried out within Uganda Christian University Our
geographical scope shall be Uganda Christian University, located Mukono for a period of 2
weeks.


1.8.3 Population Scope
The research shall seek to study BBA students at Uganda Christian University, one of the largest
private institution of higher education in Uganda. The study shall mainly target undergraduate
students studying at the university.
1.9 Limitation
Due to the nature of the research questions, when carrying out the research, the following factors
will hinder data collection: the students may limit the generation of data, resulting in inadequate
results since there is historical data pertaining to material specifications. Using questionnaires
may make it possible to reach a larger number of students, but they may lack the ability to
provide detailed context or explanations for respondents' answers. This can make it challenging
to interpret their responses accurately or fully understand the underlying reasons behind their
answers.
1.10 Conceptual model; (Gichuru, K. S., Muturi, W., & Wawire, N. 2015, Pg20).









1.10.1 Explanations of the conceptual model
The conceptual model consists of three main components: Awareness Levels, Barriers to
Uptake, and Perceived Value. These components interact to shape the perception of health
insurance among university students.
Awareness levels
Attitude
Gender
Income levels
Uptake of health insurance


Awareness Levels: This component focuses on assessing the awareness levels among students
regarding health insurance options available to them. It includes variables such as knowledge
about different types of health insurance plans, understanding of coverage benefits, familiarity
with insurance providers, and awareness of the enrollment process. The objective is to determine
how informed students are about health insurance options.
Cost: The cost factor refers to the financial implications of obtaining insurance. This includes
the premium amount that students need to pay to be covered by an insurance plan. The
relationship between cost and insurance uptake can be both direct and inverse. As the cost of
insurance increases, the likelihood of insurance uptake may decrease. Higher insurance
premiums might deter financially constrained students from obtaining insurance coverage.
Conversely, if insurance plans are offered at a more affordable rate or with subsidies, the
likelihood of students opting for insurance may increase. Lowering the financial barrier makes
insurance more accessible and attractive.
Attitudes: Attitudes refer to the beliefs, opinions, and perceptions that individuals have towards
insurance. Positive attitudes can encourage insurance uptake, while negative attitudes can
discourage it. If students perceive insurance as a valuable protection against unexpected medical
expenses or other risks, they are more likely to enroll. Positive attitudes can arise from awareness
campaigns, understanding the benefits of insurance, and personal experiences of needing
coverage. Negative perceptions, such as thinking insurance is unnecessary, confusing, or a waste
of money, might lead to lower uptake. Misinformation or lack of education about insurance
could contribute to negative attitudes.
Gender: Gender plays a role in shaping individuals' behaviors and decisions, including
insurance. Depending on cultural norms, societal expectations, and personal experiences, gender
could impact insurance uptake. For example, if one gender is generally more risk-averse or more
health-conscious, it might influence their likelihood of obtaining insurance. In some cases,
gender might not directly influence insurance uptake. Students of all genders could make
decisions based on factors other than their gender.




CHAPTER TWO
LITERATURE REVIEW
2.1 Introduction
This chapter contains the overview of health insurance, the explanations of the effect of the
different independent variables on the outcome variable and the gap in research. In order for me
as the researcher to address the research problem, understanding of the theoretical dynamics of
health insurance uptake among students was necessary. This chapter gives the theoretical review
and literature related to the respective objective in my study.
First, health insurance uptake is defined in this chapter and its antecedents and constructs are
explored, after which perception and the nature and essence of perception and its link to health
insurance uptake are assessed.
2.2 Overview Health Insurance
The main purpose of insurance is to mitigate risk, i.e., to transfer risk from one party, the
insured, to the insurer; this does not mean that the loss is prevented from happening, but it does
give the insured some measure of financial security and peace of mind; the major financial risk
that an individual may face, such as getting into an accident and needing surgery, is transferred
to the health insurer and replaced by a smaller known financial risk, such as the cost of the
surgery; and the replacement risk is paid for by the money.
Getting health insurance is a crucial responsibility for adolescents making the transition to early
adulthood (Charlene A. Wong et al., 2015). Health insurance is a sort of insurance that spreads
the risk of a person needing medical expenses among a large number of people. It may cover all
or part of the risk. It includes coverage for losses resulting from mishaps, medical bills,
disabilities, or unintentional death and limb loss. A health insurance policy is a legal agreement
between a person and an insurance company. The individual can be an employer or a local
group, and the insurance provider can be the government or an insurance firm. In the case of
private contracts, the term may be renewed annually, monthly, or even indefinitely.



2.3 Theoretical framework
Theoretical frameworks provide a basis for understanding the factors that may influence
students' perception and uptake of health insurance.
2.3.1 Health Belief Model (HBM)
The Health Belief Model suggests that an individual's perception and decision to adopt healthrelated behaviors, such as obtaining health insurance, are influenced by their beliefs about
susceptibility to health risks, the severity of those risks, the benefits of taking action, and the
barriers to adopting the behavior. In the context of health insurance uptake among students, this
framework could explore how students perceive their susceptibility to health issues, their
perceived severity, the perceived benefits of having insurance, and the barriers they face in
obtaining coverage.
2.3.2 Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB)
The Theory of Planned Behavior posits that people's intentions and behaviors are determined by
three main factors: attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control. Attitudes refer
to an individual's positive or negative evaluation of a behavior (e.g., getting health insurance).
Subjective norms involve the influence of social pressure and the perception of what others think
about the behavior. Perceived behavioral control relates to an individual's belief in their ability to
perform the behavior. Applying this framework to the perception of health insurance uptake
among students would involve examining students' attitudes towards insurance, the influence of
their social environment, and their perceived control over obtaining coverage.
2.3.3 Social Cognitive Theory (SCT)
Social Cognitive Theory emphasizes the interaction between personal factors, environmental
factors, and behaviors. It suggests that individuals' behaviors are influenced by their self-efficacy
(belief in their ability to perform the behavior), observational learning (learning from others'


experiences), and outcome expectations (anticipated consequences of the behavior). When
applied to the perception of health insurance uptake among students, this framework would
consider how students' self-efficacy, observations of others obtaining insurance, and expectations
regarding the benefits and costs of insurance influence their decision-making.
2.3.4 Diffusion of Innovations Theory
The Diffusion of Innovations Theory explores the process through which new ideas, products, or
behaviors spread among individuals and groups. It suggests that the adoption of an innovation (in
this case, health insurance uptake) is influenced by the characteristics of the innovation itself, the
communication channels through which information is spread, the social system within which
individuals interact, and the individual's readiness to adopt the innovation. Applying this
framework to health insurance uptake among students would involve examining how
characteristics of insurance plans, communication strategies, social networks, and individual
readiness influence students' perception and decision to obtain coverage.
2.4 Gap in Literature
Young adult’s viewpoints on health insurance are crucial. Their preferences for health insurance
can help improve engagement and expand coverage in this community (Charlene A. Wong et al.,
2015). The uptake of health insurance among adolescents in particular deserves special attention,
even though earlier research offers useful data on the topic generally. Investigating the situations
and conditions under which university students get health insurance may therefore be helpful in
order to learn about their preferences for health insurance.








CHAPTER THREE
METHODOLOGY
3.1 Introduction
This chapter describes the methodology that will be used in the design of this study. This chapter
addresses issues concerned with the research design, the study population, the sampling method
and the data collection that will be used as well as the data analysis method.
3.2 Research Design
The study's survey design will be cross-sectional. Data from a population or a representative
subset are observed in cross-sectional research at a certain time. By interviewing a sample of
chosen BBA students at Uganda Christian University Mukono, this study will determine how
health insurance is perceived and used by college students.
3.3 Study Population
All of the students that share the trait we're interested in are included in the study population.
The study's target population is BBA students at Uganda Christian University at the time of the
study. It is believed that the students who will participated in the survey would do so voluntarily.
The students who will take part in the survey will do so voluntarily.
3.4 Population Size.

3.5 Sampling Procedure and Selection
This section covers the target population, sampling frame, sample size estimation, and sampling
strategy.
3.5.1 Data Sources
Primary data is the main source of data that is used in this study. Data is collected from a
selected sample of students studying at Uganda Christian University using a questionnaire.
3.5.2 Sampling Design
In this research, probability sampling is used meaning selection is random. A two-stage sampling
design is used where the population is first divided into strata (subpopulations), namely male and
female, from which simple random sampling (without replacement) is used to achieve the
desired sample of students from each stratum.
3.5.3 Sample Size Determination
To have confidence in the survey results, the sample must be representative of the study
population in terms of selection procedure and number. The total number of students chosen for
the study will be determined by Cochran’s formula (1963). This formula is used for an infinite
population, that is to say, one that is too large or unknown. The formula is shown below:
n – Total sample size selected
z – The standard z-statistic of the normal distribution
p – Degree of variability
q – (1-p)
e – Margin error
We shall set p=0.5 implying q=0.5
The following values were also assumed:


z = 1.96 (at 5% level of significance)
e = 0.1
Substituting these values into the equation above;
3.6 Data Collection Methods
Self-administered questionnaires will be handed out to the respondents by the researcher. The
questionnaires will comprise both closed-ended and open-ended questions aimed at collecting
information from the respondents on the different factors affecting their uptake of health
insurance. The questionnaire is first piloted by asking a few students to read through it and see if
there are any ambiguities which the researcher may not have included.
3.6.1 Data Collection Instrument
The researcher will use a questionnaire to collect. The quantitative questionnaire used will
consist of 17 questions in total. There will be one open ended question, which is question 2
asking for the respondent’s age. The rest of the questions will be closed ended, most of which are
Yes/No type of questions.
3.6.2 Reliability and Validity
Reliability was ensured by paying more emphasis on the BBA 3:2 who are expected to have
more reliable information. The validity of the data was ensured by collecting primary data
through the use of questionnaires.
3.6.3 Data Collection Procedure
The researcher requested for an introductory letter from Uganda Christian University, which
letter was presented to the different class coordinator. The researcher went on to explain what the
research is all about, why the research population was chosen and the benefit of the case study.
Following, the researcher sought permission to request participate fill in questionnaires, putting
into consideration a high level of confidentiality.


3.7 Data Analysis
The data from the questionnaires was first analyzed by the researcher for any detectable errors.
This helped in ensuring consistency of responses, uniformity and accuracy of the data collected.
The data was then entered into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet for editing and coding after which
it was exported and analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Univariate analysis was
carried out which included frequency analysis of each variable.
3.8 Ethical Consideration
Ethical considerations were taken into consideration by first; requesting for an introductory letter
from UCU and then Questionnaires were structured. The respondents were given clear
explanations on the objectives and details of the study as well as its benefits. Those who agreed
to take part in the study were assured of confidentiality with regard to any information they
provide. The respondents’ identities remained anonymous and undisclosed at every point in the
study. The researcher also made them aware that they were allowed to refuse to take part in the
survey in case they felt uncomfortable taking part. This research was self-sponsored and there
was no form of compensation for participants of the research. This ensured that the responses
from the participants were not biased on account of hope for remuneration.

CHAPTER FOUR
4.1 Introduction
This chapter presents the results obtained from the Univariate analysis and interpretation of data
collected from the study, based on the research questions guiding the study.
4.2 Univariate Analysis
The study targeted university students to get their responses on factors affecting uptake of health
insurance. This section analyses the information collected from the respondents.
4.3 Demographic characteristics of respondents
This section presents respondents’ general background information. The components include the
response level, gender, attitude, income levels, and awareness levels.
Response Level.
The response rate shows the percentage of the target population that responded to the study
against the percentage of those that did not respond this presents the response level of the
students to the study. Out of the target population of 403 only 150.
Nature of response

Gender
The questionnaire had a section for respondents to indicate their gender and out of the 403
population target only 105 respond, 63.33% where female and 36.66 were male. This means that
the respondents of this study were unfairly represented.




The graph below illustrates the gender response in percentage.

Number of students with health insurance.
In the questionnaires a section for respondents to include with they have health insurance was
included. Below are the results from the response of the students, only 20% have health while
80% 0f the students don’t have which shows that may of the students don not understand the
importance and impact of health insurance.

From the pie chart above we see that only 23.5% of the respondents of this case study have
health insurance, in the questionnaire a section of where respondents were required to state they
reason for getting health insurance was provided and those were some of their reasons,
• Some stated that they have insurance through their parents’ support and employment
allowance/ benefits which was not by their choice but by the choice of their parent.
• Some stated that they were gifted by family so had to take it up.
• While as others stated that it is time saving when it comes to seeing a doctor.
The remaining 76.5% do not health insurance which clearly states the students’ perception of
health insurance uptake. In the questionnaire a section for respondents to state their reason for
not taking up a health insurance was provided and they were as follows.
• Some stated it is expensive and difficult to maintain as it is paid from time to time and
requires renewing.

• Some stated that the chance of using up your insurance money is less.
• Some people were even questioning how truly effective health insurance is.
• Those with medical health histories stated that I was even more difficult for them to get
the insurance compared to any other person which has forced them to give up on getting
health insurance policy.
• Some said that there are not clear process to insurance.
• Some also stated that health insurance is associated with fraud and calming for the
insurance takes a long process.
Do you know any of your friends with health insurance?
60% of the respondents know a friend or any one with health insurance while 40% do not know
anyone which indicates that majority of the respondents have an idea and an understanding of
what health insurance is. They have a source of information while the 40% may have a very
limited source of information.

Do you know any companies or financial institutions that offer health insurance?
In the questionnaire the section of where respondents were asked about their knowledge of any
insurance company and financial institutions was asked and 81.2% responded yes to knowing
and only 18.80% responded to no, not knowing. This clear showed that majority of the
respondents have knowledge of on what insurance really is.

Do you think that health insurance is necessary to you?
Because the questionnaire had a section that required respondents to respond to weather health
insurance is necessary, majority of them(88.20%) agreed that it was necessary and this fully
supports some of the points they gave as reason as to why one may need health insurance. Only
(18.80%) disagreed which may require that more information about health insurance be made
known to the public. And this disagreement may also show lack of interest among the few
students because the range of those that know and those that don’t is a big gap difference.

4.4 General findings.
From the above results, it is clear that most of the variables are independent. This means that
these independent variables do not explain the variation in the dependent variable thus making
them insignificant.
However, parent/guardian having health insurance has a higher effect on the uptake of health
insurance by university student meaning there is a statistically significant relationship between a
parent having health insurance and the student having health insurance. As seen above, it is
noted that some of the independent variables did not return results. This may be because the
respondents may who do not know anyone with health insurance are among those who do not
have health insurance. This means that basing on the results obtained, it may not be possible to
have health insurance and not know anyone with health insurance. Likewise, those students who
do not know any companies or financial institutions offering health insurance may be part of
those students who do not have health insurance. This also means that basing on the results
obtained, a student cannot have health insurance and not know any companies or financial
institutions that offer health insurance.

CHAPTER FIVE
SUMMARY OF FINDINGS, CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS.
5.1 Introduction
This chapter provides the summary of the findings from the previous chapter, the conclusions
made from these findings and the researcher’s recommendations.
5.2 Summary of Findings.
Of the 150 respondents who took part in the survey, majority of them did not have health
insurance 80%. Only 20% of the respondents had health insurance. Nonetheless, a large
proportion of the respondents 88.2% felt that health insurance is necessary. Only 11.8%% of the
respondents felt that health insurance is not necessary. While the respondents 64.7% agreed that
health insurance should be made mandatory for university students during admission and 55.3%
of the respondents felt that health insurance should not be made mandatory for university
students during admission.
5.3 Conclusions
According to the research findings obtained, it is concluded that a parent/guardian having health
insurance is the only variable with a significant effect on the student taking up health insurance,
after obtaining a percentage of 82.4% which is less than 17. 6%. An odds ratio of 13.75 was
obtained in the multivariate analysis. This implies that a university student who has a
parent/guardian who has health insurance will be 13.75 times more likely to have health
insurance than a university student who has a parent/guardian who does not have health
According to the results obtained, the following hypotheses were supported:
• Students’ gender has no effect on uptake of health insurance.
• Students’ residence has no influence on uptake of health insurance.
• A history of a serious health problem in the family has no effect on uptake of health


• A student opting for out-of-pocket payments before has no influence on uptake of health
• According to the results obtained, the following hypothesis was not supported:
• A parent/guardian having health insurance has no influence on the student’s uptake of
health insurance.
5.4 Recommendations
From the observations made in this study, it can be seen that majority of the students do not have
health insurance. Even though most of the students do not have health insurance, majority of
them agree that health insurance is necessary and also majority of the students agree that health
insurance should be made mandatory for university students during admission to the university.
Most of the students who have health insurance do so because their parents also have health
insurance. Most of the students who do not have health insurance cited financial reasons as the
main barrier to them acquiring the insurance. Another major reason for lack of health insurance
was ignorance about how insurance works. Others did not know where to access health insurance
from. There is growing need to improve and increase sensitization among students about health
insurance and all related benefits. University students are vulnerable to different illnesses and are
exposed to a number of health risks so health insurance should be given high priority. The
findings of this study have given more insight into health insurance among university students.
The researcher recommends increased sensitization among parents with adolescent children
about health insurance and all related benefits. This is important since the findings from the
investigation show that a student is more likely to have health insurance if the student’s
parent/guardian has health insurance too. This implies increasing sensitization among the parents
will in turn increase the chances of the students having health insurance.
5.5 Limitations to the study.
Some respondents are lazy readers and found it hard to go through the whole questionnaire. This
challenge was solved by reading and interpreting the instructions and questions for the
respondents. There was a low level of response rate due to the busy schedules of many of the
students and lack of interest of some of them. There was also a bias attitude in self-reported
answers and difficulty in accurate and honest response. It was also challenging to come up with a
well-structured questionnaire that contains all the desired information while minimizing the
respondent’s fatigue.
