ABSTRACT
Worldwide flexible pavements are mainly constructed with aggregates,
bitumen and filler. This study aims to assess the use of Calcined quarzite
dust (CQD) to enhance rut resistance in the asphalt concrete. The methods
used were mechanical,physical, chemical to determine the engineering
properties of aggregate, bitumen and filler used in this study; also Marshall
test was conducted, as well as the Indirect tensile Strength (ITS) in relation
with the Wheel Tracking Tests (WTT) to assess the performance on the
asphalt mixture. Various tests were done during the study, various factors
such as stability, flow, air voids,voids filled with binder (VFB), and voids in
the mineral aggregate (VMA) were evaluated. The study was conducted with
CDQ percentage variation of 2%, 4% and 6% and 4.4% optimum bitumen
content was obtained from the neat asphalt.
The results of the study showed that the use of Calcined quarzite dust led
to an increase in Marshall stability from 15kN to 21.1 kN, increased Indirect
Tensile Strength Strength ratio from 82% to 88%, ITS dry from 900.2kPa to
1,130.6kPa and ITS wet from 740kPa to 990kPa. With relation to wheel
tracking tests the ITS value greater than 800kPa expect less than 10mm
rutting depth for a 20,000 cycles passes. This study therefore shows that
asphalt mixes with 4.5% CQD in the asphalt mixture can be used as a means
to enhance the stability and stiffness.

CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION
1.1 BACKGROUND
As the traffic in the country increases, the demands for major improvement in
road construction and infrastructure because of the increasing findings. Road
pavements
are
divided
into
two
categories
in
the
world
of
highway
engineering: flexible pavements and rigid pavements. The use of Portland
cement is for making rigid pavements, while bitumen and aggregates are used
to create flexible pavements. A mixture of bitumen, aggregates, mineral
fillers, and additives forms asphalt concrete. Because of its flexibility and
capacity to function in various applications, asphalt concrete is frequently
used in road pavement construction (Asphalt Institute, 2021).
Asphalt concrete is prepared in three known methods, including Hot Mix
Asphalt (HMA), Warm Mix Asphalt, and Cold Mix Asphalt, with the choice often
influenced by geographical and climatic factors. For instance, HMA is the most
used, providing a safe, durable, and comfortable surface for road users.
Flexible pavement roads are primary constructed in Uganda due to their
ability
to
deform
and
move
slightly
under
heavy
traffic
loads
and
environmental changes. However, flexible pavements with asphalt concrete
can experience several types of challenges such as rutting, cracking, shoving,
thermal fatigue, distresses or failure over time.
Pavement is a conglomeration of materials. These materials, their associated
properties, and their interactions determine the strength of the pavement,
therefore their properties should meet the specifications. Material properties
such as aggregate gradation, binder grade, binder content, and air void
content are mainly concerned. Specifics of loading include tire pressure,
contact area, load magnitude, and surrounding factors like temperature. To
achieve the desired pavement performance, these parameters must be

properly incorporated into the design of the asphalt mixture (Pavement
Interactive, 2021).
A few years after the reconstruction of the Kampala - Jinja road in
Bweyogerere at chainage 5+820, rutting reoccurred, which can result in higher
maintenance
costs
and
financial
strains.
Because
maintenance
and
reconstruction before its design life becomes expensive, these crises can have
a major effect on a country's economy (IMF, 2024).
Several research have been focused on assessing the performance of the
flexible pavement by replacing or partially replacing its mixtures to overcome
these problems. To enhance the qualities of bitumen and aggregates, a
variety of fillers such as granite powder, limestone powder, Ordinary Portland
Cement, and numerous agricultural byproducts like Rice Husk Ash and Coconut
Shell Ash, have been explored (Zhang et al., 2020). Furthermore, adding
plastic elements like polyvinyl chloride and low-density polyethylene has
shown improving the mechanistic properties of asphalt mixtures. Particularly,
calcined quartzite dust has been recognized for its capacity for enhancing
overall durability, improve heat resistance, and improve moisture resistance
(Smith et al., 2021).
The purpose of this study is to evaluate how calcined quartzite dust can
increase flexible pavement’s resistance to rutting.

1.2 PROBLEM STATEMENT
Rutting is one of the common problems with flexible pavements, especially in
area with slow traffic flow, such climbing lanes and intersections (Chilukwa,
2019). This happens when the bituminous binder softens as a result of the
pavement's high temperature, making it less able to withstand the shear stress
from the traffic load.
Rutting is the results from rapid shear displacement
along the wheel path, this caused
by a various factors, such as poor mix
design with avoid less than 3% of air voids reducing contact surface area,
inadequate compaction and large axle loads in high traffic volumes; rutting is
also caused by incompatibility or use of expired filler material case of
hydrated lime.
For
instance,
rutting
was
observed
along
Kampala-Jinja
highway
in
Bweyogerere at chainage 5+820. (Kyamuwendo, 2021). Despite that in 2022
the reconstruction of the road by Energo Projekt company, early deformation
reoccurred.
The objective of this study is to improve the asphalt properties and its
performance by employing calcined quartzite dust as a filler. This method
attempts to mitigate the pavement's resistance to rutting by improving its
thermal stability and shear deformation from traffic load.
1.3 MAIN OBJECTIVE
To Assess the use of calcined quartzite dust as a filler to enhance rutting
resistance in asphalt concrete.
1.4 SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES
1. To determine the physical and mechanical and chemical properties of
calcined quartzite dust, aggregates and bitumen.
2. To determine the optimum filler and bitumen content mix design of the
asphalt concrete.

3. To determine the performance of asphalt concrete incorporated with
calcined quartzite dust.
1.5 RESEARCH QUESTIONS
1. What
are
the
properties
of
Calcined
Quartzite
dust,
and
aggregates?
2. What is the Optimum Bitumen Content of Asphalt Concrete to achieve the
desired performance?
3. What are the properties of Asphalt Concrete incorporated with Calcined
Quartzite dust compared to asphalt concrete without calcined quartzite dust.
1.6 JUSTIFICATION
Calcined Quartzite dust (CQD) is a by-product generated from the processing
of the quartzite rock dust, consisting mainly of silica content with about 85-
95% of Silicon dioxide (SiO2) content and other minerals such as Aluminum
oxide (Al2O3) 2-5%, Iron oxide (Fe2O3) 1-3% and Calcium oxide (Sun, Y., Zhao,
Y., Qiu, J. et al. 2022). research have demonstrated that silica content in the
aspahalt
concrete
can
improves
and
aggregate
adhesion,
this
increases rutting resistance and fatigue cracks in the pavement by lowering
the asphalt binder's temperature weakness.
Furthermore, due to its larger specific surface area, CQD filler improve the
interaction of aggregate particles and asphalt binder. These properties are
vital for the pavement's overall performance and longevity since they improve
the load distribution and decreased deformation under traffic loads (Smith et
al. 2021).
Furthermore, calcined quartzite dust’s thermal stability makes it a better
alternative to conventional fillers because it tolerates rising of temperatures
without compromising the integrity of the pavement; which is useful in areas

or
regions
with
significant
temperature
fluctuations
where
pavement
performance is essential (Johnson and Lee, 2019). Therefore, the exploration
of CQD as a filler in asphalt concrete mixtures presents a promising future for
enhancing the performance and sustainability of flexible pavements.
1.7 GEOGRAPHICAL SCOPE OF STUDY
The area of study is in Bweyogerere chainage 5+820, reference marked on the
road along the Kampala - jinja highway.

CHAPTER TWO: LITERATURE REVIEW
2.1 Introduction
Roads provide various services for moving people and goods from one place to
another. Road pavement is that mixture of aggregate, binder ( bitumen or
cement), and filler to make concrete which is laid on the road surface. In
Highway Engineering, there are two types of road pavements commonly
recognized; flexible pavements and rigid pavements.
Flexible pavements are constructed with bitumious materials like asphalt
concrete. Portland Cement Concrete is used in rigid pavement making . In
Uganda most roads are surfaced using flexible pavement.
2.2 Types of Road Pavements
a) Rigid Pavement
These pavements are made of Portland Cement Concrete, Compared to
flexible pavement rigid pavements rely on their sufficient flexural strength to
transfer the wheel load, functions as stiff slab (Papagiannakis and Masad,
2024). They are placed either directly on the prepared sub-grade or on a
single layer of granular or stabilized material. Since there is only one layer of
material between the concrete and the sub-grade, this layer can be called as
base or sub-base course (Tom & Rao, 2007). the rigid pavement is the most
preferred in high traffic regions such as major highways, due to their
durability and resistance to deformation (Mallick and Tahar El-Korchi, 2008).
b) Flexible Pavement
These pavements are rather flexible in their structural action under loading.
Consist of asphalt concrete, flexible pavements
are composed of layered
systems, including surface, base and subbase layer. The flexible pavements
are the most constructed type of road in the word (Qiao, Y., Dawson,et all,

2020),due to their ability to varying subgrade conditions, and throughout
theirs service life, they are design to withstand high traffic loads, changing
environmental conditions and deteriorate.
2.3 TYPES OF ASPHALT CONCRETE
1. Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA)
This type of mix is composed of aggregate and a viscous binding agent, and is
produced at a temperature range of about 149 - 177°C.
There are typically
three subcategories of HMA: Dense-graded mixes, stone matrix asphalt, and
open-grade mixes. Dense-graded mixes are often used in high traffic road due
to their durability. This mix contains more asphalt cement, while also adding
binders and fibers to the mix (Wolf, Sean. 2014).
2. Warm Mix Asphalt (WMA)
This mix is produced at a temperature range from 10-38°C less than a batch of
HMA. There are multiple WMA technologies used in the United States, which
include foaming effect, organic additive, and chemical package. The foaming
effect
is
used
to
increase
workability.
Water
is
added
to
lower
the
temperature and causes the volume of the asphalt binder to expand, which
results in the foam. The organic additive improves the flow by reducing the
asphalt viscosity and is used to avoid permanent deformation (Wolf, Sean.
2014).
3. Cold Mix Asphalt (CMA)
It is generally a blend mix with emulsified or cutback asphalt. Emulsified
asphalts may be anionic or cationic, available in MS or SS grades. The
aggregate component can rage from a dense-graded crushed aggregate to a
granular soil having a relatively high percentage of dust.

2.4 Types of failure in the flexible asphalt
The the primary issues with flexible pavement failures include:
Fatigue cracking: results from horizontal tensile strain at the pavement
bottom.
Rutting: is the indicator of permanent deformation or rut depth along wheel
load path.
Thermal cracking: includes both low-temperature cracking and thermal
fatigue cracking.
2.5 Components of Flexible Pavement
Typically, flexible pavement includes a seal coat, surface course, tack coat,
binder course, prime coat, base course, sub-base course, compacted subgrade, and natural Subgrade (Aalim M, 2020).
Seal Coat: is a thin surface treatment used to water-proof the surface and to
provide skid resistance to a pavement.
Prime coat: is an application of viscous cutback bitumen to an absorbent
surface like granular bases on which the asphalt concrete layer is placed. It
provides bonding between two layers. prime coat penetrates into the layer
below the treated layer, filling the voids, and water-proof surface.
Surface course: is the directly layer in contact with traffic loads, they are
usually constructed with dense graded asphalt concrete(AC). It provides
friction, smoothness, safe driving surface to the users, etc. Also it will prevent
water infiltration into the underlying layers. It must be tough to resist the
distortion under traffic and provide a smooth and skid resistant riding surface,
and must be waterproof to protect the entire base and subgrade from the
weakening effect of water (Nouman, M., Maqbool, Z., Ali, S., & Saleem, A.
2021).

Binder course: is a layer below surface course, helps to distribute load to the
base course.
Base course:
is the road layer of material immediately below the binder
course and it provides additional load distribution and contributes to the subsurface drainage It may be composed of crushed stone, crushed slag, treated
and untreated or stabilized materials.
SubBase: This is the layer below the base course, it provides structural
support, improve drainage, and reduce the intrusion of fines from the subgrade.
Subgrade: this is a layer below subbase consist of natural soil prepared and
compacted to stand the stresses from the layers above. It is essential that the
soil sub-grade is not over stressed. The compaction is done to the desirable
density, near the optimum moisture content.
2.6 Process of flexible pavement design
1. Estimating design traffic loading
The design life is the period during which the road is expected to carry traffic
at a satisfactory level of service, without requiring major rehabilitation or
repair work. It is implicit, however, that certain maintenance work will be
carried out throughout this period in order to meet the expected design life.
This process involves: Design traffic loading, design traffic class, probability
distribution of traffic, axle and wheel load distribution (MoWT, 2010).
1. Determining subgrade strength
The subgrade strength is the other most important factor, apart from traffic
loading, which governs the pavement structural configuration. It is assumed in
this guide that the first stages of determining nominally uniform sections in
terms of subgrade condition will have been undertaken. This can be based on
geological and soil property assessments,
the subgrade of the soil can be

assessed by insitu test of Dynamic Cone Penetrometer (DCP) test or laboratory
testing for CBR. The DCP testing accordance to the BS 1377 : Part 4 : 1990 to
determine the Califoria Bearing Ration (CBR) of the soil. Therefore
helps to
determine the subgrade class (MoWT, 2010).

2.7 Construction Materials used in the Surfacing Layer
The surfacing layer comprises of two different layers, which are the wearing
course and binder course having different gradation characteristics and
thicknesses respectively. They are constructed with Asphalt Concrete.
Asphalt concrete (AC) is a heterogeneous material that consists of bitumen
(binder), natural or artificial aggregate, mineral filler, additives and air voids.
Asphalt concrete is widely used as a pavement construction material (Hunter,
2014).
2.7.1. Bitumen
The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) defines bitumen as a
generic class of amorphous, dark colored, cementitious substances, natural or
manufactured, composed principally of high molecular mass hydrocarbons,
soluble in carbon di-sulphide (ASTM D8-83, 1984).

The bitumen is derived from two sources from petroleum crude oil and the
second
category
from
the
natural
asphalt
deposits
(Bag).
is
characterized by:
1. Penetration of Bituminous Materials
Test references: ASTM D 5-86.
The penetration test is used to measure consistency of bituminous materials
expressed as the distance in tenths of a millimeter that a standard needle
vertically penetrates a sample of the material under known conditions of
loading, loading time and temperature (ASTM,2019).
Table 2 Penetration variation (ASTM,2019).
2. Softening Point Test
Test references: ASTM D 36-70
The softening point test is used to measure and specify the temperature
at which bituminous binders begin to show fluidity. The softening point is
also helps in evaluating the uniformity of shipments and sources of supply.
The softening point is also an indicative of the tendency of the material to
flow at elevated temperatures encountered in service (ASTM,2019).

2.7.2 Aggregate
Aggregates are granular materials such as, gravel and crushed stone that are
used in construction to produce concrete or for flexible pavement mixture.we
have many types of aggregate such as grinite, marble, etc.
For the flexible pavement mixture the selection of aggregate plays a key role
in its performance, specific tests such as Aggregate Crushing Value (ACV),
Aggregate Impact Value (AIV), Ten Percent Fines Value (TFV), Soundness,
Flakiness
Index
are
required,
following
the
required
standards
and
specifications according to the (MoWT 2010). in Uganda.
1. Aggregate Crushing Value (ACV)
Test reference: BS 812: Part 110: 1990
ACV is a measure of the resistance of an aggregate to crushing under gradually
applied compressive load (CML, 2000).

Objective
To measure the resistance of aggregates to crushing under a gradually applied
load. Weak aggregates could potentially compromise the integrity of the
pavement structure.
2. Aggregate Impact Value (AIV)
Test reference: BS812: Part 112: 1990.
Aggregate Impact Value is a measure of the resistance of an aggregate to
sudden sock or impact. It is used in the construction and civil engineering
industry to assess the quality and suitability of aggregates for use in road
construction and other structural applications (CML, 2000).
Objective
To measure the resistance of aggregates to a sudden impact or shock. This is
crucial for aggregates used in road construction as they are constantly
subjected to impacts from moving vehicles.
3. Ten Percent Fine Value (TFV)
Test reference: BS 812: Part 111: 1990.
To
measure
the
resistance
of
aggregates
against
a
gradually
applied
compressive load. This test provides a measure of the strength of the
aggregate and is particularly useful for evaluating the suitability of aggregates
for use in road construction and other structural applications. The TFV was
intended to determine the load necessary to crush a prepared aggregate
sample to yield 10% of material passing a specified sieve after crushing (CML,

4. Flakiness Index
Test reference: BS 812-P105:1-1989
The Flakiness Index of a an aggregate sample is found by separating the flaky
particles and expressing their mass as a percentage of the mass of the sample.
The test is applicable to material passing a 63 mm sieve and retained on a 6.3
mm sieve (CML, 2000).
The Flaky particles were considered undesirable since they could be weak by
nature and break easily under strong loads, especially when used as base
course and in coarse aggregates. When an aggregate's thickness was less than
60% of the average sieve size, it was categorized as flaky.
5. Los angeles abrasion test
Test reference: BS 812: Part 111:1990.
To measure the resistance of aggregates to wearing or abrasion. It can also be
to determine the hardness of the aggregates. It evaluates the toughness and
abrasion resistance of aggregate materials which is crucial for determining
their suitability for use in road in constructions particularly in wearing
surfaces where high resistance to wear and tear is required (CML, 2000).
6. Soundness of Aggregates by use of Sodium Sulphate
Test references: ASTM C 88 - 90
The objective of this test is to provide a preliminary estimate of the
soundness of aggregates subject to weathering action for use in concrete
and road pavements. The Soundness test by use of Sodium Sulphate
covers the testing of aggregates to estimate their soundness when
subjected to weathering (ASTM,2019).

The following is the standard required for theses tests

2.7.3 FILLER
Fillers are fine materials with particle sizes under 0.075mm. They can come
from natural sources, like crushed rock fines, or be added materials such as
cement, lime, or ground rock. Natural fillers come from crushed rocks, while
manufactured fillers include hydrated lime, cement, ash, or slag. Higher filler
content increases brittleness and the likelihood of cracking during use.
A. Function of Filler
As a result, the asphalt mixture pavement should be resistant to water and
frost, pavement deformations, fatigue cracks and and temperature resistance
so the filler help in the
Filling the voids in the aggregate to create a denser mixture increasing in the
resistance and durability,also facilitate asphalt binder to interact with
aggregates and the stability of the mixture.

B. Chemical testing of filler material
B.1 X-Ray Fluorescence
Test reference: ASTM E1621-22
This method is suitable for providing data on the chemical composition of
filler
material.
It
is
intended
for
routine
production
control
and
for
determination of chemical composition for the purpose of certifying material
specification compliance (ASTM,2019). The method aimed to determine the
chemical composition of the Lime Kiln Dust mineral filler.
B.2 sieve analysis
Test reference: ASTM D546-1
The method is used to determine compliance of mineral fillers with the
grading requirements of Specification D242 (ASTM,2019).
2.7.4 Marshall Test
References: ASTM D 1559-89
The Marshall test is use to evaluate the physical properties of asphalt
specimens related to plastic deformation properties of asphalt mixes.
Main principles
The Marshall test is used with bitumen or bitumen cutback where the
maximum aggregate size is 25.4 mm or less. Asphalt specimens are
loaded on their cylindrical side-edges with a Marshall loading head at
specified loading rate and temperature. The resistance against plastic
flow is measured (CML, 2000).

2.7.6 Indirect Tensile Strength Test
Test references: ASTM D3967
The test procedure is used to determine the indirect tensile strength and
E- modulus of asphalt concrete. The results can be used to evaluate the
relative quality/strength of materials as well as in pavement design,
evaluation and analysis.
Required equipment
Testing machine, typically Marshall type test apparatus (loading speed
of 2” / minute), an indirect tensile stress loading frame, water bath
accurate to 1.0 °C
In the middle of each plate is a loading strip. These should be at least be
of the same length as the test specimen height. The width of the loading
strips should be 12.7 mm, with the same curvature as the test specimen.

CHAPTER THREE: METHODOLOGY
3.1 INTRODUCTION
This chapter details the different experiments and techniques that were
carried out while tackling the different objectives of this study that is to say
chemical composition of CQD, its performance in asphalt concrete and
carrying out a mix design for the optimum percentage usage of CQD filler
material.
It
constitutes
detailed
information
about
sample
collection,
preparation,
mix
design
and
different
tests
that
were
carried
out.
Experimental Research was carried out at stirling Civil engineering Limited
and Makerere Geology department to achieve the desired specific objectives
of this research study.
3.2 Material acquisition and preparation
The Quartzite rock Dust used in this research was obtained from Jomayi
Stones Limited located in Seeta. The Quartzite Rock Dust was then placed in 2
sacks and transported to Stirling Civil Engineering Ltd where it was crushed to
powder using a LAAV machine to obtain smaller sizes passing throught sieve
600 and 300 micrometer. The quartzite rock dust was then taken to Makerere
University Department of Geology and Petrolium studies to be calcined. The
dust was placed in an electric kiln at temperatures ranging between 8000C to
10000C for two hours to obtain CQD. The XFR test was carried on non calcined
and calcined material.
3.2 Testes required
1. Aggregate Crushing Value (ACV)
I.
Main principals
ACV is determined by measuring the material passing a specified
sieve, then crushed under a load of 400 kN. The test is suitable to

fraction aggregates passing a 14 mm sieve and retained on a 10 mm
sieve. The method is not suitable for testing soft aggregates expected
with ACV higher than 30 (CML, 2000).
II.
Test Procedure
The cylinder of the test apparatus is placed in position on the baseplate,place a third of test specimen, each third being compacted by 25
strokes of the tamping rod evenly distributed over the surface of the
layer. The apparatus with the specimen and plunger were placed in
position, between the platens of the compression testing machine.; an
applied force of 400kN at a uniform rate for about 10 min.
Weigh the tray and the aggregate and record the mass of
aggregate used (M1) to the nearest 1 g.
The whole specimen were Sieved on the 2.36 mm sieve until no
further significant amount passes. Weigh and record the masses of the
fraction passing and retained on the sieve to the nearest 1 g (M2 + M3
respectively). If the total mass (M2 + M3) differs from the initial mass
(M1) by more than 10 g, the it requested to discard the result and test a
further specimen.
To calculate the ACV expressed as a percentage to the first decimal
place for each test specimen from the following equation:
���=
��
Where
M1is the mass of the test specimen (in g)
M2 is the mass of the material passing the 2.36 mm sieve (in g)

2. Aggregate Impact Value (AIV)
I.
The test can be performed in either in dry or in a soaked condition. The test is
applicable to a standard fraction aggregates passing a 14 mm sieve and
retained on a 10 mm sieve (CML, 2000).
II.
Test Procedures
Dry condition
Fix the cup of the specimen in position and place the test specimen in
it and compact by 25 strokes of the tamping rod, the sample is place
under the hammer which fall freely on to the aggregate to achieve a
total of 15 blows.
The crushed aggregate were removed and poured on a tray, the
weighing of the tray and the aggregate specimen and record the mass
of aggregate used (Ml) to the nearest 0.1 g.
Sieve the whole specimen in the tray on the 2.36 mm sieve until no
further significant amount passes. Weigh and record the masses of the
fraction passing and retained on the sieve to the nearest 0.1 g (M2 +
M3 respectively). If the total mass (M2 + M3) differs from the initial
mass Ml by more than 1 g, the sample is also discard and requist for
further tests.
Soaked Condition
Same apply as in dry condition, except that the number of blows of the
hammer is the number of blows that yield between 5 % and 20 % fines, and 15
blows were also used.

The crushed specimen is removed from the cup and dry in the oven at a
temperature of 105 ± 5oC for at least 12 hours. Allow the material to cool and
weigh to the nearest 0.1 g and record the mass of the test specimen (Ml), the
the procedure for recording the masses same as applied for dry condition.
To calculate the AIV expressed as a percentage to the first decimal place
for each test specimen from the following equation:
���=
��
Where
Ml is the mass of aggregates or mass of the oven-dried test specimen (in g)
M2 is the mass of aggregates or mass of the oven-dried material passing the
2.36 mm sieve (in g).
3. Ten Percent Fine Value (TFV)
I.
The 10 % Fines Value (TFV) is determined by measuring the load
required to crush a prepared aggregate sample to give 10 % material
passing a specified sieve after crushing usually sieve 14/10mm. The test
is also known as the 10% Fines Aggregate Crushing Test 10 %. The test
can be performed in both a dry condition and in a soaked condition (CML,
The test is applicable to both weak and strong aggregates. The TFV
test resembles the determination of the ACV, which requires a force
equal to 400 kN to be applied on the test sample.

II.
Calculations
To calculate the force F (in kN), to the nearest whole number, required
to produce 10 % fines for each test specimen, from the following
equation:
���= ���
�+ �
Calculate the mean of the two results to the nearest 10 kN for forces of 100 kN
or more, or to the nearest 5 kN for forces less than 100 kN.
4. Flakiness Index (FI)
I.
The Flakiness Index of an aggregate sample is found by separating the
flaky particles and expressing their mass as a percentage of the mass of
the sample. The test is applicable to material passing a 63 mm sieve
and retained on a 6.3 mm sieve (CML, 2000).
II.
Test Procedure
The first step is to carry out a sieve analysis using the sieves given in the CML, it
is required to discard all aggregates retained on the 63 mm sieve and all
aggregate passing the 6.3 mm sieve.
Weigh each of the individual size-fractions retained on the sieves,
and store them in trays with their size marked on the trays, from the
sums of masses of the fractions in the trays (M1), then calculate the
individual percentage retained on each of the various sieves. It is also
required to discard any fraction whose mass is 5 % or less of mass M1
record the mass remaining (M2). Combine and weigh all the particles
passing each of the gauges. (M3)

The value of the Flakiness Index is calculated from the expression:
��=
��
5. Los Angeles Abrasion test value (LAAV)
I.
The Los Angeles test is a measures
the degradation of mineral
aggregates from a combination of actions including abrasion, impact
and grinding in a rotating steel drum containing a specified number of
steel spheres. As the drum rotates, a shelf plate picks up the sample
and the steel spheres, carrying them around until they are dropped to
the opposite side of the drum, creating an impact or crushing effect.
The contents then roll within the drum with an abrading and grinding
action until the shelf plate impacts and the cycle is repeated (CML,
After the prescribed revolution of 500 revolutions, with a speed of 30 to
33 rpm; the contents are removed from the drum and the aggregate is
sieved through 1.70mm sieve to measure the degradation as a percent
loss.
II.
Calculations
Express the loss which is difference between the original mass (m1) and
the final mass (m2) of the test sample as a percentage of the original
mass of the test sample, from the equation:
LAA value =
��−��
��
× 1 0 0 ( % )

6. Soundness of Aggregates by use of Sodium Sulphate
I.
The Soundness test by use Sodium Sulphate to cover the testing of
aggregates
helps
to
estimate
their
soundness
when
subjected
to
weathering. This was done by repeated immersion in saturated solutions
of sodium sulphate followed completely dehydrate the salt precipitated
in permeable pore spaces. This test method provides information helping
in judging the soundness of aggregates when adequate information is not
available from service records of the material exposed to actual
weathering conditions (CML, 2000).
7. Marshall Mix Design
I.
Main priciples
The results from Marshall Mix Design are often used to set up asphalt
mix formulation and specifications (CML, 2000).
The binder content is varied in steps of typically 0.5% around an assumed
optimum binder content, for example it can vary from 2%, 2.5%, 3%,... etc.
The optimum binder content is determined by which best complies with
Marshall stability, flow, void content, voids filled with binder and density
requirements for the mix being investigated (Asphalt Institute, 2015).
The Marshall stability and flow test provides the performance prediction
measure for the Marshall mix design method. The stability portion of the test
measures the maximum load supported by the test specimen at a loading rate
of 50.8 mm/minute. Load is applied to the specimen till failure, and the
maximum load is designated as stability (ASTM,2019). During the loading, an
attached dial gauge measures the specimen’s plastic flow (deformation) due
to the loading. The flow value is recorded in 0.25 mm or 0.01 ̈ increments at

the same time when the maximum load is recorded (Transportation Research
board, 2017).
II.
Test procedures
A. Specimen preparation: Approximately 18,000g of bitumen, aggregates and
filler is heated to a temperature of 175 −190oC but bitumen was heated to a
temperature of 121 −125oC with the first trial percentage of bitumen (from
3% to 5% by weight of the mineral aggregates). The heated aggregates and
bitumen are thoroughly at a temperature for homogeneous mixture. The mix
is placed in a preheated mould and compacted with rammer with 70 blows on
either side at temperature of 138oC to 149oC.
B. Bulk specific gravity of mix (Gm): is the specific gravity while considering
the air voids in the mixture is find by: Gm =
��
��−��
where, Wm is the weight of mix in air, Ww is the weight of mix in water, Note
that Wm −Ww gives the volume of the mix.
C. Air voids percent (Vv): Vv is the percent of air voids by volume in the
specimen and is given by: Vv =
(��−��)×���
��
where Gt is the theoretical specific gravity of the mix, and Gm is the bulk or
actual specific gravity of the mix.
D. Percent volume of bitumen (Vb): is the percent of volume of bitumen to
the total volume and given by: Vb =
��
��
��+��+��+��
��
where, W1 is the weight of coarse aggregate in the total mix, W2 is the weight
of fine aggregate in the total mix, W3 is the weight of filler in the total mix,
Wb is the weight of bitumen in the total mix, Gb is the apparent specific
gravity of bitumen, and Gm is the bulk specific gravity.

E. Voids in mineral aggregate (VMA): is the volume of voids in the aggregates,
and is the sum of air voids and volume of bitumen, and is calculated by
VMA = Vv+Vb
where, Vv is the percent air voids in the mix, and Vb is percent bitumen
content in the mix.
F. Voids filled with bitumen (VFB): is the voids in the mineral aggregate
frame work filled with the bitumen, and is calculated as: VFB =
��×���
���
where, Vb is percent bitumen content in the mix and VMA is the percent voids
in the mineral aggregate.
G. Determine Marshall stability and flow Marshall stability refers to the
maximum load required to produce failure when the specimen is preheated to
a prescribed temperature placed in a special test head and the load is applied
at a constant strain (50mm per minute). While the stability test is in progress
dial gauge is used to measure the vertical deformation of the specimen. The
deformation at the failure point expressed in units mm is called the Marshall
flow value of the specimen (Dr. Tom V. Mathew, 2009).
8. Indirect Tensile Strength Test
I.
Main principles
A load is applied on two diametrically opposite sides. This induces a
tensile stress in the test specimen. The test is performed with a constant
deformation speed until failure occurs,the test is done in dry and wet
condition; the maximum load is recorded and is used to calculate the
indirect tensile strength(CML, 2000).

II.
Results
Maximum load is recorded Newton, for the Calculations the indirect tensile
strength is calculated by equation:
St
=
(���.��× �ax
(�× �)
)
Where:
St
= indirect tensile strength (kPa)
Pmax = maximum load at failure (N)
t = height of the specimen (mm)
D = diameter of the specimen (mm)
And the material’s E-modulus is calculated using the formula:
Emod = 6.1 × S + 100 (MPa)
Additional Calculation
Calculate the specimen’s dry bulk density based on the registered dry mass
and height/diameter measurements (mass/volume).

CHAPTER FOUR: RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
4.1 Introduction
This chapter presents in detail the results obtained from each of the tests
carried out on the materials used for the experimental investigation, including
quality control tests on the materials and the specimen. The results will be in
the graphical representations and analysis showing relationship between the
variables for each test objective carried out.
Also covers discussion on the
materials findings including the material behaviour under each test.
4.2 Chemical Composition of Filler
Various tests were conducted to examine the chemical and physical properties
of Calcined Quartzite Dust.
The chemical properties were determiner from
XREF-Spectrometer analysis. The Department received sample to be analyzed
for Al203, SiO2 and Fe2O. During analysis the sample was ground to fine powder
(< 0.063mm), from which a pressed powder pellet was prepared and scanned
using an XRF spectrometer (Epsilon 1) for Al203, SiO2 and Fe203, determination.
The content is expressed in weight percentages (wt%) as shown in the figure 2 .
Figure 1 Chemical composition of Quartzite dust before calcination.

Figure 2 Chemical composition of Quartzite dust after calcination.
iron Increase: Fe203 rose from 0.57% to 1.1%, due to calcination concentrating
iron by removing volatile components.
Aluminum Decrease: Al20, dropped from 0.15% to 0.1%, due to their change in
structure. And other elements or impurities such as SM203, CaO, and TiO2,
were removed, during the calcination process; these impurities are removed
to ensure the material stability is not compromised as they react with
components such as water in nature.
The chemical composition of the CQD shows about 98.8 % of SiO2, which has
been shown to improve the adhesion and bonding between aggregates and
bitumen in the asphalt as
its increases the rutting
resistance of asphalt
mixture (None V. Udaya Bhanu and Rao, 2016).

4.3 Specific Gravity of the Filler
Table 6 Specific Gravity of Filler
The average value of specific gravity was 2.546 as shown in Table 6 which lies
within the required standard range of 2.4 to 3.0 according to AASHTO T100-
95(1995). This implied that this filler material was suitable to be used in the
study.
