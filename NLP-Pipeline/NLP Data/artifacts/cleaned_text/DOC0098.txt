CHAPTER ONE
INTRODUCTION
1.0 Introduction
This study is about establishing the impact of landslides on socio-economic wellbeing of
households in Nametsi Sub County, Bududa District. This chapter therefore presents; the
background of the study, statement of the problem, purpose of the study, research
objectives, research questions, scope of the study, significance of the study, conceptual
framework and definition of key terms.
1.1 Background to the Study
Worldwide, there were 15 major reported landslides last year, killing 1,480 people, with
Colombia, Nepal, Brazil, Indonesia, Tajikistan and Burundi also among the worstaffected countries. Two landslides were also among the world‘s 10 deadliest disasters in
2015 – on a list topped by April‘s Nepal earthquake – killing 627 people in Guatemala in
October and 256 in Afghanistan in April. Natural disasters are complex detrimental
events that occur entirely beyond the control of humans (Acosta, 2018). Natural disasters
can be classified based on the speed of onset; some disasters occur within seconds
(landslides), minutes (tornadoes) or hours (flash floods and tsunamis) and others may take
months or years to manifest themselves (droughts) and how they influence socioeconomic wellbeing of households. Furthermore, rapid onset disasters such as landslide
shave a massive impact on human life and property.
Landslides are more widespread than any other geological event, and can occur anywhere
in the world. They occur when large masses of soil, rocks or debris move down a slope
due to a natural phenomenon or human activity. Mudslides or debris flows are also a
common type of fast-moving landslides (Acosta, 2018). Landslides can accompany heavy
rains or follow droughts, earthquakes or volcanic eruptions. Areas most vulnerable to
landslides include steep terrain, including areas at the bottom of canyons land previously
burned by wildfires as well as land that has been modified due to human activity, such as
deforestation or construction. Between 1998-2017, landslides affected an estimated 4.8
million people and cause more than 18 000 deaths and economic losses of about
$65billion. Climate change and rising temperatures are expected to trigger more
landslides, especially in mountainous areas with snow and ice. As permafrost melts,
rocky slopes can become more unstable resulting in a landslide. Using the global fatal

landslide database, researchers evaluate the characteristics of landslides induced by
natural and anthropogenic factors with respect to topographic, climatic, and
anthropogenic factors, drawing attention to their persistent spatial pattern.
The majority of natural (69.3%) and anthropogenic (44.1%) landslides occur in
mountainous areas in tropical and temperate regions, which are also characterized by the
highest casualty rates per group, 66.7% and 43.0%, respectively (Acosta, 2018).
However, they significantly differ in terms of their morphometric footprint. Fatal
landslides triggered by natural variables occur mostly in the highest portions of the
topographic profile, where human disturbance is minimal. As for their anthropogenic
counterpart, these failures cluster at much lower altitudes, where slopes are gentler, but
socio-economic wellbeing of households is higher due to a higher population density.
Landslides have had several other costs to countries as well: increased service
expenditures, demands on schools and losses in educational achievements and
productivity. In Chile, lack of landslides cost households $1.5 billion in lost earnings in
2014 more than 2% of the country's GDP. In India, the World Bank survey (2016) found
that landslides contribute to 56% of household poverty. Landslides constitute a single
biggest risk to Australian households, resulting into 67% of reduced livelihoods and
economic losses of $13.7 billion a year. The World Bank is addressing the challenge of
landslides through precautionary means—for instance, by restricting or even removing
populations from areas with a history of landslides, by restricting certain types of land use
where slope stability is in question, and by installing early warning systems based on the
monitoring of ground conditions such as strain in rocks and soils, slope displacement,
and groundwater levels.
Landslides are responsible for considerably greater economic and casualty losses than is
generally recognized; they represent a significant element of many major disasters in
which the magnitude of their effects is overlooked by news media. For example, the
tremendous destruction and loss of life caused by the 1970 Huascaran disaster in Peru,
which killed some 20,000 people, is often referred to in publications that review disasters
as an earthquake disaster, because the landslide was triggered by an earthquake; this is in
spite of the fact that the actual damage, destruction, and casualties were directly caused
by a huge, high-velocity debris avalanche (Bodenlos and Ericksen, 2022).

On the basis of their analysis of landslide loss data for Southern California and
extrapolation of these data to the rest of the nation, Krohn and Slosson (1976) estimated
the annual costs of landslides to private dwellings in the U.S. to be about $400 million in
1971 dollars ($1.2 billion). This estimate did not include indirect costs or costs to public
property, forest or agricultural lands, mines, or transportation or communications
facilities. In 1985 the U.S. National Research Council (Committee on Ground Failure
Hazards, 2020), using these estimates, rough approximations of indirect costs, and
inflationary trends, evaluated annual landslide losses in the U. S. at about $1 billion to $2
billion ($1.6-$3.2 billion). Landslide deaths in the U.S. have been estimated at 25-50
people per year. Obviously these estimated annual losses are averages, which will be
exceeded in some years, but will not be approached in others.
A landslide is defined as the movement of a mass of rock, debris, or earth down a slope.
Landslides are a type of "mass wasting," which denotes any down-slope movement of soil
and rock under the direct influence of gravity. The term "landslide" encompasses five
modes of slope movement: falls, topples, slides, spreads, and flows. These are further
subdivided by the type of geologic material (bedrock, debris, or earth). Debris flows
(commonly referred to as mudflows or mudslides) and rock falls are examples of
common landslide types and can greatly impact socio-economic wellbeing of households
(Acosta, 2022).
Almost every landslide has multiple causes. Slope movement occurs when forces acting
down-slope (mainly due to gravity) exceed the strength of the earth materials that
compose the slope. Causes include factors that increase the effects of down-slope forces
and factors that contribute to low or reduced strength (Bodenlos and Ericksen,
2021). Landslides can be initiated in slopes already on the verge of movement by rainfall,
snowmelt, changes in water level, stream erosion, and changes in ground water,
earthquakes, volcanic activity, disturbance by human activities, or any combination of
these factors. Earthquake shaking and other factors can also induce landslides underwater.
These landslides are called submarine landslides. Submarine landslides sometimes cause
tsunamis that damage coastal areas.
A depressingly high proportion of writing on landslides in Africa both in literature and
elsewhere is based on wishful thinking. The most widespread risk from natural hazards is,
with little doubt, that posed by ground instability; landslides and landslips; mudflows;
rock avalanches and a range of other categories in which large volumes of surface

material are set in motion. They can be triggered by earthquakes, volcanism or heavy
rainfall that changes the physical properties of rock and soil. Not only steep slopes pose a
risk, for some affect ground with quite gentle topography, as witness the terrible scenes
from Sulawesi triggered by the 28 September 2018 magnitude 7.5 earthquakes beneath
the horn of Africa. This set in motion mudflows on gently sloping ground when the
seismic waves caused liquefaction of unconsolidated sediments that not only shattered
dwellings by the lateral motion, but many households sank into the slurry with little trace,
property and livelihoods destroyed, . The rapid events left a death toll confirmed at 2010
people with about 5000 missing, feared to have been swallowed by the earth. In the last 9
months mass movement has resulted in fatalities in many places, the most publicized
being in Uganda, Malawi, Kenya, South Sudan and the list grows as it does every year.
Uganda is known as the ―Pearl of Africa‖ because of its stunning natural beauty and
biodiversity. Its lush vegetation is associated with regular tropical rainfall, but the East
African nation is now struggling to deal with more frequent and intense rains that are
causing landslides. Landslides can dump millions of tons of muddy debris in Uganda‘s
rivers and streams, said Mary Goretti Kitutu, Uganda‘s minister of energy and mineral
development and an expert on geology and landslides. Such debris can dam rivers, flood
surrounding areas, and cause damage to infrastructure.
―The main landslide types [in Uganda] are debris slumps, which occur on concave slopes
where water concentrates. Slopes facing northeast are most prone to landslides, which
coincide with the dominant rainfall direction,‖ Kitutu said. The region‘s soil profile is
significant, she continued, explaining that ―topsoils have a high infiltration rate, which
allows fast flow of water into the deeper, clay-rich horizons promoting water stagnation
and causing slope failure.‖ Although Uganda has always experienced some loss of life
due to landslides, the number of casualties has increased this century. Over the past 25
years, catastrophic landslides have regularly hit the foothills of Mount Elgon, for
instance, which straddles the border between eastern Uganda and Kenya. The
region‘s most devastating landslide swept the slopes in 2010. Although more than 300
people are thought to have perished, only about 100 bodies were recovered. Thousands of
homes were damaged or destroyed.
Ugandan environmental specialist Mary Goretti Kitutu warns that despite traditional
knowledge of how to avoid landslide risk, population pressures mean that people still cut
terraces on slopes, till open land, cut down trees to create farmland and construction

space. Community sensitization, encouraging family planning, relocating people from
risk areas and creating alternative income-generating activities to lessen pressure on land
are crucial to counter this, she argues. In Bududa district, following the adoption of the
15-year Sendai Framework of Disaster Risk Reduction by the international community in
March last year, the Ugandan government has stepped up its drive for risk-informed
development. That includes harnessing the wisdom of residents of Bududa and the other
landslide-prone eastern districts of Manafwa, Bulambuli and Sironko, assigning officials
to document, integrate and promote traditional, indigenous and local knowledge to protect
the people and communities against disasters.
Mr. Martin Owor, Commissioner for Disaster Preparedness and Management at the
Office of the Prime Minister, confirms that despite flooding and landslides during the
2015 El Nino-sparked rains, only three people are on record as having died. That was a
significant drop from the 2007, 2010 and 2012 landslides when in total, over 300 lives
were lost. Mr. Owor attributes this fall in numbers to adequate planning, application of
traditional knowledge and strong partnerships between development partners, media
houses and the local community, despite limited resources. ―Our forefathers used to tell
us about certain insects, birds, clouds and winds which act as early signs of rainy or dry
seasons. People decided to ignore and abandon indigenous knowledge and then depended
only on science. But today, we have come to the realization that indigenous knowledge
works,‖ he says.
However, there has been no comprehensive single author survey on the impact of
landslides on socio-economic wellbeing of households in Nametsi Sub County, Bududa
District. Not that the subject has suffered from any lack of interests but many historical
scholars and publications particularly in Uganda and Africa have often been drawn more
to the international scene than to the potentially more hazardous subject of academic
performance at home. Very few historical nodes have been made on the subject and the
resulting literature has, however, almost exclusively taken the form of edited volumes,
specialized monographs and polemical contributions to debates and this is the gap this
study filled.
1.2 Problem statement
Despite of well-funded government programmes in Nametsi sub-county, socio-economic
well-being of households is still very low. Low levels of socio-economic wellbeing has
had far reaching consequences in terms of reduced productivity and community

empowerment and significantly contributing to down ward socio-economic mobility of
household members including low consumption, investments and saving thresholds and
also affecting relationship Ojangole et al., (2022). Nametsi is one of the poorest and most
mountainous areas in Bududa district. Of the sub-county's37, 687 people, 70% are
economically marginalized and 40% living in poverty (UBOS, 2021, Ministry of Finance,
Planning and Economic Development, 2020).
The public has with great concern observed that landslides impend socio-economic wellbeing of households in Nametsi Sub-County. Despite the interventions in Bududa through
wealth creations programmes such as NAADS, NUSAF, youth livelihood fund and more
recently PDM, socio-economic well-being of households is poor and if nothing is done
there would be a likelihood of high illiteracy, constant morbidity, death and low
economic development, therefore strong and focused strategies are needed to reverse poor
socio-economic well-being of households. Preliminary results further reveal that there is
there is no single comprehensive author survey regarding the impact of landslides on
socio-economic wellbeing of households in Nametsi Sub County, Bududa District leading
to limitations and distortions in literature, a gap this study seeks to address

The above conceptual framework shows the relationship between variables. Landslides
Human activity induced, rainfall induced, mud-flow and rocks and debris. While
dependent variable is Socio-economic wellbeing with parameters of income, housing,
food security, and transportation and trade. The conceptual framework has been drawn on
the assumption that if landslides are prevented, socio-economic wellbeing will improve
and the reverse is undoubtedly true. Nevertheless, this may not be automatic as other
factors may come into play. These may include Landslide prediction, Landslide resistant
structures, increased disaster risk financing and Crating community awareness about
landslides.. These factors have been dully coined as intervening variables by the study
and are being isolated to avoid making wrong conclusions.
1.9 Definition of key terms
a) A landslide is defined as the movement of a mass of rock, debris, or earth down a
slope. Landslides are a type of "mass wasting," which denotes any down-slope
movement of soil and rock under the direct influence of gravity (Davis, 2020)
b) Socio-economic wellbeing: this refers to the way people live ith regards to life
fulfilling requirements (MoGLSD, 2021)













CHAPTER TWO
LITERATURE REVIEW
2.1 Introduction
This chapter shows the various sources of related literature to the topic of the research.
The sources include; review of scholarly journals, government documents, text books,
Internet and Newspapers, it also presents theoretical review, actual review on the effect of
drug abuse on increase in rates of crimes among the youths. This literature review has
been done objective by objective.
2.2 How human activities contributes to landslides
Acosta (2018) found that excavation or cuts increase the slope angle if carried out without
specialist advise. Mining, blasting rock or reclamation of land can also destabilize slopes.
Farming activities on slopes involve removal of vegetation cover usually followed by
terracing. Sometimes, farmers burn down vegetation as a convenient method of clearing
land for cultivation. Commercial logging results in deforestation. These activities increase
surface run-off of rainwater and expose the soil to erosion. Changes in water regime
results in raising or lowering of ground water table. Alteration of surface drainage can
also be a contributory factor.
Bodenlos and Ericksen (2018) argued that irrigation alters natural surface drainage.
Surface run-off of irrigated water on slopes exposes soil under cultivation to erosion. Part
of this water is absorbed by soil increasing its weight, which can put an additional load on
the slope. Seepage and accumulation of irrigated water on slopes can raise the ground
water table. This can also be a result of wastewater discharge, water pipe leakage from
permanent and temporary storage facilities such as ponds and subsurface irrigation
facilities.
Substantially different, however, is the situation in those sliding areas, where human
activity is concentrated. It is so in the vicinity of towns and villages, in the main valleys
and basins of the mountainous part of Slovakia, where industry, construction of
residential quarters, communications, water reservoirs, etc., are concentrated. An
important new stability factor, which did not act here before is beginning to appear. It is
man‘s activity. The intensity of this activity sometimes exceeds the influence of the
present negatively acting natural factors (Davis et al., 2019). Landslides activated by
negative intervention of man‘s activity are of considerable dimensions, bring vast damage

and evoke considerable attention from the general public. Based on the investigation of
landslides in Slovakia it can be stated that 90 % of all landslides, which occurred in
populated areas in the last 30 years and which caused the greatest damage, were brought
about fully, or partly by man‘s intervention in the sensible stability regime of old
landslides (Acosta, 2022).
The fact that inconsiderate human activity and the effects of construction work on old
landslides are the most frequent cause of reactivation of movements in areas of intense
economic use are also confirmed by several foreign studies. Thus Nilsen and Turner
(2022) state that 80 % of the landslides, which have taken place since 1971 in California,
were brought about by artificial interventions. Similarly, Ojangole (2023) prove that in
Pensylvania artificially caused landslides amount to 90 % of newly occurred landslides.
The construction intervention in the slope environment according to Bodenlos and
Ericksen (2022) causes in it several simultaneously and consequently acting forces and
processes, which may end in various changes on the slopes. These may also reflect back
on the state and behaviour of technical works. The changes may be not only of a varied
type, but also of varied intensity and duration (temporary and permanent, slow and quick,
reversible and irreversible, etc.) The changes may be mediated directly or indirectly.
The Yellow River originates from the Tibetan Plateau and flows through nine provinces
and autonomous regions of China. The complex environment has led to many landslides
in the Yellow River Basin (YRB, China), restricting socioeconomic development.
Analyzing the effect of influencing factors on the spatial distribution of landslides is
important for landslide risk management. The factors that induce landslides in the YRB
include natural (mainly earthquakes, precipitation, river erosion, etc.) and human
activities (mainly agricultural and construction activities) (Bodenlos, 2018). Earthquakes
can damage the geotechnical structure, leading to many landslides distributed along fault
zones. For example, landslides triggered by earthquake were concentrated 40–55 km west
of the Haiyuan fault in the YRB.
The catastrophic modifications associated with human activities on the Earth‘s surface are
no negligible (Ericksen, 2021). Human activities change the topography, surface and
subsurface hydrology, becoming important factors in triggering landslides. Human
activities that affect slope stability mainly include construction and agricultural activities.
Agricultural irrigation raises the groundwater table, increases the self-weight of the soil
and weakens its mechanical properties. Human activity-induced groundwater level rise is

an important cause of landslide clusters in the South Jingyang Tableland of the YRB
(Peterson, 2022). Human activities have long-term ongoing impacts; for example, ―the
rapid transition from forests into cultivated or bare land is associated with a surge in
shallow landsliding that can persist for more than a decade
Researchers have highlighted the role of proactive land use and land cover management
in reducing landslide hazards (Ericksen, 2023). Human activities can lead to variations in
the spatial distribution of landslides. For example, the spatial distribution density of
landslides on residential land was almost five times that on bare land. Although dozens of
cases, show that human activities could be the triggering factor causing landslides, the
degree to which human activities affect the spatial density distribution of landslides in the
YRB is still unclear.
Hence, this study aims to explore this problem by conducting a quantitative analysis of
the correlation between the spatial distributions of landslides and human activities in the
YRB, a typical area with numerous landslides and a dense population (Ojangole et al.,
2022). An analysis of the effect of human activity intensity on the spatial distribution of
landslides requires the quantification of human activity intensity. Socioeconomic
statistical data reflect human activities within the administrative unit. However,
socioeconomic statistical data are not sufficient to reflect human activity intensity on a
detailed raster scale.
Some researchers such as Bodenlos and Erickse (2023) calculated human activity
intensity based on the sum of the construction land equivalent to different land-use types
in a region [26]. Land cover change focuses on changes in type and area and is not
sufficient to indicate human activity intensity. Currently, studies have used the weighted
summation of indicators such as nighttime light, land use and land cover, distance to
roads, distance to towns, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to calculate
human activity intensity. It is difficult to obtain long time series (annually updated) road
data, and it is difficult to determine whether vegetation changes in the NDVI are caused
by human activities. Land cover change can reflect human-induced vegetation
degradation. Moreover, land cover data can be used to detect areas of human activities
that nighttime light data cannot, such as cropland and some poverty regions.
Related to increases in population is the continuing high rate of deforestation due to
logging, burning, and development, a factor that increases landslide activity on the
world‘s slopes. In the early 1990‘s, the World Resources Institute estimated that the

world‘s tropical forests were disappearing at a rate of 16-20 million ha/yr (Collier‘s
Encyclopedia, 2017), an area roughly the size of Surinam. In the Amazon River Basin of
Brazil, alone, approximately 2.9 million ha of forest was destroyed during the 1994-95
burning season
2.2 The prevalence of rainfall induced landslides
Rainfall reduces the cohesion of rock and soil and increases the weight of rock and soil,
increasing the susceptibility of slopes to landslides. The landslide frequency increased as
the annual rainfall increased over a large spatial scale (Bodenlos and 2020). The
topographic slope reflects the topographic steepness on a small spatial scale, while the
topographic relief reflects the topographic steepness on a large spatial scale. Many steep
slopes exist in the YRB. Steep terrain provides conditions for landslide initiation and
movement. In addition, direct costs of small slope movements commonly are hidden in
larger, routine budget items for maintenance and repairs. Undoubtedly, indirect costs for
such items as traffic delays and economic disruption are a substantial part of the total
costs of landslides
Landslide hazards pose a great threat to people‘s lives and the safety of their property all
over the world, especially in mountainous areas. Rainfall is one of the main trigger factors
of landslides, and the induced mechanism is complicated and affected by multiple
environmental factors such as rainfall intensity, rainfall duration, landform and soil layer
structure, and has a high degree of regional specificity and sudden occurrence (Acosta,
2018). Rainfall has a significant impact on the mechanical properties of slope soil and
underground rock mass, which usually leads to soil softening and pore water pressure
increase, and then leads to landslide instability, forming a large number of destructive
debris flow or collapse
The occurrence process of landslides induced by rainfall includes soil and water loss and
erosion on the surface, and also involves water infiltration into the underground, causing
deep soil saturation, thus triggering a landslide. The migration and convergence patterns
of water flow under different rainfall characteristics have a key influence on the
triggering mechanism of a landslide (Opio, 2020). Extreme rainfall events caused by
climate change have become more frequent in recent years, exacerbating the risk of
landslides. Therefore, landslide prediction and risk management have received more and
more attention from the scientific community. This Special Issue is devoted to cuttingedge research on the causes, mechanisms, modeling and disaster management methods of

rain-induced landslides, with a view to providing new insights and effective mitigation
strategies.
Rainfall-induced landslides: Based on a variety of methods, such as model tests,
numerical simulation, artificial intelligence algorithms and theoretical deduction, past
studies have not deeply analyzed how rainfall causes a landslide and its prediction
methods, including the development and application of rainfall-induced landslide
monitoring systems, the establishment of risk prediction models and the analysis of
rainfall-induced landslide mechanisms and their influence on socio-economic wellbeing
of households (Owino, 2023).
The correlative mechanism and prediction method of rainfall-induced landslides are
studied by using physical models. Paswan et al. (2022) developed a rain-induced
landslide monitoring system to solve the problem of limited landslide prediction in
northern India during the rainy season which can record the real-time displacement and
volumetric water content of the slope. Taking the Woda landslide in the upper reaches of
the Jinsha River as the engineering background, Li et al. (2020) designed a model test to
study the development of paleo-landslides with cracks under the action of rainfall
infiltration and revealed the activation mechanism of rainfall and cracks on paleolandslides. The depth of slope infiltration directly affects the depth of landslide failure
and socio-economic recovery of households.
At the same time, some papers systematically analyze the landslide disasters induced by
rainfall through theoretical research, establishing a disaster analysis model and putting
forward a landslide failure time prediction method. Tseng et al. (2017) took the landslide
in Pingtung County, Taiwan Province, as the research object. By establishing the
evaluation indexes, namely, the rainfall trigger index (IRT) and an index of slope
environmental strength potential (ISESP), of landslide damage to land use after four heavy
rainfall events, they could effectively estimate the damage of rainfall-induced landslides
to land use.
Finally, in addition to rainfall-induced landslides, some scholars have focused their
research on the causes of slope instability and the resolution of uncertainty in slope
stability evaluation. Gui et al. [Contribution 13] took a large landslide-prone area in the
Central Mountain Range of Taiwan as the research object and adopted multi-temporal
satellite and aerial images, field investigations, geophysical tests and other technical

means to propose the main trigger factors that induced sudden and local slope instability
failure, namely, rainwater intrusion, the rising of river bed elevation and the erosion of
large slope foot banks. Even though no data are readily available on casualties or damage
costs in the lightly populated downstream valleys, Bodenlos and Ericksen (2018) reported
that cattle ranches and farms along the 60-km canyon and valley of the Río Barrancas
upstream from its junction with the Río Colorado completely disappeared; fields of
wheat, corn, and alfalfa were buried by debris. In addition, two small towns in the valley
were devastated
Heavy rainfall infiltration often leads to slope instability and poses a serious threat to the
lives and property of local residents. At present, the stability evaluation of rainfallinduced landslides is mainly divided into two steps. The first is to select the appropriate
rainfall infiltration model to analyze its infiltration mechanism and hydraulic effect. Then,
based on this, the safety factor of the landslide is calculated after the stress analysis. In
addition, satisfactory analysis (including artificial intelligence, etc.) of risk assessment
constituted an active area of research in the field of slope stability and landslides1,2. And
combining statistical analysis and physical modeling for risk assessment can better
understand the conditions of landslide and slope stability in different environments.
2.3 Landslide mitigation and prevention measures
Landslides pose a recurrent hazard to human life and livelihood in most parts of the
world, especially in some regions that have experienced rapid population and economic
growth. Hazards are mitigated mainly through precautionary means for instance, by
restricting or even removing populations from areas with a history of landslides, by
restricting certain types of land use where slope stability is in question, and by installing
early warning systems based on the monitoring of ground conditions such as strain in
rocks and soils, slope displacement, and groundwater levels. There are also various direct
methods of preventing landslides; these include modifying slope geometry, using
chemical agents to reinforce slope material, installing structures such as piles and
retaining walls, grouting rock joints and fissures, diverting debris pathways, and rerouting
surface and underwater drainage. Such direct methods are constrained by cost, landslide
magnitude and frequency, and the size of human settlements at risk.
Studies by Ericksen (2021) concluded that recognition and investigation of unstable areas
and the design of preventive treatment should be considered as essential phases of the
preliminary planning and design of any project on which the proposed construction might

induce land movements. It must be remembered that landslides may be caused by two
general types of construction activities: (a) the imposing of additional load, such as by
embankments, dams, or other structures; and (b) the changing of existing ground slope by
excavation, erosion, or other causes. It is true that landslides may occur where the
existing ground is undisturbed by man; this is evidenced by the numerous landslides
which occur in many areas remote from any construction activity (World Bank, 2021).
The possibility of such landslides affecting proposed facilities should not be overlooked,
particularly if the new facility is located on or crosses an old landslide. There have been
many instances of residential developments on old quiescent landslides, where various
conditions, perhaps unrelated to the residential construction, have caused the landslide to
become active, resulting in damage to buildings and structures within the slide area.
Development and construction over a large area may obliterate all evidence of the
original landslide, leaving the purchaser blissfully unaware of any hazard.
In highway construction the proposed location may cross an old inactive landslide of such
areal extent that it is overlooked in the usual routine soil survey. Or, the engineer may
recognize and treat small local unstable areas without realizing that they are merely.
manifestations of large-scale land movement. It is seldom that any large-scale landslide,
however old, does not leave some telltale evidence which can be detected by an engineer
trained to look for the proper features. Once the slide area is identified by this or other
means, a detailed ground study will commonly reveal further evidence of previous land
movement. Field methods for recognizing and identifying old landslides are described in
Chapter Four. Having identified an existing landslide, active or latent, the engineer can
then determine whether avoidance is economically practicable; if the slide cannot be
avoided the necessary investigation can be made to determine the extent and nature of
preventive treatment required.
In any area of inherently low stability, especially where slides are known to be prevalent,
the design of any major structure should be preceded by thorough investigation.
Particularly in the construction of embankments on steep slopes in localities of
questionable stability, each such site should be viewed with suspicion and thoroughly
explored during preliminary stages of the project. Similarly, the design of cut slopes in
such areas should be carefully scrutinized; in regions where instability is evidenced by
land movement on existing routes, exploration of all proposed major excavation may be
required (Bodenlos and Ericksen, 2018). One error which is all too prevalent in the

investigation of potential landslides is that of basing the analysis and design on data
derived from shallow borings or test pits. All too often the material recorded in shallow
borings as "solid formation" or "bedrock" may be merely float rock, boulders, or a thin
layer of hard material underlain by a dangerously weak horizon. In excavation areas the
borings should extend below the proposed grade; the foundation for embankments or
other structures should be explored to whatever depth might be affected by the proposed
loading.
The investigation aimed at slide prevention should be a cooperative project by the
geologist and the soil engineer, or be made under the jurisdiction of an engineer who is
thoroughly familiar with both of these phases of engineering. To be of greatest value, the
geologic and soils studies should be both general and specific to household socioeconomic culnaerabilities. That is, a general or regional knowledge of the soils and
geology in the area under investigation will be helpful in estimating the landslide
potentials on a specific project, but such knowledge cannot take the place of detailed
studies along the proposed right of –way
Bodenlos and Ericksen (2018) found that prevention of all types of landslides may be
accomplished by one or more of the following methods: (a) reduction of activating forces,
(b) increasing the forces resisting movement, and (c) avoidance or elimination of the
slide. Reduction in the activating forces can be accomplished by two general methods -
removal of material from the portion of the slide which provides the driving force tending
to cause movement, and sub-drainage to eliminate hydrostatic pressure and/or to diminish
the weight of the soil mass by reducing moisture content. However, the stabilizing effect
of sub-drainage is generally due primarily to increasing the shear resistance rather than by
reduction of the motivating forces.
There are a great many methods for increasing the forces resisting slide movement,
including the following: subdrainage, in order to increase the shear resistance of the soil;
elimination of weak zones or potential surfaces of rupture by stripping or by breaking up
or benching of smooth sloping surfaces; construction of restraining structures such as
piles, walls, cribs, or toe support fills; and solidification of loose granular material by
chemical treatment.
Although surface drainage alone will seldom correct an active landslide, any
improvement in surface drainage will be beneficial. In the case of potential landslides,

where no movement has occurred prior to construction, surface drainage may result in
greater returns from the investment than any other type of preventive treatment, even
though other preventive measures may be required in conjunction with the surface
drainage (Bodenlos and Ericksen, 2018). Surface runoff or the water flowing from springs
or seeps should never be allowed to drain into or across an unstable area or potential
landslide. Methods of improving surface drainage include reshaping of slopes,
construction of paved ditches, installation of flumes or conduits, and paving or
bituminous treatment of slopes.
Acosta (2018) recommended that government agencies and other policy-making bodies in
the Western Hemisphere need to develop a better understanding of the socioeconomic
significance of landslides. Such understanding will allow rational allocation of funds
needed for landslide research, for avoidance, prevention, control, and warning, and for
post-failure repair and reconstruction














CHAPTER THREE
RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
3.0 Introduction
This chapter describes the methodology that was used by the researcher to carry out the
research study and some of the areas that were covered are: Research design, area and
population of the study, sample size, sampling techniques, research instruments, data
quality control, data analysis and ethical issues in the study.
3.1 Research Design
The research study adopted a cross-sectional design using both qualitative and
quantitative research approaches to analyze the Impact of landslides on social economic
wellbeing of households in Nametsi sub county, Bududa district. This helped the
researcher to generate more sufficient data and relevant information which supported the
variables and objectives of the research study.
3.2 Sample size
The population was selected from two parishes of within Nametsi Sub County and it
comprised of parish chiefs (2) residents of Nametsi Sub County (88), local leaders (10)
and lastly. A sample size of 80 respondents will be reached using Krejcie and Morgan
(1973) methods of determining sample size.

3.3 Sample selection
The researcher used the listed sampling techniques to carry out the research study:

3.3.1 Simple random sampling
The researcher used simple random sampling to select Residents of Nametsi, this
technique will involve giving a number to every subject or member of the accessible
population, placing the numbers in the container and then picking any number at random.
The subject corresponding to the numbers were included in the sample. Simple random
sampling was used on Residents of Nametsi because they of this category and this
enabled the researcher to get a representative sample for the research study and allow
generalizability to a larger population with a margin error that is statistically
determinable.
3.3.2. Purposive sampling
Purposive sampling was used on parish chiefs and local leaders because the researcher the
researcher was able to move from one Parish Chief to another until the required sample is
reached and these respondents can easily read and understand what is in the questionnaire
making it the right sampling technique for this research study.
3.4 Research instruments
The researcher used both questionnaires and interview guide to carry out this research
study.
3.4.1 Questionnaire
The researcher used a self-administered questionnaire as a research tool to collect data
from the respondents. The questionnaire had three sections. Section A included
respondents‘ demographic information, Section B, C and D focused on general and closed
ended statements which were in accordance with the research topic.
A 5 Likert scale of measurement will be used on close ended questions based on a scale
of strongly agree (5), agree (4), unsure (3), disagree (2), strongly disagree (1).
Questionnaires will be used because they allowed respondents to provide firsthand
information which was free of bias and was easy to use.
3.4.2 Interviews
Data was collected using interviews with the help of an interview guide. An interview
guide is a research instrument that contains a set of questions on defined issues under
study that are put to respondents on face to face basis (Saunders, et al, 2007). These
instruments contained mostly open-ended questions. The interview guide was used on

local leaders as respondents because this category of study respondents has more
knowledge that could not fully be captured using questionnaires.
3.5 Data Processing and Analysis
3.5.1 Quantitative data analysis
Data processing was done through editing of the data which was coded for further data
analysis. After data processing, quantitative data analysis will be carried out by simple
frequency tabulation using a Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS). Data was
then presented using different methods such as simple frequency tables which ultimately
will help to measure the Variables being interpreted in the study. This is because data
presentation requires clear portrayal of the findings presented, and the listed method
above clearly fulfills that purpose.
3.5.2 Pearson Correlations and Regression Analysis
Pearson Correlations and regression analysis was used to establish the effect of the study
variables of the topic under study. This type of inferential statistics was easy to compute
and interpret and help in making conclusions.
3.5.3 Qualitative data analysis
On the other hand, qualitative data gathered from open-ended questions in the interview
guide will be summarized. A style called content analysis was used to test the validity
and authenticity. Then, data was categorized according to the sub-themes identified
earlier.
3.6 Research procedure
The researcher will select and present a research topic to the head of research which will
be approved. Thereafter the researcher will develop a research proposal. After approval of
the research proposal, the researcher obtained an introductory letter from the Head of
department which was presented to the relevant authorities in the study area for data
collection. Thereafter the researcher wrote a report which was presented to the
department for further examination.

3.7 Ethical considerations
3.7.1 Consent
The researcher got approved consent from the respondents. Respondents willingly
decided to participate in the study after the researcher explaining to them its purpose. The
prepared instruments helped the researcher to collect objective information hence fears of
personal views will be reduced.
3.7.2 Confidentiality
Respondents were assured of confidentiality by keeping information given confidential.
And their identity was kept anonymous or pseudo names were used. This increased on
disclosure of information.
3.7.3 Fraud and plagiarism
Mugenda and Mugenda (2007) argued that fraud involves faking data. It also includes
false presentation of research methodologies. According to copy rights law, in many
countries including Uganda, both fraud and plagiarism are crime punishable by panel
code. To avoid fraud and plagiarism, the researcher personally collect, analyze and
present data and endeavored to present exactly what the study subject reveal.
3.8 Validity and reliability
3.8.1 Validity
The validity of an instrument is defined as the ability of an instrument to measure what it
is intended to measure. The validity of the questionnaire was tested using the content
validity test (CVI). To arrive at the relevancy of the questionnaire, the researcher
designed instruments that yielded content –valid data by first specifying the domain of
indictors that were relevant to the concept being measured. A content-valid data measure
which contained all possible items will be used.



Where, Relevant (R), Neutral (N), to Irrelevant (IR).



3.8.2 Reliability
The reliability of the instruments was tested using the test re-test method of reliability and
Cron-bach alpha tests to determine the reliability index with the help of SPSS. Data was
collected from 5 residents not among those in the sample. The principle of reliability as
far as research instruments is concerned is clearly put forward by Amin (2005) that an
instrument is reliable if it produces the same results wherever it is repeatedly used to
measure a trait or a concept from the same population and under similar circumstances.

of the respondents strongly disagreed nor disagreed. A very high mean of 4.47 indicated
identifying what students are lacking can help improve on their academic performance.
Respondents were asked to reveal if making afforestation and planting of other vegetation
can hold soils together can and act as a strategy to prevent landslides and 69% of the
respondents strongly agreed, 27% of the respondents agreed, 4% of the respondents were
undecided, none of the respondents disagreed nor strongly disagreed a very high mean of
4.56 indicated that afforestation and planting of other vegetation to hold soils together
hence can act as a strategy to prevent landslides. This study finding was in line with a
study conducted by Madoi (2020) that afforestation with the right species of tress in
different parts of the country can help in prevention of landslides.
A very high overall mean of 4.34 indicated that there are a number of interventions that
can be employed to mitigate landslides in areas that are prone to them.

CHAPTER FIVE
DISCUSSION OF FINDINGS, CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
5.0 Introduction
This chapter presents the discussion of study findings‘ conclusions and recommendations
revealed about the effect of poverty on academic performance of learners in Primary
Schools in Bududa Town Council Bududa District
5.1 Discussion of Findings
5.1.1 How human activities contribute to landslides
Findings indicated that failure to draw the poor in to the design of development program
is a determinant of poverty. This study finding was similar to that Goffmans (2021) who
conducted a study in South Africa and found out that most poor people within this
community have been as a result of failure to draw them in the design of development.
Additionally, findings also indicated that natural calamities such as drought and man –
made disasters induce transitional poverty this was supported by respondent‘s llll2 and
ddaaq2. This study finding was similar to that of Davis (2020) who conducted a research
study in Tanzania and found out that natural calamities disorganize people‘s poverty and
in return make them poor.
Lastly under this objective, findings of the study also indicated that lack of participation
in decision making in civil social and cultural life is a determinant of poverty. This
finding was in line Oburu (2017) who conducted a research study from Kenya and found
out that non participation decision making has led to wrong investments contributing to
high levels of poverty.
5.1.2. The prevalence of rainfall induced landslides
Findings indicated that there are many long term challenges such as chronic stress due to
poverty that affect academic performance. This study finding was in line with Galloway
(2019) who conducted a research study in Kenya and found out poverty results in to stress
which in return affects academic performance.
Additionally, findings indicated that poverty leads to situations causing emotional and
social struggles affecting academic performance. This study finding was similar to that of

WHO (2021) which noted that poverty brings about situations that are friendly to
emotional and social struggles which in return affect academic performance.
Lastly findings indicated that poor emotional health is caused by lack of parental support
may cause an increase in disruptive behavior affecting academic performance. This was
in line with a study conducted in Uganda by Opio et al, (2017) who found out that that
any disruptive behviour in family or communities negatively affects academic
performance of learners.
5.1.3 Landslide mitigation and prevention measures
Findings indicated that correct assessment is critical to identification of student‘s
weakness and strengths and can improve academic performance. This finding was in line
with a study conducted by Caserta (2020) from Zimbabwe who found out that correct
assessment in schools have helped students improve on performance.
Findings indicated that that recruiting teachers with skills is foundation of increasing
academic achievements in schools. This finding was in line with a study conducted by
Caserta (2020) from Zimbabwe who found out those teachers with skills give students
these skills who in return improve academic performance.
Findings indicated that identifying what students are lacking can help improve on their
academic performance. This finding was in line with that of James (2020) who conducted
a research study and noted that identifying what students lack can help design for them
better performance measures.
5.2 Conclusions
5.2.1. How human activities contributes to landslides
Findings concluded that failure to draw the poor in to the design of development program
is a determinant of poverty, that natural calamities such as drought and man –made
disasters induce transitional poverty and lastly that lack of participation in decision
making in civil social and cultural life is a determinant of poverty.
5.2.2. The prevalence of rainfall induced landslides
Findings concluded that there are many long-term challenges such as chronic stress due to
poverty that affect academic performance that poor emotional health is caused by lack of
parental support may cause an increase in disruptive behavior affecting academic

performance and lastly that correct assessment is critical to identification of student‘s
weakness and strengths.
5.2.3. Landslide mitigation and prevention measures
Findings concluded that correct assessment is critical to identification of student‘s
weakness and strengths and can improve academic performance, that that recruiting
teachers with skills is foundation of increasing academic achievements in schools and
lastly that identifying what students are lacking can help improve on their academic
performance.
5.3 Recommendations
Basing on the discussion of the study findings and conclusions of this report, the study
recommends the following to different stakeholders.
There should be more investments by different Governments in a number of strategies to
ensure improved academic performance.
There is need for the to sensitize the community and people on causes of poverty
5.4 Suggested areas for further research
Basing on the study findings, the researcher recommends further research on the
following research topics:
Role of Government in prevention of poverty
Impact of poverty on students‘ academic performance.

How human activities contribute to landslides
SD
D N A
SA
Excavation of cuts increase the slope angle if carried out without
specialist advise





Farming activities on slopes involve removal of vegetation
cover contributing to landslides





Human activities change the topography leading to landslides





Artificial interventions are one of the causes of landslides





Prevalence of rainfall induced landslides
Rainfall reduces the cohesion of rock and soil and increases the
weight of rock & soil increasing chances of landslides





Rainfall has a significant impact on mechanical properties of
slope soil & underground rock mass





The migration and convergence of patterns of water flow have
influence on triggering landslides





Landslides pose a great thereat to people‘s lives and property





Land slide mitigation and prevention measures







Precautionary means by restricting populations from areas with
history of landslides





Installing structures such as piles and retaining walls and diverting
debris can work as a direct method.






Restricting developments in some areas prone to landslides may
act as measure





Afforestation and planting of other vegetation that can hold soils
together can act as a strategy to prevent landslides.
