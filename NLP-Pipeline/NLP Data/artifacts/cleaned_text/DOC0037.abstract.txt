Non-Governmental Organizations being so crucial in developing countries for instance Uganda,
their financial sustainability is a challenge since most of them rely on donor funding and the
donors expectations need to be met. The purpose of the study was to determine the effect of
financial management practices on financial sustainability of Non-Governmental Organizations
in Uganda. The study mainly examined the effects of financial management practices on
financial sustainability of Non-Governmental Organizations. The theory of budgeting,
contingency management theory and sustainability theory were used to underpin this study. The
study used a cross-sectional study design. The target population was forty-three comprising of
senior account managers, Program managers, finance managers and administrators.
Questionnaires were used as the main data collection instrument which the study relied on to
collect data and was later analyzed by use of descriptive statistics in form of frequencies, mean,
standard deviation and analysis such as Pearson correlation and regression analysis. The findings
revealed that the financial management practices which were financial reporting, budgeting
control and internal controls have a positive effect on the financial sustainability of NGOs. The
study recommends that NGOs should emphasize and monitor financial management practices
such as financial reporting, budgeting control and internal controls due to their significant
influence on the financial sustainability of NGOs.
