ABSTRACT
Cowpea leaves are a nutritious vegetable important in African diets, particularly in
Uganda. The research indicated that their utilization is limited by post-harvest losses
and nutrient loss during traditional preparation. This study aimed to enhance the
sensory and nutritional attributes of an instant cowpea leaf-based soup. The
research investigated the impact of incorporating additives such as monosodium
glutamate, mono- and di-glycerides of fatty acids, and whey protein on the soup's
physicochemical properties and consumer acceptability. The research employed the
use of cowpea leaf and orange-fleshed sweet potato flour as starch-based sources,
and the soup was processed using extrusion cooking. Proximate and mineral
composition were analyzed according AOAC methods, and sensory evaluation
determined consumer preferences. This research sought to improve the nutritional
value and consumer appeal of cowpea leaf soup, to promote its consumption and
address micronutrient deficiencies.

CHAPTER ONE
1.0 BACKGROUND
Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) is a global vegetable whose cultivation is believed to
have begun from Africa more than 5000 years ago. It belongs to kingdom (Plantae),
genus (Vigna), and Species (unguiculata). Cowpea is a valuable component in the
farming systems of the majority of resource poor rural households in Sub-Saharan
Africa (SSA) for its various attributes. It is cultivated majorly as a vegetable as well
as a cover and fodder crop. The cowpea leaves, immature pods and mature pods are
an important source of micro and macro nutrients like protein, crude fibre, minerals
like (calcium, iron, zinc, phosphorus), and vitamins. The tender green leaves contain
15 times more minerals, micro and macronutrients than in grains(Kizito, 2022)
Cowpea leaves are widely consumed in Africa due to their rich nutritional profile,
particularly their high levels of vitamins, minerals, and dietary fiber. Cowpea leaves
are consumed by up to 99.4% of households in Uganda and are often served during
important occasions such as funerals, child naming ceremonies, and visits. In
Uganda, cowpea is ranked third in importance, and the Kumi district in Eastern
Uganda is the largest producer and consumer of the crop, with 90% of the country’s
production (Kizito, 2022). The consumption of cowpea as a fresh vegetable has
rapidly increased in the semi-arid zone of Africa. There are no released varieties on
record for vegetable use in Africa. (Kizito, 2022). However, traditional preparation
methods often lead to significant nutrient loss and compromise sensory attributes
such as texture, taste, and color.
A soup is a flavorful and nutritious liquid food usually served at the beginning of a
meal or a snack. The flavor of the main ingredient used should remain prominent
(Fern et al., 2020). Green leafy vegetables are widely used in the preparation of
vegetable soups, the most common being spinach and chard. Green leafy vegetables
are a good source of dietary fiber and are rich in chlorophyll, vitamins C, K, iron,
and folic acid, among others. Different types of soup powders are available on the
market. Most of the soup powders are usually made from combination starch-rich
raw materials and mixed with different vegetables. Corn flour is used as a thickener


and stabilizer agent in soups. Spices in powder form can be added to improve the
palatability of soup.
An instant soup is a pre-packaged, ready-to-make soup that requires minimal
preparation. Typically, it comes in powder, paste, or dehydrated form and only needs
the addition of hot water (or sometimes milk) to be ready for consumption. The key
Features include quick preparation usually, shelf-Stable due to dehydration or
preservation techniques, convenient that is; Ideal for people looking for fast meal
options. It has a variety of forms, available as powder, granules, freeze-dried
ingredients, or concentrated paste.
Food additives are substances added to food to preserve flavor or enhance its taste,
appearance, or other qualities and are inevitable in packaged food. The proper use
of food additives plays an important role in modern food industry. Firstly, food
additives not only function in food preservation, but also help to enhance certain
qualities of food such as color, flavor and flexibility, as well as improving the
nutrition of food. For example, proper food nutrition enhancers can be added to
make up nutrition loss during food processing. Food additives have been used by man
since the earliest times. The safety of food additives is an important issue related
to the food industry, so the use of additives in food should be controlled by laws in
many countries.(ELshreif et al., 2023)
In Uganda, where 29% of children under five are stunted (Uganda Bureau of Statistics
[UBOS], 2021) and micronutrient deficiencies are prevalent, improving the
nutritional quality of commonly consumed foods like cowpea leaves is essential.
This study aims to improve the sensory properties, reconstitution quality, and
nutrient retention of instant cowpea leafy soup by optimizing its formulation and
processing conditions.
PROBLEM STATEMENT
Despite the availability and affordability of cowpea leaves, the average dietary
intake of essential vitamins and minerals remains below the recommended daily
allowance, partly due to the improper preparation of these vegetables (FAO, 2020).
For example, the loss of vital nutrients during cooking can reach 50% for some
vitamins and minerals. Traditional preparation methods, such as overcooking and


boiling without appropriate seasoning, often lead to significant nutrient losses and
reduce the sensory qualities of this soup. The current practices result in the
degradation of heat-sensitive nutrients like vitamin C and affect the bioavailability
of minerals, thus reducing the nutritional benefits of the leafy vegetable.
The current cowpea leafy vegetable soup that was prepared by extrusion cooking, a
high-temperature short-time method (HTST) targeted women of reproductive age as
well as children 5 years and below to provide a healthy, easy-to-prepare dish to
reduce the prevalence of nutritional deficiencies.
However, the sensory attributes do not meet consumer expectations such as texture,
as the soup lumps upon reconstitution, smoothness, taste, and aroma as compared
to common soups prepared traditionally. The nutritional value of the soup also does
not provide the recommended daily intake of the main nutrients for the target group
such as iron, zinc, folic acid, dietary fiber was all halved after analysis of the final
product (Akaba et al., 2024 unpublished).
There is also a noticeable gap in research and development focused on utilizing and
adding value to cowpea leaves. This neglect leaves consumers without adequate
support in accessing nutritious food products derived from this valuable resource.
Consequently, opportunities to address nutritional deficiencies through cowpea
leaves are being missed.
To mitigate post-harvest losses and enhance the utilization of cowpea leaves, an
instant cowpea soup was developed using extrusion cooking, a high-temperature
short-time (HTST) processing method. While extrusion cooking offers advantages in
terms of nutrient retention and microbial safety, there are still unknowns and
challenges specific to its application in cowpea-based instant soups. These include:
Impact of Extrusion Parameters: The precise effects of varying extrusion parameters
(e.g., temperature, screw speed, feed rate) on the nutritional composition, sensory
attributes, and reconstitution properties of cowpea-based soups are not fully
understood. Optimizing these parameters to maximize nutrient retention while
maintaining desirable sensory qualities requires further investigation.
Ingredient Interactions During Extrusion: The interactions between cowpea leaves
and other ingredients, including fortificants and additives, during the extrusion


process are complex. It is unclear how these interactions affect the stability of
nutrients and the overall quality of the final product.
Effect on Bioavailability: While HTST processing can help retain certain nutrients,
its effect on the bioavailability of key nutrients like iron and zinc in cowpea-based
soups needs further study. It is crucial to ensure that the processing method not only
retains nutrients but also preserves their availability for absorption by the body.
Beyond the extrusion process itself, the current prototype of this instant cowpea
leaf-based soup faces several challenges that impede its consumer acceptance and
market potential. These challenges include:
Inadequate Sensory Characteristics: The soup exhibits unsatisfactory flavor, texture,
and aroma, negatively impacting the overall consumption experience. Specifically,
the flavor lacks depth and balance, and the color deteriorates during processing.
Poor Reconstitution Quality: The soup's texture is problematic, as it does not
reconstitute properly, often resulting in lumpiness and incomplete dissolution.
Nutritional Insufficiency: The nutritional composition of the soup does not
adequately meet the recommended dietary allowances, particularly for key
nutrients such as zinc, iron, and protein.
These limitations, stemming from both processing and formulation issues, prevent
the instant cowpea leaf-based soup from effectively addressing nutritional needs
and gaining widespread consumer acceptance. Therefore, this research is necessary
to investigate ingredient enhancements and processing modifications, with a focus
on optimizing the extrusion process, to improve the soup's sensory qualities,
nutritional value, consumer appeal, and usability. This initiative will involve
fortifying the soup and incorporating stabilizers and emulsifiers to enhance its
texture, stability, and shelf life. For example, monosodium glutamate will be
explored for its potential to enhance umami flavor and allow for sodium reduction,
a mixture of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids will be used to improve
reconstitution and prevent phase separation, and whey protein will be added to
improve creaminess, mouthfeel, and protein content.


Therefore, this research aimed at improving the nutritional (iron, zinc and folic acid)
and sensory quality (smoothness) of the product to enhance its acceptability and
consumption.

1.2 RESEARCH OBJECTIVES
1.2.1 Main Objective:
To determine the contribution of selected enhancers to the sensory and nutritional
attributes of the instant cowpea leaf-based soup.
Specific objectives
1.To determine the physicochemical characteristics of the instant cowpea leaf-based
soup across the three treatment groups.
2. To determine the consumer acceptability of the instant cowpea leaf-based soup
across the three treatment groups.
1.2.2 RESEARCH QUESTIONS
1.What are the physicochemical characteristics of the instant cowpea leaf-based
soup across the three treatment groups?
2.What is the consumer acceptability of the instant cowpea leaf-based soup across
the three treatment groups?
1.3 JUSTIFICATION
Uganda has a high prevalence of micronutrient deficiencies, particularly among
children and women of reproductive age. The study seeks to improve the
bioavailability of Vitamin A, iron, zinc, and folic acid in an instant cowpea leafy
soup, addressing critical nutritional gaps. In developing countries, especially African
countries, malnutrition remains a major health problem in infants and pre- school
children.(Olapade et al., 2012)
High Post-Harvest Losses affecting cowpea leaves, despite their nutritional value,
have a short shelf life, leading to significant post-harvest losses of 10-50%.
Developing an instant soup will enhance preservation, reduce wastage, and increase
utilization.


Limited Research on Cowpea Leaves for Instant Soup. While cowpea leaves are
widely consumed in Africa, there is limited research on their use in processed food
products like instant soup. This study will provide insights into optimizing processing
techniques for better retention of nutrients and sensory attributes.
Consumer Acceptability Issues. Previous formulations of instant cowpea soup faced
challenges in texture, flavor, and reconstitution quality, leading to low consumer
acceptance. This study aims to enhance these properties by incorporating functional
additives.
Market Potential and Convenience. The demand for instant, easy-to-prepare, and
nutrient-dense foods is increasing. This research aims to develop a shelf-stable,
highly nutritious soup product that meets consumer needs for convenience and
health benefits.
Meeting the Demand for Convenient and Nutritious Foods: There is a growing demand
for convenient, easy-to-prepare, and nutrient-dense food products. This research
aligns with this market trend by developing a shelf-stable, highly nutritious soup that
meets consumer needs for convenience and health benefits. Such a product has the
potential to address both nutritional deficiencies and consumer preferences in a
rapidly changing food environment
1.4 SIGNIFICANCE
Improved Nutritional Intake. By enhancing the bioavailability of iron, zinc, and folic
acid, the study contributes to reducing malnutrition and anemia among vulnerable
populations.
Iron regulates several biochemical processes such as electron transfer reactions,
gene regulation, binding and transport of oxygen, and regulation of cell growth and
differentiation. Its deficiency contributes to anemia. It is essential for fetal growth
and development, and thus iron demand is high during pregnancy and any shortage
onsets the intrauterine growth restriction, premature delivery, low birth weight and
postpartum depression, to name a few. South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa account
for the highest anemia prevalence in pregnant women and pre-school children of
47.7 and 55.1 %, and 45.8 and 59.9%, respectively(Janaswamy et al., 2021)


Enhanced Shelf Life and Marketability. The development of a stable, fortified soup
product will extend the usability of cowpea leaves and create economic
opportunities for farmers and food processors.
Better Sensory and Functional Properties. The study will optimize the soup’s
formulation to improve texture, flavor, and overall acceptability, increasing its
potential for commercialization.
Contribution to Food Security and Value Addition. The research supports food
security by promoting the use of underutilized but nutrient-rich vegetables. It also
adds value to agricultural produce, supporting rural livelihoods.
Scientific Contribution. The findings will provide data on optimizing processing
techniques for cowpea leaf-based products, potentially influencing future food
formulation and processing strategies.

CHAPTER TWO
2.0 LITERATURE REVIEW
2.1 Cowpea production worldwide and in Uganda
Cowpea, Vigna unguiculata (L.) is the most important legume grown in the semi-arid
tropics and one of the world's major legumes. It is adapted to the Sahelian climate
which is characterized by low rainfall and poor soil fertility. It originated and was
first domesticated in Southern Africa and was later moved to East and West Africa
and Asia. It is a multi-purpose indigenous crop that grows largely in the tropics of
sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). It is reported that 95.6% of the area under cultivation of
cowpea leaves worldwide in 2017 was in Sub Saharan Africa. Uganda is ranked the
8th largest producer of cowpea in Africa, grown by over 2.2 million smallholder
farmers with total annual production of nearly 22,000 tons. Cowpea in Uganda is
grown throughout the country but Eastern and Northern region being the 1st and 2nd
largest producers in the country.(Pokhrel, 2024)
2.2 Nutritional Significance of Cowpea Leaves
Cowpea leaves are an excellent source of vitamins A, C, and K, minerals like iron
and calcium, and dietary fiber. Their high antioxidant content provides health
benefits such as improved immunity and reduced oxidative stress. However,
improper processing can lead to significant nutrient losses, necessitating optimized
cooking and formulation strategies to retain their full nutritional potential.
Cowpea leaves possess a rich nutritional profile, serving as a crucial reservoir of
essential nutrients such as proteins, vitamins, and minerals. Cowpea leaves possess
significant levels of carotenoids, including lutein, violaxanthin, α-carotene, 9-cis-βcarotene, and zeaxanthin. They contain a considerable amount of phytochemicals
such as flavonoids and phenolic acids. These leaves are also characterized by their
low-fat content and significant contribution to dietary fibre intake(Mungofa &
Beswa, 2024)
Consumption of cowpea leaves improves the activity of both micro and macronutrients in the human body by preventing iron and protein-calorie deficiencies
(Pottorff et al., 2012; Alemu et al., 2016). Organoleptically, cowpea leaves are mild
and good tasting compared favorably with other tropical vegetables like amaranth,


spinach, pumpkins, lettuce, and sweet potatoes (Mamiro et al., 2011). Cowpea
leaves also compare well nutritionally with other tropical leaf vegetables like
Solanum nigrum, Amaranthus sp., Ipomoea batatas, and Cucurbita moschata
(Gonçalves et al., 2016). Cowpea leafy vegetables can increase the nutrient content
of less nutrient-dense foods due to their significantly high nutrient content (Wasswa,
2021). A study by Prange (2012) reported that with an increase in age, cowpea leaves
indicated an increase in carbohydrates, and a reduction in their protein content
while maintaining a consistent level of fat and ash content. Cowpea leaves are
priced lower than animal protein Devi (2020) and possess a higher protein content
than seeds during the cropping season, with protein percentages ranging from 24.7%
to 25.7% for seeds and 29.4% to 33.1% for leaves (Prange, 2012). A study by Mamiro
et al. (2011) found that cowpea leaves produce 9 times as many calories, 1.5 times
as much protein, 90 times more calcium, and 1,000 times more ascorbic acid and
beta carotene than the crop's grains.

Cowpea is a rich source of proteins (28-42 g/100 g), total essential amino acids
(0.027-0.031 mg/100g), crude fiber (10.09-25g/100g), carotenoids (32.74-
36.55mg/100g), iron (66-75 mg/100g), calcium (17.1-39.87 mg/100 g) and, zinc
(5.22-12.91mg/100g). According to Carneiro da Silva et al. (2018), cowpea is a
significant dietary protein source that nutritionally complements low-protein cereal
and tuber crops and is extremely important to millions of people in developing
nations, estimated 38 million families, or 194 million individuals (Davis et al., 2007;
Owade et al., 2019). Larochelle et al. (2013) showed that cowpea crude protein
concentrations of 561 cowpea leaf samples taken from 10 accessions and around 10
landraces in Tanzania and Uganda ranged from 21.5% to 40.3%.

Cowpea leaves contain vitamins and minerals, that are uncommon in most exotic
plants, and consuming AIVs helps poor rural households combat malnutrition (Ojiako
& Kayode, 2014; Okello et al., 2015; Osho & Olasanmi, 2019; Omomowo & Babalola,
2021). Leafy cowpea contain trace amounts of zinc, copper, manganese, sodium,
iron, and selenium (Hamid et al., 2015). A study by Kim et al. (2014), reported that
the mineral content of various cowpea cultivars varied greatly. Okonya (2014),


showed that young cowpea obtained from Tanzania and Uganda had carotene values
ranging from 4.1 to 30.5 mg/100 g and iron concentrations ranging from 140.5 to
3994.7 g/100g. In comparison to cooked cowpea seeds, cooked cowpea leaves have
a calcium content that is seven times higher, an iron content that is three times
higher, and the phosphorus concentration of cooked cowpea leaves is equivalent to
50% of that found in cooked seeds.

Cowpea is rich in essential vitamins like B vitamins (B6 &B9), riboflavin, thiamin,
niacin, and pantothenic acid, as well as β - Carotene, Ascorbic acid (Asare et al.,
2013; Ngalamu et al., 2014). The amount of readily available nutrients, such as
vitamin C, in leafy cowpea, is decreased by sun-drying before cooking, adding crude
sodium carbonate salt to the cooking water, and heating them for an extended
period (Gonçalves et al., 2016). Also, Okonya, (2014), reported that children who
ate cowpea leaves had higher blood hemoglobin levels and more bioavailable betacarotene. Vitamins C and E are crucial for women of reproductive age because they
function as antioxidants, which are substances that disarm free radicals and shield
cells and tissues from oxidative deterioration (Otunchieva et al., 2022). When
comparing raw cowpea seeds to raw cowpea leaves (not dried), the cowpea leaves
contain around 20% more thiamine and twice as much riboflavin. Similar to cowpea
seeds, cowpea leaves are a highly valuable reservoir of folic acid, with quantities of
334 μg and 2012 μg of free and total folate per 100 g of solids in their raw form (B.B.
Singh, 1997).
2.3 Post-harvest handling of cowpea leaves
Role of Orange Flesh Sweet Potato (OFSP) Flour
OFSP flour is rich in beta-carotene, which enhances vitamin A intake, a critical
nutrient for vision and immune health. It also improves the texture and color of food
products, making it an ideal ingredient for fortifying cowpea soup while enhancing
its sensory appeal.
Sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) is of great nutritional and health significance,
mainly due to its beta-carotene and anthocyanin properties(Omoba et al., 2020)


Importance of Functional Additives in Food Processing
Additives play a crucial role in food formulation by enhancing flavor, texture, and
stability. The following additives are particularly relevant to this study:
Monosodium Glutamate (MSG): Commonly used to enhance umami flavor, MSG
improves overall taste perception and consumer acceptance. Commercially
prepared soup mixes are usually made using (MSG) Monosodium Glutamate to
enhance desired flavor. MSG restores some of the original flavors, increases
palatability and raises overall flavor level while reducing sodium chloride
concentration (Abeysinghe & Illeperuma, 2006)
Mono- and Di-Glycerides of Fatty Acids: These emulsifiers help improve texture by
preventing phase separation and ensuring smooth consistency.
Whey Protein: Enhances the mouthfeel and protein content of the soup, making it
more nutritious and appealing.
Caramel: Caramel, defined as coloring agent and as an anti- oxidant, is being used
in several kinds of food products.(Sengar & Sharma, 2014) Used for color
enhancement, caramel provides an appealing golden-brown hue, improving the
visual acceptability of the soup.
2.4 Impact of Processing on Nutrient Retention
High-temperature, short-time (HTST) processing techniques such as extrusion
cooking help retain heat-sensitive nutrients like vitamin C while ensuring microbial
safety. This method minimizes nutrient loss while maintaining a desirable texture
and consistency in instant soups.
2.5 Consumer Acceptability and Market Trends
Consumer panels are composed of individuals from the target market, providing
feedback that reflects real-world consumer preferences. This type of panel is crucial
in consumer acceptance studies, which aim to predict market success based on
consumer reactions to sensory attributes (Maurya, 2024).
Consumer studies indicate that texture, flavor, and ease of preparation significantly
influence the acceptability of instant soup products. Research suggests that the


incorporation of nutrient-dense ingredients and functional additives enhances
overall consumer satisfaction and repeat purchases.
For biofortification to be effective, it must align with consumer preferences. Studies
underscore the importance of sensory evaluation in determining the acceptability of
biofortified products (Mbwana et al., 2021). In regions where cowpea is not
traditionally used in soups, its integration must consider local culinary practices and
taste preferences.







CHAPTER THREE
3.0 METHODOLOGY
3.1 Raw materials
Ingredient Selection and Formulation
Base Ingredients: Cowpea leaf powder, Orange Flesh Sweet Potato (OFSP) flour,
maize flour, and selected spices.
Functional Additives: MSG, Mono- and Di-Glycerides of Fatty Acids, Whey Protein,
and Caramel were purchased from suppliers around Kampala and Nairobi
Fortificants: to improve iron and zinc bioavailability were purchased from suppliers
around Kampala such as Wami Quality Chemicals, Wandegeya.
3.2 Preparation of cowpea leaves grits.
Fresh cowpea leaves were plucked and washed with clean running water. The water
was drained, and cowpea leaves were blanched and dried in an air-conventional
dryer at 65°C for 6 hours at the National Agricultural Research Laboratories Kawanda
FBA Incubation Centre. After drying, the pieces were allowed to cool and milled into
powder and stored a in polythene packet at room temperature.
3.3 Preparation of orange-fleshed sweet potato (OFSP) flour
OFSP tubers were washed with clean water to remove soil and dirt, peeled using a
kitchen knife, chopped to about 0.2-0.4 cm width, 2-5 cm length, and 0.1-0.3 cm
thick, and dried in an air conventional dryer at 65 ̊C for 48 h. The dried chips were
milled into powder to pass through a 0.5 mm mesh screen and then stored in a
polythene packet at room temperature.

3.4 Extrusion Cooking Technology
The formulations were extruded using a single screw extruder at Food Bioscience
and Agribusiness incubation center powered by a 7.5 HP motor (Model So sejin). The
extruder's barrel had a diameter of 19 mm, and after the feeding section, the barrel
temperature was maintained at 150oC. The extruder was operated at a temperature
of 180oC, the main screw speed of 1450 rpm, and the knife motor speed of 150 rpm,
and the cooked product was forced through a round-shaped die. The cooking
temperatures were controlled using an automatic cooler and monitored using an
infrared thermometer. When the die pressure and screw speed were constant,
extrudates emerging from the die were collected and allowed to stand for 30
minutes on a cooling conveyor to aid sufficient cooling. The cool extrudates were
then milled in a hammer mill, and mounted with a 0.5 mm screen to obtain the
instant flour. The instant flour was packaged into sealed plastic HDPE Ziploc bags
and stored at ambient temperature, in a cool dry place.
3.5 Proximate Composition
The proximate composition including dry matter, ash content, crude protein of the
instant soup was determined according to the Association of Official Analytical
Chemists (AOAC), (2005). The results were presented as an average of duplicate
determinations. The protein content (CP) was determined by protocol Adopted from
AOAC Method 978.02, 16th Ed. Using the Kjeldahl apparatus, A factor of 6.25 was
used to convert from total nitrogen to CP (%).Dry matter was determined by oven
drying method 925.10 (AOAC, 2005)
3.6 Mineral composition (Zinc, Iron, Calcium)
The mineral content of samples was determined according to Schroeder et al.
(2015), using a Bruker S1 TURBO hand-held XRF analyzer with a silicon drift detector
that operated at 45 kV and 30 mA, with a Ti/Al filter. The XRF spectrometer was
controlled via a Hewlett Packard PDA using XBruker Elemental S1 software with a
resolution was approximately 145 eV at 200,000 cps. Three SRM samples (0.80
g/sample) were analyzed thrice each for 30 seconds. The sample cup was put on a
safety platform mounted to the instrument's tip to guarantee equal distance for
analysis. The data obtained was in parts per million (PPM).


3.7 Sensory Evaluation
A panel of 60 untrained panelist with an average age of 20 ± 8.2 was evaluate the
samples based on flavor, texture, color, and overall acceptability using a descriptive
analysis or hedonic scale.
Purposive sampling was employed as the sampling approach, and panelists were
chosen based on their availability, willingness to participate, and consumption of
cowpea vegetables. The samples were distributed to the panelists using a research
randomizer, which distributes the treatments among the panelists so that each is
repeated the same number of times, and each treatment appears precisely once in
each row and column in the design, reducing Systemic error. A complete randomized
design (CRD) was applied that indicated samples were distributed to the panelists
randomly.
Panelists were asked to provide their honest judgments after tasting the instant
cowpea leaves based product. Each participant was asked verbally to agree to
participate and to disclose any allergies they might have to any of the processed
food items.
3.8 Cooking procedures of soup powders and Consumer Acceptability Tests
The instant soup was prepared using 200 grams of instant cowpea soup and salt (2g)
then added into 1500 ml hot water and boiled for 5 min (to pasteurize) ready for
evaluation. Appearance, color, aroma, flavor, texture (mouth feel), taste, and
overall acceptability of the sensory qualities were assessed using a 9-point Hedonic
scale, (1= "I extremely dislike it" and 9 being "I enjoy it extremely"). The following
items were given to each panelist: serviettes, 5 samples of the instant soup, and
water to rinse the palate before and after testing the samples. The test used 200 ml
disposable white cups containing 40–50 ml of instant soup. Sensory evaluation was
conducted in sensory booths that separated the panelists; one sample was given to
the panelists at a time. The different samples were assigned three-digit codes.
Statistical Analysis
All data collected from the survey was expressed as means and standard deviation
(SD) for the individual nutrient. All the nutritional and sensory analyses were
performed in triplicate, and data were analyzed using EXCELSTAT version


2012.10.7.01 Addinsoft, Paris France). The statistically significant difference was
stated at p < 0.05.

CHAPTER FIVE
5.0 Discussion of Results
Table 1.
There were no statistically significant differences found for any of the minerals (all
p-values > 0.05).
Treatment B had higher Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc levels while treatment A had
higher Potassium, Sulfur, Iron, and Copper levels.
The zinc content in Sample B was notably higher, though not statistically significant
(p = 0.107) which was attributed to the fortificant used. However, the levels of
fortificants were not high enough to create a significant difference due to maximum
levels allowed according to US_EAS_786_2019 standard
Table 2.
The B samples generally had the highest mean scores across most sensory attributes.
The A07 sample consistently had the lowest scores, especially in mouthfeel (5.41)
and aroma (5.74) which indicates a slight preference for fortified samples and other
A samples over A07.
The high standard deviations across all groups indicate wide variation in individual
responses, making it harder to detect significant differences.
No statistically significant differences were found between treatment groups for any
sensory attribute (p > 0.05). While fortified samples (B) scored slightly higher, the
differences were not strong enough to be considered meaningful statistically.
The color of the soup is not ideally representative of common soups on the market.
Cowpea leaf powder was common to these two soup formulations and so contained
chlorophyll pigments that imparted a dark green color to the soup, and the intensity
of the green color increased as the concentration of composite mixes increased in
the formulations to 10% and then 15%(Mungofa & Beswa, 2024)





Table 3
Group A (Base Treatment):
Minimal processing and no protein additives were used thus lower protein suggests
no whey fortification.
Group B (Additives Pre-Extrusion):
This contained whey protein, MSG, colorants, and fortificants added before
extrusion.
During extrusion, whey protein was exposed to high heat (120–185°C), causing
partial denaturation and reduced solubility thus may explain the moderate protein
retention compared to A07.
Group A07 (Additives Post-Extrusion):
Whey protein was added after extrusion, avoiding heat-induced denaturation. This
preserved protein integrity and functionality, leading to higher measurable protein
content. Whey protein is highly sensitive to heat, especially during extrusion:
Denaturation: At temperatures above 70°C, whey proteins (e.g., β-lactoglobulin)
unfold, losing solubility and forming gels.
Extrusion Challenges: Pre-extrusion whey addition (Group B) risks over-browning,
dense texture, and reduced solubility due to prolonged heat exposure.
Post-Extrusion Advantage: Adding whey post-extrusion (A07) bypasses these issues,
preserving protein quality and boosting measurable content.
Moisture Stability
All groups show similar moisture levels (~4.1–4.4%).
Extrusion parameters (e.g., controlled water flow) and formula adjustments likely
stabilized moisture, preventing fungal/bacterial growth.






5.1 Conclusions.
The use of selected additives did not serve the purpose of improving the soup quality.
For biofortification to be effective, it must align with consumer preferences. Studies
underscore the importance of sensory evaluation in determining the acceptability of
biofortified products (Mbwana et al., 2021).
5.2 Recommendations.
Investigate the use of additives at higher levels according to good manufacturing
practices (GMPs) to enhance sensory characteristics further in B samples to create a
clearer distinction.
The use of a larger sample size or a more focused sensory panel (e.g., trained
panelists) to reduce variability and detect precise differences.
The additives may be beneficial, but their levels need to be optimized to determine
the levels that give the best outcome. This should be coupled with a cost benefit
analysis to ensure benefits outweigh costs.
