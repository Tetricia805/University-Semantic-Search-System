CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining)
is a widely used methodology that provides a framework for
conducting data mining projects. It outlines a series of phases
that guide the process from business understanding to
deployment.
Documentation: Maintain clear documentation throughout the
project.

Phases of CRISP-DM:
1. Business Understanding:
❑Define the business objectives and goals.
❑Identify the relevant data sources.
❑Create a project plan.
2. Data Understanding:
❑Collect and gather the necessary data.
❑Explore the data to understand its characteristics, quality, and
completeness.
❑Identify potential data quality issues.

3. Data Preparation:
❑Clean and preprocess the data to address any quality issues.
❑Transform the data into a suitable format for analysis.
❑Create features or attributes that are relevant to the problem.
4. Modeling:
❑Select appropriate data mining techniques based on the business
objectives.
❑Build and train models using the prepared data.
❑Evaluate the performance of the models.

5. Evaluation:
❑Assess the quality and reliability of the models.
❑Compare the performance of different models.
❑Validate the models using unseen data.
6. Deployment:
❑Integrate the chosen model into the production environment.
❑Monitor the model's performance and update it as needed.

Data exploration and visualisation
In data mining, exploration helps an analyst understand the
data, identify patterns, and communicate findings effectively.
Handles various aspects such as;
Summary Statistics: Calculate measures like mean, median, mode, standard deviation,
and percentiles to get a basic understanding of the data distribution.
Data Profiling: Examine data types, missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
Univariate Analysis: Analyze individual variables to understand their distributions and
characteristics.

Data exploration and visualisation
Handles various aspects such as;
Bivariate Analysis: Examine relationships between pairs of variables.
Multivariate Analysis: Explore relationships among multiple variables.
Data Storytelling: Use visualizations to create compelling narratives and
communicate insights effectively.

Association rule mining
●This technique discovers interesting relationships between
items in a large dataset. These relationships, typically
represented as rules, can be used to make predictions or
recommendations.
●The technique uses unsupervised machine learning
algorithms to find the hidden rules (associations) in data
●Association rule mining assigns key statistical parameters that
are different from correlations (i.e. Support, Lift, Confidence)

1. Support
Support is a measure of how frequent a item or an item set appears in a
dataset. For example, what is the support for the item set { Milk + Cheese }
everytime a customer goes to a shop?

2. Confidence
Confidence is a measure of how often this rule is found to be true. Or the
probability that an event will occur given that another event has occurred.
So what is the probability that a customer who purchases milk will also
purchase cheese?

3. Lift
Lift defines that strength of the relationship or association of purchasing
milk and cheese

1. Apriori algorithm
●The Apriori Algorithm searches through small datasets to identify
different rules(associations). In this algorithm, there are product clusters
that pass frequently, and then strong relationships between these
products and other products are sought.
●It's designed to efficiently discover frequent itemsets and association
rules in small datasets.
Association rule: A rule of the form X → Y, where X and Y are itemsets. X is called the antecedent,
and Y is called the consequent.
Support: The fraction of transactions that contain both X and Y.
Confidence: The probability that Y will occur given that X has occurred.

2. FP-Growth algorithm
●The frequent pattern growth algorithm also uses unsupervised
learning but is more efficient than apriori algorithm
●The algorithm uses a divide-and-conquer approach to generate
frequent itemsets efficiently. The main idea of the FP-growth
algorithm is to represent the dataset in a compact form called the
frequent pattern tree
●Limited to categorical data only.

3. ECLAT algorithm
●Equivalence Class Clustering and List Intersection offers a more
efficient approach compared to Apriori, especially for dense
datasets.
Key Concepts:
●Equivalence class: A group of items that always appear together in
transactions.
●Item prefix: The initial part of an itemset.
●Item list: A list of transactions that contain a specific item.

Applications of association mining
Market basket analysis: Identifying products that are frequently purchased
together.
Recommendation systems: Suggesting items to users based on their past
purchases or preferences.
Web usage mining: Analyzing user behavior on a website to improve its
design.
Medical diagnosis: Identifying patterns in patient data to assist in
diagnosis.
