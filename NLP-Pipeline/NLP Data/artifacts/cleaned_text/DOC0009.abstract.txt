The study assessed the impact of teenage pregnancy on family stability in Bubaare
Sub-County, Rubanda District. The objectives of the study were; to investigate the
causes of teenage pregnancy among teenagers in Bubaare Sub-County, to assess the
effects of teenage pregnancy on family stability in Bubaare Sub-County and to
identify coping strategies families use to deal with the challenges posed by teenage
pregnancy in Bubaare Sub-County. A qualitative research approach was used and
data was collected using interviews and questionnaires. The study findings on causes
of teenage pregnancy among teenagers in Bubaare Sub-County were; peer pressure
contributes to teenage pregnancy, lack of sex education leads to teenage pregnancy,
poverty drives many teens into early sexual activity. The study findings on effects
of teenage pregnancy on family stability in Bubaare Sub-County were; teenage
pregnancy increases economic burden on families, teenage pregnancy leads to
school dropout. The study findings on coping strategies families use to deal with the
challenges posed by teenage pregnancy in Bubaare Sub-County were; families seek
counseling services to handle teenage pregnancies. It was suggested in this research
that policymakers create and introduce comprehensive sexuality education policies
that are culturally sensitive as well as age-appropriate to manage the core causes
of adolescent pregnancy.
In summary, research unveiled that adolescent pregnancy impacts family stability in
Rubanda District's Bubaare Sub-County considerably through added economic
pressures, emotional distress, school dropouts, inter-family disagreements, and
damage to reputation. The research identified significant contributing factors as
peer pressure, poverty, absence of sexual education, fragmented households, as
well as media influence. Families counter these through seeking counseling,

enlisting religious leaders' involvement, aid from extended family members,
education priority on the adolescent mother's part, as well as in a few instances
through early marriage.

CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION
1.1 Introduction
Adolescent pregnancy remains a common experience worldwide, impacting
individuals, families, and communities. Adolescent pregnancy disrupts the usual
development of young individuals towards becoming adults and thus leads to
economic hardship, emotional distress, and social stigma. Teenage motherhood
families may face substantial disruption, particularly among rural societies with
socioeconomic circumstances like Bubaare Sub-County, Rubanda District. Taking into
consideration the cause, effect, and adaptations of the affected families, this
research aimed at assessing the impact of teenage pregnancy on family stability.
1.2 Background of the Study
1.2.1 Historical Background
Teenage pregnancy is socio-economical and public health issue for a long time,
mainly due to the gendered, cultural and economic dynamics that are historical to
it. The childbearing of adolescents has been a phenomenon that has left a mark on
the underprivileged people throughout the world and it has been most common in
low and middle-income countries. The international organizations, among them the
United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the World Health Organization (WHO),
have acknowledged the continuous rise of teenage pregnancies over the years,
especially in the areas where access to economic, medical, and educational
opportunities is very limited (UNFPA, 2021). Teenage pregnancy has caused many
problems in family life in South America which has been mostly due to poverty,
cultural expectations, and limited access to education (Del Mastro, 2023). In the

past, having a child at a young age was acceptable in extended family settings but
the coming of colonizers brought strict religious beliefs that condemned pregnancy
outside marriage. The growing urbanization and widening economic gap during the
20th century saw a rise in adolescent pregnancies particularly in the poorer areas.
These pregnancies were one of the factors that led to unstable family structures as
they cut off people's economic and educational prospects. The problems of poverty,
gender inequality, and weak enforcement of policies are still prevalent even though
there are today's fertility health initiatives (Smith & Sinkford, 2022). Hence, teenage
pregnancy continues to put a strain on families by keeping the cycles of dependency
and low social mobility alive. In the past, teenage pregnancy had been more
prevalent in countries with traditional customs and gender norms that promoted
early marriage and little female autonomy. These customs have been able to survive
in Sub-Saharan Africa where they are the ones with the most pronounced impact on
the issue of teenage pregnancy. In Uganda, although population control and
education programs have changed over time, the rate of teenage pregnancies has
not been completely reduced. Uganda continues to have one of the highest rates of
teenage pregnancies worldwide, according to the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS,
2022). Teenage pregnancy is a persistent issue with deep historical roots that has
not yet been adequately addressed by policy or practice in rural areas like Western
Uganda, where poverty and traditional values are prevalent. Teenage pregnancy is
still a significant problem in Bubaare Sub-county, Rubanda District, where poverty
and traditional beliefs are still prevalent.

1.2.2 Theoretical Background
The Ecological Systems Theory (Bronfenbrenner, 1979) and the Strain Theory
(Merton, 1938) served as the study's guiding theories.
Ecological Systems Theory
According to Bronfenbrenner's Ecological Systems Theory, which was developed in
1979, human development is impacted by many environmental system levels that
interact with a person's biological potential to shape experiences and behavior
(Bronfenbrenner, 1979). The microsystem, mesosystem, exosystem, macrosystem,
and chronosystem are the five interconnected systems described in the theory.
Through their connections with peers, family, the community, and societal
institutions, these systems together impact a person's development (Neal & Neal,
2019).
Human development takes place inside nested environmental structures, and
interactions between these systems continuously influence an individual's
development, according to the Ecological Systems Theory's underlying presumptions.
Another presumption is that people are impacted by their immediate and extended
contexts rather than developing independently. Additionally, according to the idea,
development is a lively process, and the duration of the changes like the stability of
the family or the financial steady can greatly affect the outcomes of one's life
(Tudge, 2019). This theory has something in common with the study examining the
effects of teenage pregnancy on family stability in Bubaare Sub-County, as it points
to the environmental factors that lead to it and the afterward impacts on families.
At the microsystem level, the support or lack thereof from family may determine

how a young woman will cope with her pregnancy. The teenager's along with
education or support seeking capacity is determined by the mesosystem, which
consists of the home, school, and community interactions. The financial
management of young pregnancy strains by families is determined by the exosystem
comprising factors like parents' employment status and local economic stability
(Bronfenbrenner, 2005). At the macrosystem level, family reactions and the overall
stability of the home depend on the coming of an early pregnancy; in such cases,
cultural and societal conventions that dictate the roles of the genders and marriage
greatly influence these reactions. Besides, the historical and life transitions, such as
changes in socioeconomic conditions or policy regarding youth reproductive health,
affect the trend of teenage pregnancy and family adaptability (Darling, 2020). The
proposed framework allows the researcher to systematically assess the multiple
factors that lead to teenage pregnancy and their interactions with family stability
in Bubaare Sub-County. Strain Theory Robert K. Merton, a sociologist, developed the
Strain Theory in 1938. He provides a model that helps to explain the impact of social
factors on deviant behavior. The idea is that people are compelled to go for different
means to reach their ends when the society's virtue is blocked to them.
1.2.3 Conceptual Background
Teenage pregnancy is the term used to describe the pregnancy of a girl who is still
in her teens, specifically between the ages of 10 and 19. The present research
considers teenage pregnancy an issue that is rich in factors and henceforth it is
acknowledged not only as a reproductive health problem but also as having
socioeconomic and psychological implications. The primary aspects being discussed
are the interlinked repercussions of teenage pregnancy which include, among

others, early sexual initiation the cycle of unplanned pregnancies, school dropouts
and family disintegration.
Family stability in this regard means the capacity of a family to keep up functional
relationships, emotional support networks and economic viability. Especially in the
case of Rubanda district where resources are quite limited, teenage pregnancy
disturbs family stability by Introducing unanticipated caregiving responsibilities,
financial burden, and social stigma. However, families after an case of teenage
pregnancy soon experience emotional strain, intergenerational conflict, and
breakdown (Banke-Thomas et al., 2020).
Moreover, one of the most crucial conceptual pillars is access to reproductive health
information and services. In most cases, young individuals living in rural regions are
not provided with complete sexual education, which results in wrong sexual behavior
decisions. If such teenagers lack proper support and information, they are at a higher
risk of engaging in unprotected sex and getting pregnant accidentally (Habumugisha
et al., 2021). The last but not the least is the concept of social support networks
that plays an important role in mitigating the consequences of teenage pregnancy.
The mentioned support systems may include schools, hospitals, peers, religious
places, and NGOs. The availability and accessibility of such services have a
significant impact on whether young mothers will be able to continue their
education, access healthcare or get integrated back into their community.

1.2.4 Contextual Background
Teenage pregnancy is still a significant challenge to the growth and development of
Uganda. According to UBOS (2022), one-fourth of girls aged 15 to 19 years in the
country are already pregnant or have gone through childbirth at least once. One of
the most affected areas is Western Uganda's rural areas where the aforementioned
factors coupled with high poverty and illiteracy levels continue to prevail. Bubaare
Sub-County, located in the Rubanda District, is one such area where these
nationwide trends can be clearly seen. It is a place that can be characterized by low
educational levels, extreme poverty, and strong gender stereotypes.
The health centers in the area are reporting increased teenage births based on
anecdotal and observational evidence. Among the reasons for this change, that the
de facto parents are not taking care of their kids, the economic situation is difficult,
and the kids are not taught about sex. Girls who become pregnant are often reported
as being stigmatized socially and, as a result, are expelled from schools and are
sometimes forced to rely on their older partners or families. The government and
NGOs have been providing youth-friendly health services and community trainings as
part of a strategy to reduce cases of teenage pregnancies in Bubaare.
However, these actions have not reduced the number of pregnancies among
teenagers appreciably indicating that more serious structural issues might be at
play. Muwonge et al. (2020) identify these as deep-rooted poverty, lack of job
opportunities for the youth, and weak enforcement of child protection laws. Societal
and familial factors surrounding teenage pregnancy need an urgent investigation,
since it is still very much a crime against family structures in the Rubanda District.

This research was designed to assess the impact of teenage pregnancy on family
stability in Bubaare Sub-County.
1.3 Problem Statement
Teenage pregnancy is an issue of great concern for the public health and socioeconomic aspects all over the world, especially in the low- and middle-income
countries where the majority of teenage girls are prone to vulnerability. As per the
United Nations Population Fund's assessment (UNFPA, 2021), there are around 16
million births every year to girls in the age group of 15-19, with Sub-Saharan Africa
being the most affected, that is, experiencing the highest rates of teenage births
due to factors like poverty, cultural beliefs, and practices like early marriages, and
low access to reproductive health services. East Africa, Kenya, Tanzania, and
Uganda are some of the areas that continue to report teenage pregnancy as a major
concern, which in turn has a negative impact on maternal health, makes it difficult
for girls to stay in school, and leads to instability in family life. In Uganda, according
to the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS, 2022), one-fourth of girls in the teenage
age group have had their first child at the most, which is even more in the western
region, 27%, thus, making it apparent that rural areas have a larger population of
these girls who are more vulnerable. In the Rubanda District, and specifically in the
Bubaare Sub-County, teenage pregnancy is an issue that community development
and family stability are at risk of being threatened by. The trouble is mainly for girls
who are 13-19 years old and from very poor rural backgrounds that hardly access
educational and health services. The outcomes are school dropout, early marriage,
reliance on parents, mental distress, and the family system getting more strained.
School dropout, early marriages, economic dependence, psychological distress, and

increased strain on extended family systems are just a few of the negative
consequences of teenage pregnancy. Still, the methods used for government and
NGO interventions such as reproductive health education and youth-friendly services
have so far failed to bring down teenage pregnancy rates in rural Bubaare. This can
be interpreted as either the existing strategies being ineffective, lacking in
accessibility, or not being culturally sensitive. The problem is also shaped by parents'
and teens'
1.4 Objectives of the Study
1.4.1 General Objective
To investigate teenage pregnancy on family stability in Bubaare Sub-County,
Rubanda District
1.4.2 Specific Objectives
1. To investigate the causes of teenage pregnancy among teenagers in Bubaare Sub-
County.
2. To assess the effects of teenage pregnancy on family stability in Bubaare Sub-
County.
3. To identify coping strategies families use to deal with the challenges posed by
teenage pregnancy in Bubaare Sub-County.
1.5 Research Questions
1. What are the causes of teenage pregnancy among teenagers in Bubaare Sub-
County?
2. How does teenage pregnancy affect family stability in Bubaare Sub-County?

3. What coping strategies can families adopt to manage the challenges of teenage
pregnancy?
1.6 Scope of the Study
1.6.1 Geographical Scope
The study was conducted in Bubaare Sub-County, Rubanda District, a rural area with
a high prevalence of teenage pregnancy. The district borders with Kisoro to the west,
Rukungiri and Kanungu to the north, Kabale to the East, and the Republic of Rwanda
to the south. Rubanda District lies on the main highway from Kabale to Kisoro,
connecting to Rwanda and DRC. Rubanda District was curved out of Kabale following
the Act of Parliament of 3rd September 2015 and it became operational on 1 July
2016. The area was chosen because of the high rate of cases of teenage pregnancies
which have been reported to the in the sub county. In Bubaare Sub County, the
majority of men and women have finished basic school, while a small percentage
have graduated from senior four, senior six, and tertiary institutions, respectively
(Mukiza, 2020). The majority's low educational attainment prevents them from
having formal employment opportunities. Because they are unable to provide for all
of the family's fundamental necessities, they have turned to low-paying, informal
work, which exposes many to unnecessary behavior.
1.6.2 Content Scope
The scope of the content of this study was limited to the investigation of the issue
of teenage pregnancy in Bubaare Sub-County, intending to uncover its underlying
causes, how it impacts family stability, and the coping mechanisms employed by the
families concerned. More precisely, the study aims to investigate the reasons of the

adolescent pregnancies in the locality, to evaluate the impact of such pregnancies
on the family stability and functioning, and to discover the different means through
which these families manage andget past the difficulties connected with them.
1.6.3 Time Scope
The study examined teenage pregnancy trends and their impact on family stability
within the last five years (2019–2024) to provide relevant and up-to-date data.
1.7 Significance of the Study
Policymakers
The potential impact of the research on the social and health aspects of teenage
pregnancy in rural areas is very significant. In addition, the information derived from
the study will not only be a basis but also help activate the progressive policies and
the like social supportive measures that would contribute to the overall health and
growth of the society. Healthcare Providers the research will probably cover a wide
range of aspects including the psychological, reproductive, and general health needs
of adolescents mothers.
This possibly would be one way towards the setting up and operating of health
services that is said to be youth-friendly and that concerns issues such as counseling
and education on reproductive health for teenagers. Community Leaders and Local
Government The research is likely to specifically offer a model for community-based
methods and awareness campaigns. Community leaders will be able to advocate for
changes in culture and behavior through informed by social factors that lead to
teenage pregnancies being identified and their actions that are guided by advocacy
and local actions. Families and Community Members The research can possibly

suggest coping strategies and approaches to support that families can adopt. This
could be a situation where the emotional, financial, and social aspects attached to
teenage pregnancy are handled which in turn allows the affected families to be more
resilient and have better quality of life.
Researchers and Academics
Not only the literature is unmasked by the study but also it is pointed out as a
reference for subsequent researchers investigating comparable problems. The work
done here might ultimately trigger more research in the sphere of rural
reproductive health, family dynamics, and youth development. The conceptual
framework underpinning this study utilizes socio-ecological model, which explores
the influences of individual, family, community, and societal factors on teenage
pregnancy and family stability.

1.8 Conceptual framework

Narrative of the conceptual framework
The reasons behind teenage pregnancy, which include the absence of comprehensive
sex education, peer pressure, early sexual activity, and restricted access to
contraceptives, have a direct effect on the reproductive choices of teenagers.
Nevertheless, these reasons do not work separately; they are influenced and
intermixed by the factors of the economy, culture, and policy. Poverty and lack of
education, for instance, can lead one to become pregnant at a very young age, while
cultural practices such as the acceptance of early marriages or the prohibition of

contraceptives might make the issue worse. Moreover, poor execution of
reproductive health education policies and no youth-friendly health services may
prevent the adoption of preventive strategies.
Together, these intervening variables determine the extent of the long-term impact
of teenage pregnancy on family stability, which then, as one of the sources of
financial strain, affects the economic, emotional, and social well-being of the
family. Thus, a holistic approach that acknowledges these broader systemic
influences as well as the promotion of stability and resilience in the affected families
is required to tackle the issue of teenage pregnancy.

CHAPTER TWO: LITERATURE REVIEW
2.1 Introduction
Globally, teenage pregnancy is still a major social and public health concern,
especially in low-income areas where socioeconomic and cultural factors play a role
in its incidence. Teenager pregnancy has effects on families, communities, and the
advancement of the country in addition to the individual. This chapter reviews
existing literature related to teenage pregnancy and its impact on family stability in
Bubaare
Sub-County,
Rubanda
District.
The review
includes
theoretical
perspectives, key conceptual discussions, empirical evidence on the causes and
effects of teenage pregnancy on family stability, coping strategies employed by
families, research gaps, and a conclusion.
2.2 Theoretical Review
The Ecological Systems Theory (Bronfenbrenner, 1979) and the Strain Theory
(Merton, 1938) served as the study's guiding theories.
2.2.1 Ecological Systems Theory
According to Bronfenbrenner's Ecological Systems Theory, which was established in
1979, human development is a result of the interplay of various environmental
system levels that interact with the individual's biological potential so that the
person's experiences and behavior are literally shaped (Bronfenbrenner, 1979). The
model consists of five systems that are interconnected: microsystem, mesosystem,
exosystem, macrosystem, and chronosystem. Each system in turn influences the
development of an individual through the interactions of the individual with their
peers, family, community, and societal institutions (Neal & Neal, 2019).

The Ecological Systems Theory is based on the idea that human development unfolds
in an environment that consists of different levels and that the interactions played
out among these systems constantly affect the individual's development. A person is
viewed as being affected by both the immediate and extended environments and
not as developing in a vacuum. The theory also postulates that development is
dynamic, meaning that changes over time such as variations in family stability or
income can significantly alter a person's life outcomes (Tudge, 2019). This theory
not only points out the connection between the environmental factors coming to the
pregnancy of a young girl and their impacts on her family, but also echoes the study
about the influence of teenage pregnancy on family stability in Bubaare Sub-County.
The manner in which a young girl copes with her pregnancy may be greatly
dependent on the presence or absence of family support at the microsystem level.
The young girl's ability to continue her studies or to look for support networks is
determined by the ecosystem comprising of the home, school, and neighborhood
interactions. To what extent families are capable of coping with the financial
burdens of a teenage pregnancy.
2.2.2 Strain Theory
Overview Sociologist Robert K. Merton developed Merton's Strain Theory in 1938. It
provides a method for understanding how social elements affect abnormal
behaviors. The theory asserts that people are pushed to seek other ways of attaining
the missed legal methods of success such as risky or criminal activities by social
pressures and lack of access to legal means of success (Agnew, 2019). Among these
outcomes, early sexual engagement and teenage pregnancies are the most common,

particularly for teens living in poverty-stricken areas. The core concept of Merton's
Strain Theory states that although society communicates the need for certain things
like financial well-being and stability, not everyone has the same rights to access
the legal means of achieving them. Some people, however, use drugs, crime, and
vice to succeed due to the stress and anomie their circumstances cause (Agnew,
2019). Merton has classified the ways of coping with stress into five categories:
conformity—where one abides by the social norms and goals; innovation—the means
to success are through illegal activities; ritualism—the norms are abandoned while
the customs are still followed; retreatism—the rejection of norms and means both;
and finally, rebellion—striving to overthrow the present social order and replace it
with a new one (Passas & Agnew, 2020). The Strain Theory is good for studying
socioeconomic problems and deviance even as these adaptations explain the variety
in deviant behavior and the social reactions to inequality. Merton's Strain Theory
indicates that the cultural expectations, limited educational opportunities, and
financial strain could all contribute to stress caused by the issue of teenage
pregnancy in the case of low-income communities, especially the teenagers (Bunting
et al., 2020; Madkour et al., 2021).
2.3 Empirical Review
2.3.1 Causes of Teenage Pregnancy among Teenagers
Poverty and financial difficulties are the leading factors that result in teenage
pregnancy. Economic insecurity is one of the reasons why many teenage girls end up
engaging in transactional sex, which is exchanging sex for money or basic needs like
food and other essentials (UNFPA, 2020). Many teenage females in places like Bubare
Sub-County are driven to seek financial support by marrying young or through

relationships with older men because of the lack of job opportunities and poverty in
the families. Poverty is a very strong factor to preterm birth but no studies have yet
investigated the direct impact of such economic vulnerabilities on the stability of
families, especially in rural areas of Uganda. By looking into the issue, the researcher
aims to fill the gap by investigating how pregnancies caused by poverty affect the
relationships of parents, the resources of the family, and the family responsibilities
in Bubare Sub-County. The lack of access to comprehensive sexual and reproductive
health education is another vital factor that contributes to this issue. Many young
people are still not well-informed about STIs, contraceptives, and the negative
consequences of getting pregnant very young. This lack of knowledge increases the
risk of unplanned pregnancies and sexual acts without protection (Guttmacher
Institute, 2021).
Despite the fact that this educational gap has been highlighted by previous studies,
there are hardly any that have investigated the effects of this ignorance on the
teenage girl and the family as a whole, which includes stress, increased dependency,
and social stigma. Moreover, teenage pregnancy is significantly accelerated by
cultural and religious practices. In Uganda and some other African countries, early
marriage and childbearing are often promoted as a way of preserving family honor,
lineage, and cultural practices (Mugisha & Mugisa, 2021).
Early sexual activity and childbearing are encouraged by cultural views that define
a woman's worth via motherhood, which can limit girls' access to education and
employment prospects. However, little empirical study has been done to determine
how these cultural factors interact with family structures and whether they
strengthen or impair family stability when early motherhood occurs.

Teenage pregnancy is also caused by media exposure and peer pressure. Teenagers
frequently copy the actions of their friends or celebrities, particularly when those
actions are presented as contemporary or socially acceptable (Kalule & Ochen,
2019). Teenagers may engage in dangerous sexual conduct to fit in due to peer
pressure, and media outlets usually glorify sexual relationships without emphasizing
the negative effects. However, the impact of peer and media-driven pregnancies on
home stability whether through interrupted education, strained parent-child
relationships, or financial strains is not adequately examined in the literature
currently in publication.
Another important factor is family background, especially dysfunctional family
settings. Teenagers from households where there is parental abuse, neglect, or
absence frequently don't receive the right kind of emotional support and direction
(Ninsiima et al., 2020). These teenagers are more likely to engage in early sexual
activity and become pregnant if they go to other sources for affection or financial
support. Although the overall literature acknowledges these dynamics, local
research on the ways in which teenager pregnancies from broken households lead to
long-term instability within extended families particularly in rural communities like
Bubare Sub-County are lacking.
Additionally, one underappreciated factor contributing to teenager pregnancy is the
lack of access to youth-friendly health services. In the rural parts of Uganda, the
youngsters do not go for sexual and reproductive health treatments due to the
unavailability of teenager-centered care, skilled personnel, and privacy at many
health facilities. The likelihood of unwanted pregnancies for girls increases if they
are completely cut off from counseling and contraceptive services.

The trickle-down effect of this gap in the system has been widely acknowledged
(WHO, 2022), although its impact on family stability through increased caring
responsibilities, financial pressure, and intergenerational disputes is not well
documented. This research will investigate the overlooked repercussions on families
due to teenage pregnancy in Bubare Sub-County.
2.3.2 Effects of Teenage Pregnancy on Family Stability
One of the major impacts of teenage pregnancy is the financial pressure it puts on
families. Typically, teenage mothers do not have enough money to take care of
themselves and their infants and always rely on their parents. Thus, the families are
left to handle the expenses for baby-sitting, food, clothes, and even medical care.
This financial burden could push households in so-called 'resource-constrained' areas
like Bubare Sub-County deeper into poverty since poverty rates in such regions are
already high. Teenage pregnancy leads to increased household expenditure, which
in turn reduces the family's capability to support the welfare and education of other
children (UNICEF, 2021). On top of this, there is still no local research about the
economic pressure that young parentage would cause in rural communities of
southwestern Uganda, as most of the studies on this issue focus on urban or national
settings.
Emotional and Psychological Distress
A study that was recently published, showed that more often than not families of
teen mothers go through emotional and psychological hardships. The parents might
feel the whole spectrum of emotions like anxiety, shame, or disappointment,
especially in places where teen pregnancy is socially unacceptable. These negative

feelings could even lead to social withdrawal, poor communication between the
parents and the child, and conflicts among the family members (Kagimu, Sekiwunga,
& Atuhaire, 2021).
Being stigmatized further aggravates the already existing emotional difficulties,
thus, ironically, the communities that are affected by teenage pregnancy do not get
to enjoy their rights under the law. Still, only a handful of studies have been
conducted on the impact of emotional turmoil on the parenting styles and family
cohesion in rural Uganda. Besides, by revealing the emotional burden and mental
pressure that teenage pregnancy inflicts on families in Bubare Sub-County, the
earlier reference underscored an area that needs more exploration. Delineation of
Family Roles and Responsibilities Teenage pregnancies quite often result in
alterations within family structure, that is, similar to the case when a pregnant
teenager had to take over the mother’s duties. A change in family dynamics can also
be brought about through sibling neglect or siblings being forced to assist in raising
the child, with the grandparents possibly having to co-parent the grandchildren.
Families might face a variety of issues such as disagreement, anxiety, and bitterness
due to these sudden changes in roles (Nabukalu, Lwanga, & Tumwine, 2019). Such
role disturbances are often neither well-studied nor reflected in policy responses.
Yet, the fact that the research of Nabukalu, Lwanga, and Tumwine (2019) did not
show how the reassignments caused by teenage pregnancy impact the long-term
household harmony and stability in Bubare Sub-County, contributes to the existing
research gap.

Educational Disruption and Intergenerational Poverty
In Uganda, one of the main reasons why females drop out of school is teenage
pregnancy. Due to their inability to manage parenthood and study, many young
women are compelled to drop out of school (MoES, 2020). This results in fewer work
options and a lifetime of reliance on family or low-wage informal labor. A cycle of
poverty that impacts the teenager mother and her extended family is the long-term
effect. There is a dearth of precise data demonstrating how teenager mothers'
disruption of their education affects family ambitions, production, and long-term
stability in rural regions like Rubanda, despite national reports indicating this
tendency. This study will look at how early pregnancy-related school dropouts
impact the socioeconomic trajectory of families in Bubare Sub-County.
Limited Social Support Systems
Another underestimated impact of teenage pregnancy is the lack or insufficiency of
official and informal support networks for impacted families. There are nongovernmental organizations that offer interventions in urban areas, but usually,
these services are non-existent in the countryside. Psychosocial and financial
support are not available and thus families have to manage the complicated realities
of teenage pregnancy (Gahongayire et al., 2022). This situation creates wider
dysfunction within the family as it increases feelings of helplessness and isolation.
Even though the issue of teenage reproductive health is gaining more national
attention, there is no research-based evidence that support networks in Rubanda
District are available and effective in preventing family separation.

2.3.3 Coping Strategies Families Use to Deal with Challenges of Teenage
Pregnancy
When faced with teenager pregnancy, families frequently seek support from
community organizations, religious communities, and extended family members.
These social networks offer practical, financial, and emotional support, which can
lessen the strain on the family. Support from informal networks is a very important
part of life for many families in the community facing the burden of prettifying a
teenager (Muwonge et al., 2021).
There are still some families that are ready to sacrifice just about everything to
keep their daughters in school so that they can get a decent job after the birth.
They may push their daughters to go back to school or take vocational training as a
way to increase their chances of getting a steady job after the birth. Usually, these
activities are very crucial to the young mother getting greater opportunity for selfreliance and a more secure future (Nalwoga & Namuli, 2021).
To the large extent, families are looking for various means of generating money to
cover the expenses of parenting a teenager when the pregnancy was not initially
planned. Among these means could be running small businesses, taking on extra
work, or working together in a community-based revenue-generating activity. The
initiatives also help the family to take care of the increased costs of healthcare and
childcare that are associated with the teenage mother (Atuhaire et al., 2021). To
sum up, some families are seeking professional therapy or psychosocial support to
help them get through the psychological and emotional impacts of teenage
pregnancy. The teenage mother is the one who benefits the most from the
counseling service as it enables her to manage her stress, depression, and guilt. WHO

(2021) states that psychosocial support not only helps the young mother to be
accepted back into the family but also strengthens the relationships between family
members and improves the overall health of the family.
2.4 Research Gaps
Literature review reveals that social, cultural, and economic factors individually or
collectively contribute to sculpture the teenager pregnancy issue. Mental anguish,
financial pressure, and inversion of roles Family are among the problems that
pregnancy brings, and all these are big contributors to family instability. Families
are employing a wide range of coping strategies but their effectiveness remains
unknown. In targeting Bubaare Sub-County, Rubanda District with its rural setting,
the study has filled in the gaps left by previous research by telling local tales about
the impacts of teenage pregnancy on family stability and suggested even medical
treatments that might help.

CHAPTER THREE: METHODOLOGY
3.0 Introduction
The approach of the research dealing with the impact of teenage motherhood on
the family and the living conditions of the families in Bubaare Sub-County, Rubanda
District is outlined in this section. The study used a systematic approach for data
collection and analysis which guaranteed reliability and accuracy in the attainment
of the research objectives.
3.1 Study Area
The Western Region of Uganda's Rubanda District, notably Bubaare Sub-County, was
the main focus of the research. The sub-county has numerous primary and secondary
schools, health facilities, and community centers that contributed valuable
information to our study. The incidence of teenage pregnancy is a major problem in
Bubaare, a rural area with a population mostly relying on agriculture. Bubaare's
geographical position and socio-economic factors are suited for the investigation of
the consequences of teenage pregnancies on family stability, as the district has a
higher rate of teenage pregnancies than the national average.
3.2 Research Approach
Qualitative research methodology was used for a study aimed at uncovering the
genuine experiences of families undergoing the adolescent pregnancy process. The
qualitative method was responsible for painting a vivid picture of the difficulties and
often absurd social issues relating to teenage pregnancy and its impact on family

ties. Individual experiences, perceptions, and social influences all contributed to
the understanding of family stability.
3.3 Research Design
Descriptive research designs are the main methods used in the systematic
description of populations, situations, or phenomena without the researcher
intervening (Ellis & Hart, 2023). Through the descriptive research design, the study
was able to thoroughly investigate the connection between adolescent pregnancy
and family disruption. This approach was utilized in Bubaare Sub-County since it
offered the researcher insight into the features of teenage pregnancy and its effects
on family divisions. The descriptive study provided a full picture of the problems and
the solutions employed by the families in the area due to teenage pregnancy.
3.4 Research Procedure
The very first thing that the researcher did was to go through the existing literature
to find out the causes of teenage pregnancies and the consequences for family
stability. After that, the researcher got in touch with local leaders, health workers,
teachers, and parents of teenage mothers to ask for their cooperation and, at the
same time, to get permission for the collection of data.
Primary data was then collected through field visits to households, community
leaders, and institutions. Informed consent was obtained from all participants prior
to data collection.

3.5 Target Population
The study's target population of 65 individuals consisted of families with adolescent
mothers living in Bubaare Sub-County, and in addition, community leaders, teachers,
and health care personnel. The focus being more so on mothers of the age bracket
of 13 to 19 years who had at least one child, and also their immediate family of
parents, guardians, and siblings. Furthermore, community leaders, inclusive of local
council officials and religious leaders, as well as secondary school teachers, and
health workers in the local health centers, were to be part of the study. This target
population was selected because they were the ones who experienced teenage
pregnancies directly, thus giving the researchers a lot of insights into the matter of
the social, economic, and psychological impact on family stability.
3.6 Sample size determination
Using Slovin's formula, the researcher calculated the proper sample size because the
total population is 65 people. When working with a known population and a
predetermined margin of error, Slovin's formula was used to determine a
representative sample size. Using a 95% confidence level and a 5% margin of error
to account for any non-responses, the sample size was determined by estimating the
prevalence of poverty among the semi-illiterate population in comparable
situations. Slovin’s formula is expressed as:
n=
N
(1 + Ne2)
n=
(1 + 65 ∗0.0025)
n=
(1 + 65 ∗0.0025)

n= 65
1.16
n= 56
Adding 10% for non-response
New Sample Size = 56 respondents
Using Slovin’s formula above, the sample size of 56 will be calculated plus 10% nonresponse rate
3.7 Sampling techniques
The study employed purposive sampling for all categories of participants. This nonprobability sampling technique was appropriate because it allowed the researcher
to intentionally select individuals who were most relevant to the objectives of the
study and provided rich, in-depth information on the issue of teenage pregnancy and
its implications for family stability.
