ABSTRACT

For the purpose of this study the researcher sought to determine the effect of internal audit on
financial performance of commercial banks in Uganda. The specific objectives of the study
were to: determine the role of internal audit, effect and relationship between internal audit
and financial performance of commercial banks in Uganda.

Chapter two aimed at illustrating the conceptual review, empirical , critical and summary of
all the review.
Chapter three covered the methodology the researcher used in the field to collect data where
the study adopted a descriptive cross-sectional research design. The population of the study
consisted of the workers in Stanbic bank Mukono branch and thus from a targeted population
of 43 members and using the Slovene’s formula, the researcher was able to come up with an
appropriate sample size of 20. Data was mostly collected by the help of self-administered and
guided questionnaires which was later edited, coded, tabled and made ready to be presented
and interpreted.
Chapter four then discussed the interpretation and presentation of the findings obtained from
the field and thus data collected for the study were analysed by the researcher using
frequency counts, mean scores and standard deviation. Data presentation was done by use of
tables for ease of understanding and interpretation.
Chapter five provided a summary, conclusion and recommendations of the main findings
where the analysis revealed that internal audit control and procedures have a positive effect
on financial performance of commercial banks in Uganda. The study recommended that
management in commercial banks in Uganda should adopt effective internal audit practices
such as internal auditing standards, independence of internal audit, professional competency
and internal controls to enhance financial performance of the banks.

CHAPTER ONE
INTRODUCTION
1.1 Introduction
The study aims at establishing the effects of internal audit and financial performance of
commercial banks, focusing on Stanbic Bank, Mukono Branch as a case study. This chapter
presents the background to the study, problem statement, objectives of the study and
significance of the study.

1.2 Background to the Study
World-over, Bhatia (2014) suggests that internal auditing is as old as accounting. The term
audit is derived from the Latin term “audire” which means to hear. During those days, an
auditor used to listen to the accounts read over by an accountant to check them. Auditing
then evolved rapidly after the industrial revolution in the eighteenth century following the
growth of the joint stock companies that made management and ownership separate.
The shareholders who were the owners needed a report from an independent expert on the
accounts of the company managed by the board of directors who were the employees.
Shekhar (2010) also argued that the original objective of auditing was to detect and prevent
errors and fraud but this has shifted and auditing was then to ascertain whether the accounts
were true and fair rather than detection of errors and fraud. In India, the Companies Act
(1913) made audit of company accounts compulsory. With the increase in the size of the
companies and the volume of transactions the main objective of audit shifted to ascertaining
whether the accounts were true and fair rather than true and correct.

Hence the emphasis was not on arithmetical accuracy but on a fair representation of financial
efforts. The Companies Act (1913) for the first time prescribed the qualification of auditors.
Developed countries have emphasised audit as the examination of the books, accounts and
vouchers of a business. This focuses on auditors satisfying themselves that the balance sheet
is properly drawn up, so as to give a true and fair state of affairs of the business and whether
the statements of comprehensive income give a true and fair view of profit or loss for the
financial period.
In developing countries, according to Fadzil et al., (2015), most companies and financial
institutions in Sub-Saharan Africa have emphasised internal auditing as a management tool in


ensuring transparency in conduct of business. It serves as an important link in the business
and financial reporting processes of corporations and non -profit organisations.
This study intends to find out how internal auditing is important when determining the
financial performance of a business entity. Most internal audit professionals argue that an
effective internal audit function correlates with improved financial performance. Besides,
Beyanga (2011) argued that an effective internal audit service can help reduce overhead,
identify ways to improve efficiency and maximise exposure to possible losses from
inadequately safeguarded company assets all of which can have a significant effect on the
financial performance of a business entity. He also stated that internal audit is an “Invaluable
tool of management for improving performance.” Fadzilet al., (2015) also noted that internal
auditors help run a company more efficiently and effectively to increase shareholders value.”

In East Africa, Hermanson & Rittenberg (2015) who conducted a study in Kenya argued that
the existence of an effective internal audit function is associated with superior organisational
performance. Internal auditors play a key role in monitoring a business’ risk profile and
identifying areas to improve risk management. The aim of internal auditing is to improve
organisational efficiency and effectiveness through constructive criticism. Internal auditing
has four main components which include; verification of written records, analysis of policy,
evaluation of the logic and completeness of procedures.
Internal auditing services and staffing in commercial banks in Uganda is to assure they are
appropriate for the organisation’s policies; and reporting recommendations for improvements
to management (Beyanga, 2011). The subject is worthy of attention because internal auditors
are important, even crucial in an economy that relies upon independently produced
information. For most of its history, internal audit has served as a simple administrative
procedure consisting mainly of checking documents, counting assets, and reporting to the
Board of Directors, Management or External Auditors. In recent times, however, a
combination of different forces has led to a quiet revolution of the profession (Muga, 2019).
Organisations have to demonstrate accountability in the use of shareholders money and
efficiency in the delivery of services. Organisations now demand great competency and
professionalism from internal audit, and scarce resources must be deployed more efficiently
to minimise and manage risks. Technological advancement makes it possible to track and
analyse data with continually increasing speed thus making it essential for organisations to be
well advised by the internal audit department. Internal audit varies from one organisation to
another, and making change to modern internal audit can be a substantial undertaking. The


transition from merely ensuring compliance with rules and regulations to truly delivering
added value requires more than just organisational changes (Higenyi, 2020).

In many bank institutions staff is poorly paid and unmotivated, ethical standards are weak,
and governance practices are ineffective leading to asset mismanagement. The existence of
an effective internal audit function is associated with superior organisational performance. At
the empirical level, a survey conducted by Stanbic Bank, Uganda (2017) found that the
internal audit function in organisations where it exists contributes substantially to
performance improvement and assists in identifying profit evidence in corporate disasters;
particularly financial fraud consistently documents an association between weak governance.
Thus internal audit by acting as a watchdog could save the organisation from malpractices
and irregularities thus enabling the organisation to achieve its objectives of ensuring high
level of productivity and profit. In order to bridge that gap, this research seeks to study the
role of internal auditing on the financial performance of Stanbic Bank, Mukono Branch.
Financial Performance: There are many aspects of the performance of commercial banks
that can be analysed. Muga (2012) stated that the importance of bank profitability can be
appraised at the micro 4 and macro levels of the economy. At the micro level, profit is the
essential prerequisite of a competitive banking institution and the cheapest source of funds. It
is not merely a result, but also a necessity for successful banking in a period of growing
competition on financial markets. Hence the basic aim of every bank management is to
maximise profit, as an essential requirement for conducting business. At the macro level, a
sound and profitable banking sector is better able to withstand negative shocks and contribute
to the stability of the financial system. Bank profits provide an important source of equity
especially if reinvested into the business. This should lead to safe banks, and as such high
profits could promote financial stability. Schiuma (2003) mentioned accounting- based
performance using three indicators: return on assets (ROA), the return on total equity (ROE)
and Return on Investment (ROI).These are widely used to assess the performance of firms,
including commercial banks. Bank regulators and analysts have used ROA and ROE to
assess industry performance and forecast trends in market structure as inputs in statistical
models to predict bank failures and mergers and for a variety of other purposes where a
measure of profitability is desired. The main purpose of this study was to examine if internal
audits can actually enhance banks' financial performance.


1.3 Problem Statement
Ideally, internal Auditing is a catalyst for improving a business’ governance, risk
management and management controls providing insight and recommendations based on
analysis and assessment of data and business processes (Muga, 2019). With commitment to
integrity and accountability, internal auditing provides value governing bodies and senior
management as an objective source of independent advice. Recent corporate accounting
scandals and the resultant outcry for transparency and honesty in reporting have given rise to
two disparate yet logical outcomes. First, Internal Auditing skills have become crucial in
untangling the complicated accounting manoeuvres that have unclear financial statements
(Muga, 2019). Secondly, public demand for change and subsequent regulatory action has
transformed corporate governance. Increasingly, banking officers and directors are under
ethical and legal scrutiny.
Both trends have the common goal of responsibly addressing investors ‘concerns about the
financial reporting system. However, there has been laxity in implementation of internal
audit findings and recommendations due to lack of understanding of assessing skills and
methods, identifying corrective actions and losing them out and poor management decisions
making. And Stanbic bank, Mukono branch has not been without crisis, the shortcomings of
Uganda’s banking sector prior to the banking crisis of the late 1980s, and then the effect of
the measures subsequently introduced by Uganda’s Central Bank (Higenyi, 2020). Stanbic
Bank has been experiencing a fraudulent system failure where the Bank was unknowingly
sending unspecified sums of money to different mobile money users through their bank to
wallet service. In September 2020, a Director at Mcdowell Ltd wrote to the Special
Investigations Division, Criminal Investigations Directorate, calling for a special
investigation alleging that top employees of Stanbic Bank sold a mortgaged property to
themselves even after the client paid the loan. This laxity forced the researcher to carry out
the research on the internal audit functions in this branch, the role it plays in the organisation,
internal audit and asset management and how they affect the financial performance.
1.4 Objectives of the Study
To find out the effects of internal auditing on the financial performance of Commercial
banks. The study achieved the following objectives:
i.
To establish the role of internal audit and financial performance of Stanbic bank Mukono
branch.


ii.
To examine the effectiveness of internal audit on the financial performance of Stanbic bank
Mukono branch.
iii.
To examine the relationship between internal audit and financial performance of
Stanbic bank Mukono branch.

1.5 Research questions
To achieve the above desired objectives the following questions were asked:
a)
What is the role of internal audit on the financial performance of Stanbic bank
Mukono branch?
b)
What is the effect of internal audit on the financial performance of Stanbic bank
Mukono branch?
c)
What is the relationship between internal audit and financial performance of Stanbic
bank Mukono branch?
1.6 Scope of the study
The scope shows where the research study was carried out, what the research was about and
the period within which the research was carried out.
1.6.1 Area scope
The study was carried out at Stanbic bank Mukono branch, the location was considered
because it helped the researcher easily collect data due to its closeness to the university.
1.6.2 Subject scope
The study was limited to the effect of internal audit as an independent variable, financial
performance of commercial banks as the dependent variable and how the two variables relate
majorly focusing on Stanbic bank, Mukono branch.
1.6.3 Time scope
The study was carried out in a period of five months, which is from May to September 2023.


1.7 Significance of the Study
Research provides the basis for nearly all private and government policies in an economic
system (Kothari, 2014). The research would therefore be helpful to different stakeholders
both within and outside the bank as explained below;
The findings of the study will support the commercial bank (Stanbic) to put in place
strategies for their day to day management of safeguarding assets, prevention and detection
of errors and irregularities. The study shall also enhance the existing knowledge of the bank
employers concerning internal controls and its effectiveness.
To the researcher, he was intended to define the relationship between internal audit and
financial performance of commercial banks. A comprehensive knowledge of the system of
internal audit forms a foundation on which the auditor’s report on true and fair view accounts
is based and thus the study is of immense value to the practising students and reliance of
financial statements.
To the future researcher, this study is of interest to academicians and future researchers who
will undertake other studies related to this. The study also helps them come up with better
proposals on internal audit and their effects on financial performance of commercial banks.

CHAPTER TWO: LITERATURE REVIEW
2.1 Introduction
This chapter is subdivided into conceptual review, empirical review, and critical review as
detailed below.
2.2 Conceptual Review
2.2.1 Internal Auditing
According to Sovey (2011), internal auditing is an independent, objective, assurance and
consulting activity designed to add value on organisations’ operations. In contrast, Hertz
(2020) defines internal auditing as a function that helps an organisation to accomplish its
objectives by bringing systematic, disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the
effectiveness of risk management, control and government process. Nevertheless, the
researcher has a different view of what internal auditing is as; an element of internal control
system having a department established and maintained by the management of the client run
by an independent and professionally qualified personnel known as an internal auditor
capable of verifying whether financial statements and other books of accounts within an
organisation are true and fair and free from fraud and errors.

2.2.2 Internal Audit
Rossell (2018) and Kotez (2010) adds that internal audit is a process of monitoring the whole
systems of financial control establishment by management in order to carry on business of
the organisation in an efficient way, to ensure compliance with the organisation laws,
regulations and policies concerning completeness and accuracy. “Internal auditing of
businesses or companies is under company audits. These are audits that are carried out
because the law requires them.” The International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board
(IAASB) (2013) defines an internal audit function as a function of an entity that performs
assurance and consulting activities designed to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of the
entity’s governance, risk management and internal control processes. In this case, the
researcher looked at the internal audit function as a function of an organisation established
with the aim of reviewing the effectiveness and efficiency of the activities of the
organisation, ensuring compliance with established regulations, evaluation of risk
management and internal controls of an organisation.


2.2.3 Financial Performance
Financial Performance was variously defined and, in this study, was confirmed to how
financial resources are controlled and utilised through efficient budget management and
accountability to achieve organisational goals. Performance is how competent, efficient,
integrity and honesty the organisational members are at utilising the existing resources and
procedures to carry out tasks, duties and responsibilities and operations to achieve
organisational goals Evaluating the internal audit function was to examine how well it could
detect errors within an organisation as well as fraud that have received greater emphasis
(Bierstaker & Pacini, 2006).
Performance is a measure of the results achieved. Performance efficiency is the ratio between
effort expended and results achieved. The difference between current performance and the
theoretical performance limit is the performance improvement zone. Performance assumes an
actor of some kind but the actor could be an individual person or a group of people acting in
concert. The performance platform is the structure or device used in the performance act
(Malcom, S. 2005).
According to Likert (2003) there are two main ways to improve performance: improving the
measured attribute by using the performance platform more effectively, or by improving the
measured attribute by modifying the performance platform, which in turn allows a given
level of use to be more effective in producing a desired output. Performance can be measured
by obtaining the magnitude of a quantity, such as length or mass, relative
According to Khisa (2011), financial performance refers to the degree to which financial
objectives are being or have been accomplished. It is also the process of measuring the
results of a firm’s policies and operations in monetary terms. It is used to measure a firm’s
overall health over a given period of time and can also be used to compare similar firms
across the same industry or to compare industries or sectors in aggregation. Financial
analysis involves the use of financial statements; a financial statement is an organised
collection of data according to logical and consistent accounting procedures. Its purpose is to
convey an understanding of some financial aspects of a business firm. It may show a position
at a moment of time as in the case of a balance sheet, or may reveal a series of activities over
a given period of time, as in the case of an income statement.
According to Arens (2005), there are many aspects of the performance of commercial banks
that were analysed. The importance of bank profitability was appraised at the micro; most
internal audit professionals argue that an effective internal audit function correlates with


improved financial performance. An effective internal audit service can, in particular, help
reduce overhead, identify ways to improve efficiency and maximise exposure to possible
losses from inadequately safeguarded company assets all of which can have a significant
effect on the financial performance of an organisation (Arens, 2005). According to Al-
Twaijry & Gwilliam (2004), internal audit is an invaluable tool of management for
improving performance. Internal auditors help run a company more efficiently and
effectively to increase shareholders value. Finally Herman son and the existence of an
effective internal audit function are associated with superior organisational performance. The
internal audit function in organisations where it exists, contributes substantially to
performance improvement and assists in identifying profit evidence in corporate disasters,
particularly financial fraud consistently documents an association between weak governance.
Thus internal audit by acting as a watchdog could save the organisation from malpractices
and irregularities thus enabling the organisation to achieve its objectives of ensuring high
level of productivity and profit.
2.3 Empirical Literature
2.3.2 Effectiveness of internal audit
An effective internal audit aids the firm to establish how the firm can be able to improve its
governance processes, its control activities as well as how they manage risks by encouraging
suitable ethics and values, safeguarding organisational performance management and
answerability, collaborating risk control information and coordination of governance-related
undertakings (Feizizadeh, 2012). On the other hand an ineffective IA especially in the public
sector can lead to resurgence of fraud, emergence of non-compliance with standard operating
procedures thus non- factual financial decision making (Unegbu & Kida, 2011). Several
measures have been proposed to assess IA effectiveness. Pungas, (2003), Aguolu, (2009) and
Karagiorgos, Drogalas and Giovanis (2011) observed that IA effectiveness can be charged if it
meets its primary objectives. Cassandra (2008) contended that IA for it to be effective must be
objective, independent and meet the organisational status. Feizizadeh (2012) observed that IA
to be effective must meet the needs of the stakeholders; perform to the best of the internal
auditors, compliant with established professional standards and meets its own IA performance
indicators. Beckmerhagen, Berg, Karapetovic (2004) on the other hand reasoned that the IA
effectiveness should not only assess how it meets its objectiveness as well as the number of
audit reports it produces but also should include how executable the report produced is.


Trivially written IA findings add no value to the organisation or lead to inappropriate
decisions and conclusions. Without recognizing the need for IA, the tone of management can
just use IA to comply with the CBU requirements as opposed to use IA reports and
recommendations to add value to the bank's services. However, IA recommendations can
only be useful as a value add service if the IA reports are precisely written hence contributing
to better corporate governance which improves the financial performance of the banks.
Lithuanian commercial banks found that IA were minimally involved in risk management at
the banks and therefore were perceived to serve little functions other than aiding the banks to
comply with statutory requirements (Ramachandran, Subramanian, & Kisoka, 2012;
Karmanova, 2013). On the other hand, a study among commercial banks in Ghana found that
IA reports produced by in-house IA departments were not strong enough to provide
significant value to the respective banks (Ndamenenu, 2011). On the contrary a study among
commercial banks in Nigeria found that IA not only helped in compliance with statutory
requirements but also enhanced management effectiveness and efficiency of banking
operations well above costs incurred in maintaining an IA department (Etuk, 2011). Timely
communication of IA report and its recommendations enable the management to react to the
issues raised in a timely manner thus effectively mitigating organisational risks identified.
Delay in presenting IA reports and recommendations would inhibit the ability of the IA to
contribute as a value addition to the banks. IA reports should be clearly communicated to the
management for appropriate follow up on identified organisational risks and safeguard
against loss of impetus of the IA recommendations made in previous reports (Mihret &
Yismaw, 2007). A study among Jordanian commercial banks found that the management
had consistent follow-up of the IA recommendations which improved IA performance in the
subsequent reports (Awdat, 2015). A study among Ghanaian commercial banks by Ayagre,
Appiah-Gyamerah and Nartey (2014) found that the management had established a
communication system to follow-up the implementation status of recommendations from IA
reports. IA department needs to establish good communication lines with IA
primary stakeholders including senior management and the audit committee in order for IA
to effectively understand their expectations and needs to reduce chances of occurrence of role
conflict and ambiguity resulting from expectations gap. A study among commercial banks in
Rwanda found that IA had established effective communication lines with not only the
management, audit committees and board of management but also with the auditees
(Nyirabigirimana, 2015). Similarly, a study among Tanzanian commercial banks found that
IA had proper interaction with members of the audit committee that gave rise to better


functionality
of
the
IA
department
(Ramachandran, Subramanian,
&
Kisoka,
2012). Involvement of auditees during preparation of IA reports is particularly necessary
since the auditees are the implementers of the subsequent IA recommendations and hence it
is wise for their opinions to be reflected in IA reports so as to make recommendations as
practical as possible. This implies that IA have to establish a continuous communication line
with the auditees from IA evaluation and report preparation. A study among Albanian and
Greek commercial banks found that there was inadequate participation of auditees in drawing
audit reports which resulted in impractical recommendations from IA (Karagiorgos,
Drogalas, & Dimou, 2011; Kristo, 2013). On the contrary studies done by Ramachandran,
Subramanian, and Kisoka (2012) and Drogalas, Karagiorgos and Arampatzis (2015) in
Tanzania
and
Athens
Stock
Exchange’s
listed
commercial
banks
found
that
communication between IA and auditees was effective thus better functionality of internal
auditing.

2.3.3 The relationship between internal audit function and financial performance
Whittington & Pany (2001) suggest that internal auditing is performed as part of the
monitoring activity of an organisation. It involves investigating and appraising internal
controls and the efficiency with which the various units of the organisation are performing
their assigned functions. An Internal Auditor is normally interested in determining whether a
department has a clear understanding of its assignment, is adequately staffed, maintains good
records, properly safeguarding cash, inventory and other assets and cooperates harmoniously
with other departments. The internal auditor normally reports to the top management.
Gupta (2001) on the other hand asserts that ' ‘Internal audit is an independent appraisal
function established within an organisation to examine and evaluate its activities as a service
to the organisation’’. The objective of internal audit is to assist members of the organisation
in the effective discharge of their responsibilities. According to Gupta “the scope of internal
audit is determined by management”. This may however, impair the internal auditor’s
objectivity and hamper his independence, it is quite hard to report negatively on someone
who determines the scope of your work. Although at a seminar organised by the Institute of
Certified Public Accountants of Uganda (ICPAU), Sebbowa, 2009 in his presentation “The
role of Internal Audit function in Organisations”, states that “Independence is established by
organisational and reporting structure” and that “Objectivity is achieved by an appropriate
mindset”.


According to Bett (2014) the relationship between effectiveness of internal audit and
financial performance of companies listed in the Nairobi Securities Exchange, professional
competency is positively related to financial performance of companies listed in NSE. The
study further concluded that effective internal audit function is positively related to financial
performance. The researcher recommended that firms should engage skilled and competent
professional internal auditors to strengthen controls of internal audit and mitigate fraud. With
efficient internal controls, issues like fraudulent cases, cash embezzlement as well as
mismanagement of funds will be controlled, thus improving the financial performance of the
companies.
2.3.4 Role of internal audit and financial performance
According to Cooper and Craig (1983), in their study on the role of internal audit in the Asia
Pacific region, a seminal research on internal audit found a number of issues that were of
concern to the profession. It was found that there were a number of misconceptions about
what internal auditors were doing and what their chief executive officers (CEO) perceived as
being done and in fact there were expectations by the CEO’s that internal audit could do
more than the traditional financial auditing work mainly being done at that time. There was
nevertheless strong support for internal audit by CEO’s and at the time it was seen as offering
long-term career prospects. However, the profession in Australia in the early 1980’s suffered
from an image problem, it did not have a strong professional body to represent its interests as
it has now, and there were no generally accepted professional qualifications recognized as
necessary to practise as an internal auditor. The study was undertaken before the
development of modern internal auditing, as we know it now. It did, however, set the scene
for a number of subsequent studies in Australia, Hong Kong and Malaysia.
Mutua (2012) researched the impact of risk based audit on financial performance of
commercial banks in Kenya. Although her study concentrated on risk based audit, she
acknowledged that financial performance requires appropriate effective and efficient internal
audit. From the findings, the study concluded that risk based auditing through internal
auditing standards and internal auditing staffing should be enhanced to enable firms to be
able to detect risks on time and concentrate on high risk areas leading to increased
transparency and accountability, hence enhancing financial performance. This showed that
there is indeed a relationship between internal audit and financial performance.



2.4 Critical Review of the Literature
In this section, the researcher assorted some findings from previous researchers that show the
relationships existing between internal audits and banking institutions performance.
According to the Basel Committee report (2002) each bank should have a permanent internal
audit function in order to fulfil its duties and responsibilities. The senior management should
take all necessary measures so that the bank can continuously rely on an adequate internal
audit function appropriate to its size and to the nature of its operations. These measures may
include providing the appropriate resources and staffing to internal will help the institution to
achieve its goals and objectives efficiently and effectively. The survey conducted by KPMG
(1999) found that the internal audit function in organisations where it exists, contributes
substantially to performance improvement and assists in identifying profit evidence in
corporate disasters, particularly financial fraud consistently documents an association
between weak governance. Thus internal audit by acting as a watchdog could save the
organisation from malpractices and irregularities thus enabling the organisation to achieve its
objectives of ensuring high level of productivity and profit. Hodgson (1997) said that internal
audit operations and recommendations do not only have short-term effect on the running of
an organisation but are the backbone of an organisation and it dictates the prosperity or the
downfall of the particular organisation. Its effectiveness and acceptability should be stressed
at all levels and especially the management to enhance its viability. However it seems that
laxity has crept in and it is in light of this view that we seek to analyse the impact of internal
audit on the performance of commercial banks in Rwanda.
2.5 Summary of Literature Review
Only a few academic studies have examined the effectiveness of internal audit, and even
fewer have dealt with the issue empirically. In one of the very few studies that examined the
effect of internal auditing on commercial banks, Bhatia (2014) assigned bank branches to
experimental conditions (audited or not audited) and monitored their performance for a year.
Their findings showed that performance significantly improved during the half year
following the audit in the experimental branches, while the control branches experienced a
decline due to poor general business conditions. However, the reviews manifested conflicting
effects of internal auditing on financial performance of commercial banks (Khisa, 2011).




CHAPTER THREE: METHODOLOGY
3.1 Introduction
“This chapter covers the methodology the researcher used in the field to collect data.” The
chapter discussed the research design, population of study, sample size, sampling techniques
and procedures, data collection methods and procedures, data analysis, validity and reliability
and measurement of variables and ethical issues”.

3.2 Research Design
Creswell (2003) defines a research design as the scheme, outline or plan that is used to
generate answers to research problems. Further Dooley (2007) notes that a research design is
the structure of the research; it is the glue that holds all the elements in a research project
together. The study adopted a descriptive cross-sectional research design, which according to
Kothari (2004), is used when the problem has been defined specifically and where the
researcher has certain issues to be described by the respondents about the problem. Survey
designs were found to be accurate in descriptive studies and generalisations of results
(Ngechu, 2004). The study involved the evaluating of the effect of Internal Audit in the
financial performance of commercial banks, a case study of Stanbic bank Uganda.
The study also used both quantitative and qualitative research design. The researcher selected
qualitative design because the study required an in depth understanding of a particular group
of people (Merriam, 1998).
3.3 Population of the study
According to Ngechu (2004), a study population is a well-defined or specified set of people,
groups of things, households, firms, services, elements or events which are being
investigated. Thus the population should fit a certain specification, which the researcher was
studying and the population should be homogenous. The target population for this study was
the employees in the bank in different departments.
3.4 Sample size
Sampling is selecting some of the elements in a population from which a researcher may
draw conclusions about the whole population. A population group is the subject on which
measurements are obtained; it is the entity of study (Cooper & Schindler, 2010). And for the
purpose of this study, the unit of study was a commercial bank from Uganda's banking
sector, a case in point Stanbic bank, Mukono branch.


Ngechu (2004) underscores the importance of selecting a representative sample through
making a sampling frame. From the population frame the required number of subjects,
respondents, elements or firms were selected in order to make a sample.
The sample size consisted of managers, supervisors and officers from different departments.
This was purposely considered because of their knowledge regarding the area of the study
and also they were able to express specific views on the effect of internal audit and
performance of Stanbic bank. The study selected 20 members from a targeted population of
43 members. Members were selected in terms of their rankings as follows: 1 branch manager,
1 supervisor, 3 corporate customers, 10 cashiers and 5 cleaners. The Slovene’s formula was
used to come up with an appropriate sample size used in the study. Slovene’s Formula states
that, given a population, the minimum sample size is given by:
n = N/1 + Na^2
where
n = the sample size
N = total population of respondents, that is 43
a = the level of significance, that is 0.05

n = 43/1+43(0.05)^2
n = 43/1+43*0.0025
n = 43/0.011
n = 20
3.5 Sampling procedures
Sampling method is defined as a method used in order to obtain the required sample from the
study population. During the process of data collection, Probability sampling technique was
used in order to get the sample study size. Stuart (1984) defines probability sampling as the
kind of sampling in which “every element in the population has a non-zero chance of being
selected. Each individual in a sample frame drawn from the population was selected by
chance and at random. When probability sampling is used, according to Aryet al., (2002),
“financial statistics enable researchers to estimate the extent to which the findings based on
the sample are likely to differ from what they would have found by studying the whole
population”.


In this way, stratified probability sampling technique was employed by using the following
formulae;
P = F/N*n. Where; F = Number in the category
N = Total population
P = Number of respondents in the category obtained from the group
n = Total number of the respondents

Stratified random sampling is a process in which a certain sub group, or strata, is selected for
the sample in the same proportion as they exist in the population. In stratified sampling, the
researcher first identifies the strata of interest and then randomly draws a specified number of
subjects from each stratum in the population. Popham (1993) warns, however, not to simply
subdivide a population into age, sex and socioeconomic subgroups unless the researcher
believes these dimensions are relevant to the things being measured.

3.6 Data Collection Instruments
While deciding about the method of data collection to be used for the study, the researcher
should keep in mind two types of data, primary and secondary data. Primary data are those
which are collected new and for the first time, and thus happened to be original in character.
The secondary data, on the other hand, are those which have already been collected by
someone else and which have been passed through the statistical process (Kothari,
2004).“These are the methodology or means that the study used in collecting data. The study
thus incorporated the use of various methods in the process of data collection in the bid to
come up with sound, concrete and credible research findings. The researcher therefore
considered the use of interviews and questionnaires in the process of collecting primary data.
3.6.1 Interviews
“Interview is the most effective data collection method (Ferreira et al, 1988).” “Interviews
were used to correct the data collected from questionnaires, and add more information which
may not have been captured in the questionnaires and documentary review.” Interviews
allow on spot explanations, adjustments and variation can be introduced during data
collection process and through respondent’s incidental comments, use of the facial and body
expressions, tone of voice, gestures, feelings and attitudes (Amin, 2005).”


A structured interview guide was used when collecting data on lower level employees from
the banking department. An interview guide was designed and it contained both closed and
open ended questions. Also, questions were designed for the respondents relating to the topic
under study as they assisted in the collection of adequate data from the respondents.
3.6.2 Questionnaire Survey
According to Robson (1993), a questionnaire is commonly applied to research, designed to
collect data from a specific population or a sample from that population. Questionnaires are
commonly used as research instruments because of the distinct advantages they yield (Leary,
1995). Therefore, a descriptive research methodology was used to design a questionnaire for
collecting the required data.
The questionnaires were administered from office to office since all respondents were
confined in one location, apart from the opinion leaders. The questionnaires were structured
in both closed and open ended questions. Questionnaires were used to avoid subjectivity that
results from close contact between the researcher and the respondent. Also questionnaires
were preferred because they are used to collect much data over a shorter time period at lesser
costs. Questionnaires were distributed to all the sample size respondents in order to get a
wider range of respondent coverage.
3.7. Data Collection Instruments
The researcher used appropriate instruments for each method of data collection as explained
below;
3.7.1 Interview guides
The interview guide is an oral questionnaire from where the researcher gathers data through
direct verbal interactions with the respondents. The oral questions were unstructured. The
researcher used the interview guide because it gives room for probing and making
clarifications on the questionnaires.
3.7.2 Questionnaires
Questionnaires were self-administered and guided. The study embraced questionnaires
because it gathers much data within a shorter period of time and data can easily be analysed
numerically, less time consuming and gives the respondent freedom to provide answers
comfortably, Russell (2011).

3.7.3 Documentary review checklist


This is a list of documents consulted to get relevant data for the study. It helped the study to
verify facts especially during data collection. The Documentary review checklist contained
all relevant books, journals, websites, other media reports, and any other related literature to
the study.

3.9 Data Collection Procedure
According to Ngechu (2004), there are many methods of data collection. The choice of a tool
and instrument depends mainly on the attributes of the subjects, research topic, problem
question, objectives, design, expected data and results. This is because each tool and
instrument collects specific data. Donald (2006) notes that there are two major sources of
data used by respondents‘ primary and secondary data. Data collection began with a proposal
followed by a letter introducing the researcher to the case study from the department and data
collection that covered a period of about one month. The researcher administered a survey
questionnaire to each member of the target population. The questionnaires were carefully
designed and tested with a few members of the population for further improvements. This
was done in order to enhance the validity and accuracy of data that was collected for the
study.
3.9.1 Editing
Editing is the process of going through the questionnaire to ensure that the 'skip patterns'
were followed and required questions were filled out. Editing involves the inspection and if
necessary, connections of each questionnaire or observation form; the basic purpose of
editing is to impose some minimum quality standards on the raw data (Churchill, 2003).
3.9.2 Coding
Coding is the procedure by which data are categorised. Through coding, the raw data are
transformed into symbols, usually numerals that may be tabulated and counted. The
transformation is not automatic; however, it involves judgement on the part of coder (Babbie,
2008).Similar responses were grouped according to their different categories. This helped the
researcher to know for instance the percentage of responses on whether internal audit
facilitates the growth of commercial banks.



3.9.3 Tabulation
Tabulation refers to the part of the technical process of statistical analysis of data that
involves counting to determine the number of cases that fall into various categories. Thus
after eliminating errors, codes were assigned to each answer. This stage led to the
construction of statistical tables showing frequency distribution of answers to questions
addressed to respondents. The statistical tables were used to compare the number of
occurrences of each answer to questions asked. Up to this level, it was through mathematical
and statistical tables that the number of occurrence of each answer in relation to the asked
questions were converted into percentages to make it clear. Each table was accompanied by
explanations about the nature of the relationship between the variables that were indicated in
tables.
3.10 Data Analysis
Data analysis involved Presentation and Interpretation. The researcher analysed the data
collected using two methods:
3.10.1 Qualitative Data Analysis
Qualitative data analysis involves analysing and interpreting narrative data or content
analysis to bring order and understanding, which requires creativity, discipline and a
systematic approach. There is no single or best way to analyse qualitative data, for you can
adapt to your own extension evaluations. The common technique for qualitative data analysis
to be used was limited to direct interaction with the respondent and the responses recorded.
3.10.2 Quantitative Data Analysis
Quantitative data analysis involved transcribing, sorting, and classifying responses. Detailed
figures were scrutinised, analysed and correlated where necessary. Data was coded, edited
and entered into SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Scientists) data editor. Data was also
analysed using version 19 of 27 SPSS.” “Descriptive statistics such as measures of central
tendency and relationship were used to describe and summarise the data (Newman, 2005),
cross tabulation in Microsoft Excel was also used to establish the strength of the relationship
between the variables.
3.10.3 Analytical Model
The following regression model was used to perform data analysis
PROF = β 0 + β 1 IAS + β 2 IIA β 3 PC + β 4 IC+ ..............................................


Performance of the banks was measured using financial performance measures which
included the profitability of the bank that is return on assets.
The role of internal audit was measured using various internal audit standards adopted by the
commercial bank.
Independence of internal audit was measured using the level of independence of internal
auditor in the respective commercial bank.
Relationship between internal audit and financial performance was measured by the level of
professional competency of internal auditors in the bank.
3.11 Measurement of variables
The researcher used the nominal and ordinal scale in measuring the data. Nominal scale was
used for capturing gender, age, occupation, and ordinal scale was used in ranking the data.
The researcher used the Likert scale rate system to rate the opinions of the respondents
because it measures people’s attitudes, beliefs, emotions, feelings and other Psychological
constructs (Spector, et al, 2012). “A five point Likert scale was represented as follows: - 5-
Strongly Agree; 4 – Agree; 3- Neutral; 2- Disagree and 1- Strongly Disagree.”
3.12 Ethical Issues
The researcher sought permission from Uganda Christian University to conduct the study,
where a letter of introduction was provided to him by the Institution. The researcher then
introduced himself, explained to the respondents the objectives of the study, explained why
particular respondents were selected, the benefits, discomforts and harms of the study, and
requested to also be asked questions as well and also obtained informed consent from all the
respondents to the study.
The researcher designed the questions in such a way that they did not violate the rights of the
informants and he assured the respondents of confidentiality of the provided information.





CHAPTER FOUR: DATA ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATIONS
4.1 Introduction
This chapter discusses the interpretation and presentation of the findings obtained from the
field. Descriptive and inferential statistics have been used to discuss the findings of the study
as shown below;
4.1.1 Response rate
Questionnaires were prepared and sent to 25 respondents. 20 questionnaires were filled and
returned representing 80% response rate. This response rate was sufficient for information
analysis and fits in with Mugenda and Mugenda (2003) stipulation that a response rate of
70% and above is viewed as satisfactory.


Figure 4.1.1 Response rate
4.2 Data Presentation
The data was gathered using questionnaires to the commercial bank. The findings are
presented in percentages and frequency distributions, mean and standard deviations.
Inferential statistics such as correlation and regression analysis was conducted to establish
the relationship of the study variables. The following subsections further discuss the general
information of the respondents and how they responded to the main questionnaire.



4.2.1 Demographic Information
Table 1: Gender of the Respondent

Gender

Total
The study sought to determine the gender of the respondent and therefore requested the
respondent to indicate their gender. The study found that majority of the respondent as
shown by 75 % were males whereas 25% of the respondent were females, this is an
indication that both genders were involved in this study and thus the finding of the study
did not suffer from gender bias.
Table 2: Age Distribution

The study requested the respondent to indicate their age category, from the findings, 45% of
the respondents were aged between 25 to 34 years, 30 % of the of the respondent
indicated they were aged between 35 to 44 years, 15% of the respondents indicated they were
aged between 45 to 50 years, whereas 10 % of the respondents indicated that they were aged
above 51 years. This is an indication that respondents were well distributed in terms of their
age.


Table 3: Level of Education

The study requested the respondent to indicate their highest level of education. From the
findings It was established that 60% of the respondents indicated their highest level as a
degree, 20% of the respondents indicated their highest level as a college diploma,15% of the
respondents indicated their highest level of education as masters, whereas 5 % of the
respondents indicated their highest level as post graduate. This is an indication that most of
the respondents focused in this study had university degrees as their highest level of
education.
Table 4: Period of Service

Total
The study requested respondents to indicate the number of years they had served for. From
the findings the study established that 35 % of the respondents had worked for a period of
raging 6 to 10 years 30% of the respondent indicated that they had worked for a period


raging between 2 to 5 years 25% of the respondents had served for more than 10 years, and
finally 10 % of the respondents indicated to had worked for a period of less than 2 years, this
implies that majority of the respondents had served for a considerable period which indicates
that most of the respondents had vast knowledge which could be relied upon by this study.
4.2.2 Role of internal auditing
Table 5: Role of internal audit and financial performance.


Total
The study sought to establish the role of internal audit on the financial performance of
commercial banks, a case of Stanbic bank Mukono branch. From the findings 70% indicated
to a great extent, 20% of the respondents indicated to a very great extent whereas 10% of the
respondents indicated to a moderate extent. This implies that internal audit plays a great role
in the financial performance of commercial banks.

4.3 The impact of internal audit on the financial performance of the bank
Internal audit in fact is an activity which uses a disciplined approach to evaluate risk
management, control and governance processes. In a way internal audit ensures
accomplishment of corporate goals in an effective and efficient manner and as well
It looks at helping an organisation accomplish its objectives by bringing a systematic,
disciplined approach to evaluate and improve overall effectiveness and efficiency of a
company’s operations.

































CHAPTER FIVE
SUMMARY, CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
5.1 Introduction
This chapter provides a summary, conclusion and recommendations of the main findings
on the effect of internal audit function and financial performance of commercial banks.

5.2 Summary
The importance of IA is demonstrated in the growing demand for this service in all
organisations and in the rapid growth of its profession. However researchers have paid little
attention to this function and the effect it has on financial performance of organisations.
Internal auditing is an independent, objective assurance and consulting activity designed to
add value and improve an organisation's operations. It helps an organisation accomplish its
objectives by bringing a systematic, disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the
effectiveness of risk management, control, and governance processes. The internal audit
department is regarded as the key element in the application of accounting systems which in
turn, helps in evaluating the work of the department. The internal audit is considered as the
backbone of the business accounting as it is the section that records all businesses related to
the sector. The efficiency of internal audit helps develop the work of the company because
the financial reports reflect the internal audit department’s quality.

The study sought to establish the effect of internal audit function and financial performance
of commercial banks. The research design employed in this study was descriptive design.
The population of the study consisted of employees in Stanbic bank Mukono branch being
the case study chosen. The study was a census survey. The source of data used was both
primary and secondary data. The main instrument for data collection was a semi-structured
questionnaire. Data was analysed through the use of descriptive statistics and multiple linear
regression analysis. The multiple linear regression models were used to estimate the causal
relationship between financial performance and the independent variables. From the
regression model, the study found out that there were internal audit function variables
influencing the financial performance of commercial banks, which are Internal Control


Environment, Internal Control Activities, Risk Management and Monitoring Activities. They
all influenced it positively. The four independent variables that were studied explain a
substantial 78.4% of financial performance among commercial banks.
From the analysis the study established that professional competence of internal auditor
affects performance of Stanbic bank to a great extent. This established that measures that
enhance the efficiency of auditors are important for effective fraud detection, in commercial
banks frauds are identified by the internal audit function ,fraud detection, and fraudulent
activities are inherently unpredictable and difficult to detect and they affect the performance
of the bank, conscientiousness correlates with task performance just as strongly as cognitive
ability, the study established the auditors in the organisation are qualified to undertake audit
function.
The study established that internal controls affect financial performance of commercial banks
in Uganda to a great extent. The study also revealed that internal Control audits in the
organisation have features built into them to ensure that fraudulent truncations are flagged or
made difficult to transact, and that intentional errors are concentrated in relatively few audits
and these are fairly predictable by the industry, others agreed that cash receipts bear fairly
strong controls, firms that disclose an internal control problem experience a significant
increase in market-adjusted cost of capital, the greater the degree of competition, the greater
would be the need to control costs as, and that intentional errors are concentrated in relatively
few audits and these are fairly predictable by industry.

The study sought to establish that Independence of Internal Audit affects the financial
performance of commercial banks to a great extent. The study further revealed that, an
internal auditor must be independent of both the personnel and operational activities of an
organisation, the internal audit department in a banking institution must be independent from
the activities which it controls and must likewise be independent from the day-to-day internal
control processes, each bank should have formalised principles of internal audit providing for
its position and powers in the framework of the bank, Independence is the essence of
auditing, the integrity of the auditor’s opinions, conclusions and recommendations would be
suspect, internal auditors may not have a conflict of interests with the bank and finally that
independence is necessary for the effective achievement of the function and objective of
internal audit.



From the findings the study revealed that there was greater variation in financial performance
of commercial banks due to changes in internal audit standards, independence of internal
audit, professional competency and internal control, this clearly shows that changes in
financial performance of commercial banks could be accounted for by changes in internal
audit standards, independence of internal audit, professional competency and internal control.

The study also established that there was a strong positive relationship between financial
performance of commercial banks and internal audit standards, independence of internal
audit, professional competency and internal control. The study revealed that internal audit
standards, independence of internal audit, professional competency and internal control had a
positive relationship with financial performance of commercial banks.

The study found that a unit increase in internal audit standards would lead to increase in
financial performance of commercial banks, a unit increase in independence of internal audit
would lead to increase in financial performance of commercial banks, a unit increase in
professional competency would lead to increase in financial performance of commercial
banks and further unit increase in internal control would lead to increase in performance of
commercial banks.

Cooper and Craig (1983) found that there were a number of misconceptions about what
internal auditors were doing and what their chief executive officers (CEO) perceived was
being done and in fact there were expectations by the CEO’s that internal audit could do
more than the traditional financial auditing work mainly being done at the time.

Peursem (2004) found that characteristics of a true profession exist but do not dominate.
Significantly, and as subgroups, Peursem also observed that public practice and experienced
auditors may enjoy greater influence over management, and accountancy- trained auditors
may enjoy greater status owing to the mystery of the activities emanating from their
membership of well-known accountancy professional bodies. The research supports prior
studies by Coopers and Craig (1983), Cooper et al. (1966) and Gramling (1997) found that
there are three concepts characteristic of those who best balanced their role: the internal
auditor’s external professional status; the presence of a formal and an informal
communication network and the internal auditor’s place in determining their own role.
Informing these concepts is the auditor’s ability to manage ambiguity.



A survey, by Ernst & Young, found that 75 per cent of the survey respondents believe strong
risk management has a positive impact on their long-term earnings performance, an equal
percentage of the respondents believe that their internal audit function has a positive impact
on their overall risk management efforts. As the role of the internal auditor evolves and
stakeholder expectations rise, internal audit functions increasingly require competencies that
exceed the more traditional technical skills, such as the ability to team with management and
business units on relevant business issues.

Mawanda (2008) in his study established a significant relationship between internal control
systems and financial performance. The investigation recommends competence profiling in
the Internal Audit department which should be based on what the University expects the
internal audit to do and what appropriate number staff would be required to do this job.
Mutua (2012) concluded that risk based auditing through internal auditing standards and
internal auditing staffing should be enhanced to enable firms to detect risks on time and
concentrate on high risk areas leading to increased transparency and accountability, hence
enhancing financial performance. This showed that there is indeed a relationship between
internal audit and financial performance.
5.3 Conclusion
This study examined the effect of internal audit function and financial performance of
Commercial banks. The four independent variables that were studied (Internal Control
Environment, Internal Control Activities, Risk Management, Monitoring Activities) explain a
substantial 78.4% of financial performance among commercial banks.
Reager (2006) says in addition to identifying weak and overlooked controls, internal audits
often lead to process improvement discoveries or efficiency breakthroughs and that such
exchanges with internal auditors can provide employees with new perspectives on their
positions triggering ideas for process improvements or new business possibilities which leads
to an improved firm performance.
Firsteberg and Malkiel (1994) claimed that a board with eight to fewer members encourages
greater concentration, participation and authentic interactions and discussion. From the
perspective of resource dependence theory, it postulates that larger board size would result in
superior corporate performance owing to the various skills, knowledge, and expertise


contributed into the boardroom debate. In addition, large boards could also offer the diversity
that would assist companies to obtain critical resources and minimise environmental risks.
The internal audit support enhances the system of responsibility that the executive directors
and employees have towards the owners and other stakeholders (Eighme & Cashell, 2002).
Taken together, the internal audit department provides a reliable, objective, and neutral
service to the management, board of directors, and audit committee, while stakeholders are
interested in return on investments, sustainable growth, strong leadership, and reliable
reporting on the financial performance and business practices of a company (Ljubisavljević
& Jovanovi, 2011).
5.4 Recommendations for Policy
The study recommends that the companies should employ skilled and competent professional
internal auditors to strengthen the internal controls and minimise fraud. This will yield high
profits. With efficient internal controls, cases of fraud, embezzlement and cash
mismanagement will be controlled hence supplementing the level of profits in the company.
The study further recommends training of employees in the companies as an important tool
of motivating employees towards better performance. In fact through training, employees
will get motivated and fully grasp all aspects of the internal control, hence better
performance.
The study also recommends that companies should invest in market research so as to
understand what people think of their services and/or products for improving financial
performance of the companies.
Lastly the study recommends that the companies should ensure that they have a large number
of members in the auditing board as a larger board size results in superior corporate
performance owing to the various skills, knowledge, and expertise contributed into the
boardroom debate. In addition, large boards could also offer the diversity that would assist
companies to obtain critical resources and minimise environmental risks.
5.5 Limitations of the Study
There were challenges which were encountered during the study. Some officers who are
Concerned with safe custody of the companies‟ financial reports were initially reluctant to
release them. That reluctance delayed the completion of data collection.


There was also limited availability of local literature with respect to the relationship between
effectiveness of internal audit function and financial performance of commercial banks
which was overcome by consultation of foreign literatures and reference to other relevant
locally published materials.
In addition, time and resources allocated to this study could not allow the study to be
conducted as deeply as possible in terms of other predictor variables for financial
performance of commercial banks.
5.6 Suggestions for Further Studies
The study focused on commercial banks but similar studies could be undertaken to look at
the banks that are not commercial to find out whether it will yield the same results.
The Same study can be undertaken in other countries of East Africa to find out the effect of
the effectiveness of internal audit functions on the financial performance of their commercial
banks.
