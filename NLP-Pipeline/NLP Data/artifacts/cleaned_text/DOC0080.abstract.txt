Uganda presently lacks a National Intellectual Property Policy framework developed and supported
by all interested stakeholders, and covering the policy linkages between IP and public health
(including implementation of the WTO Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public
Health in Uganda); agriculture and the environment including Plant variety protection; education,
science and technology; enterprise development and regulation; protecting Uganda's rich cultural
heritage and traditional knowledge; and consumer interests.

This study therefore sets out to show how far Uganda has gone in stabilizing its Intellectual
property rights environment, more especially in terms of enforcement of the rights involved. The
first part of the study gives a summary of the Country profile with the objective of emphasizing the
need for building on the Intellectual Property potential that Uganda has to offer in fostering
knowledge - based economical growth.

The second part analyses the present regional and International IP Policy and legal framework from
which Uganda derives its obligations as a member of the World Trade Organization. It proceeds to
examine and discuss the efficacy of the enforcement mechanisms at the International and regional
level particularly with Instruments ratified by Uganda. In the same vein, it also gives a
connotational analysis of some issues prevalent in developing countries that are ignored by
developed countries in their efforts to protect their trade interests through enforcement of
Intellectual Property Rights.

The third part looks at the existing IP policy considerations, legal framework and Institutional
framework in Uganda, including local jurisprudence related to IP, from which the enforcement
mechanisms in place are determined. In the fourth part, this highlights the challenges and way
forward for the future. It addresses recommendations as to how Uganda can come up with an
effective enforcement structure for its IPR holders that befits the Country's political and socioeconomic setting.
