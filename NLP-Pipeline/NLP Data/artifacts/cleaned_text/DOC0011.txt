ABSTRACT

Domestic violence has continued to spread all over the world and stands to be a
challenge affecting many individuals, families, nation and the church at large like in
Katojo Parish, Nyabiteete Archdeaconry, North Kigezi Diocese. This problem has led to
the division in spiritual beliefs. Social norms and institutions.
This research topic aims to explore many different aspects that church leaders play in
addressing domestic violence within their congregation.
This study seeks to identify both the challenges and opportunities in creating a safe and
supporting evil for the victims of domestic violence and with findings will contribute to
a better understanding of how religious institutions can effectively address this issue,
promoting the wellbeing and safety of all members with church community.




CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION
1.0 Background of the study
Domestic violence remains a widespread problem in Uganda and has become a major
barrier to achieving national development goals, including those outlined in the
Millennium Declaration and the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Domestic
violence occurs when someone in a close relationship—such as a husband, wife, parent,
or partner—hurts, controls, or mistreats the other person. This mistreatment can be
physical, emotional, sexual, spiritual, or financial. It is a sin against God’s command to
love one another (John 13:34) and to treat each other with kindness, respect, and
dignity (Ephesians 4:32).
Christians believe that every person is created in the image of God (Genesis 1:27) and
deserves to live in peace, safety, and love. Domestic violence breaks the trust and love
that God intended for families and marriages. It goes beyond physical harm and includes
harsh words, threats, neglect, forced sexual acts, and even preventing someone from
attending church or working.
Domestic violence is not God’s will. The church must be a safe haven for victims and
speak out against all forms of abuse. God calls His people to protect the vulnerable
(Psalm 82:3-4), speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves (Proverbs 31:8),
and bring healing and justice to the suffering.
The church is called to serve and equip its ministers and members to care for families.
This mission is outlined in Matthew 28:18-20, where Jesus commands His followers to




go to all nations and make disciples. This includes ministering to and supporting victims
in a broken and, at times, violent society. Many churches and clergy may mistakenly
believe domestic violence is not a major issue within the church. However, it is a serious
and widespread problem that crosses racial, ethnic, and social boundaries and affects
even conservative Christian communities (Nelson-Clark, 2012).
In Uganda, statistics show that among married, divorced, or separated women, about
one in four has experienced emotional violence by their current or former husband.
Additionally, 40% have experienced physical violence, and 16% have experienced sexual
violence (CBS & MOH, 2006). Marriage is intended to be a life-long covenant, but due
to humanity living in a fallen world, issues like divorce and domestic violence arise. The
Bible acknowledges that brokenness and abuse in the home must be addressed.
Domestic violence cuts across all socio-economic levels, cultures, and religions.
Domestic violence refers to intentional acts of harm imposed by one partner on another,
typically through coercion, manipulation, humiliation, or force to gain control over the
other. Some families experience a cycle of violence that can last for years, with some
cases even ending in fatalities. If violence is not recognized and addressed, it escalates.
Alarmingly, deaths resulting from domestic violence are becoming increasingly
common.
Violence against women is often seen as a private matter, but women from all walks of
life experience it—rich or poor, educated or illiterate, high-ranking or low-income.
Violence affects women of all ages and should no longer be hidden behind closed doors
for the sake of family pride or stability. It is a sin that must be confronted openly.




Domestic violence is no longer just a private issue; it is a global concern. Women often
feel shame and fear, causing them to hide the violence or accept it as part of life. Some
women also perpetrate violence, highlighting the need for a broader understanding and
response.
The church has a role to play in addressing the moral decay in society. It must also
recognize that people with different values are entering the church, and church
leadership must respond appropriately. Although Scripture clearly instructs husbands to
love their wives, many victims do not feel comfortable reporting abuse to clergy. The
church’s patriarchal nature has, in some cases, led to the misuse of biblical teachings
to justify violence. For example, Ephesians 5 on submission has been misinterpreted to
encourage women to remain submissive even in abusive relationships, without proper
interpretation and context (Mollenkott, 2003:40).
Church leaders, guided by Scripture such as Jesus' references to Deuteronomy in
discussions about marriage, should proactively support families in crisis. Pastors should
not wait until a marriage is in crisis to offer biblical counsel. Providing biblical teachings
on marriage and divorce in a non-crisis setting helps couples reflect and pray about
their relationship with God's guidance. Pastoral counseling should aim not to dictate
but to guide, leaving room for God to speak through His Word.
Research shows that clergy are often the first people approached for help with domestic
violence issues (Rotunda et al., 2004:357). Clergy are seen as honest, familiar, and
spiritually aligned with their congregants. For individuals with strong religious beliefs,




clergy may be the preferred source of help as they understand the moral and spiritual
complexities involved (Shannon-Lewy & Dull, 2005:27).
Clergy are critical resources for both victims and perpetrators of domestic violence.
Since churches are not immune to domestic violence, clergy must be properly trained
to address it. Often, clergy struggle with the tension between preserving marriage and
protecting victims. Unfortunately, many lack the training necessary to support victims
effectively (Levitt & Ware, 2006:237).
Despite the church’s teachings promoting peace and harmony, reality often tells a
different story. This contradiction highlights the urgent need for studies like this one.
It seeks to draw attention to the issue and encourage church leaders to reflect, respond,
and help bring healing to families in crisis.
1.1 Statement of the Problem
Uganda is mostly a Christian country, so people expect the Church to help stop domestic
violence and build peaceful families. But in Kitojo Parish, Nyabiteete Archdeaconry, this
is not happening. Even though church leaders try to help through preaching, counseling,
and marriage programs, many church marriages still break up within five years
(Tumwebaze, 2020). This shows that the Church's efforts may not be working well.
A report from Georgia (2009) says that many survivors of domestic violence feel alone
and afraid to speak up. Churches should be a safe space, but this is not always the case.
Some people go to church leaders first when they have family problems (Williamson &
Penfold, 2004), but the help they get is not the same everywhere. Different churches




and pastors use different ways to deal with domestic violence. This makes it hard for
the Church to offer strong and clear help.
The government and NGOs in Uganda use human rights to fight domestic violence (FIDA,
2007), but the Church does not have one common plan. Because of this, many families
still suffer. This study wants to find out how church leaders respond to domestic
violence and why some methods may not be working (Jendia, 2015).
1.2 The purpose of the study
To investigate the role of the church leadership in responding to domestic violence
among their followers in Kitojo Parish Nyabiteete Archdeaconry.
1.3 Specific Objectives
a) To examine the Church leaders understanding of domestic violence in Kitojo
Parish Nyabiteete Archdeaconry.
b) To determine the framework that informs the church response to domestic
violence in Kitojo Parish Nyabiteete Archdeaconry.
c) To examine the effectiveness of the church leaders in addressing domestic
violence in Kitojo Parish Nyabiteete Archdeaconry.
1.4 Research Questions
a) What are the church leaders understanding of domestic violence in Kitojo Parish
Nyabiteete Archdeaconry?




b) What Frameworks the church leaders in Kitojo Parish Nyabiteete Archdeaconry
use in their response to domestic violence?
c) How effective is the church in addressing domestic violence in Kitojo Parish
Nyabiteete Archdeaconry?
1.5 Hypotheses and Assumptions of the Study
The study had the following hypotheses.
H1. Clergy generally agree that domestic violence is common in the Christian
communities in Kitojo Parish Nyabiteete Archdeaconry.
H2. Clergy with more counseling education or training, may be more proactive in
responding to domestic violence.
1.6 Justification of the Study
The This study sought to deepen understanding of domestic violence within Kitojo
Parish, Nyabiteete Archdeaconry, by focusing on the Christian community, the dominant
religious group in Uganda. While much research exists on domestic violence, this study
is unique because it specifically examines the role of church leaders in addressing the
issue within their congregations.
The findings can contribute to practical solutions by guiding institutions both faithbased and secular—on how to collaborate with churches in responding to domestic
violence more effectively. It would also provide churches with insights into the strengths




and weaknesses of their current methods and offer evidence-based recommendations
to improve their support systems.
At the national level, the study would generate knowledge to inform the creation of a
coordinated strategy to tackle sexual and gender-based violence, particularly through
faith-based engagement. It would also highlight key areas where clergy need further
training, supporting Bible colleges and theological institutions in strengthening their
counseling and pastoral care curricula.
Ultimately, the study would identify specific training needs for Anglican church leaders,
equipping them to play a more active and informed role in preventing and responding
to domestic violence within their communities.
1.7 Content, Geographical and Time scope of the Study
Content Scope:
This study focused on the role of church leaders in addressing domestic violence, which
is one specific form of gender-based violence. It should aim to understand how church
leaders could respond to cases of domestic violence reported within their
congregations. The study would be limited to examining pastoral care, counseling, and
other church-based interventions, and were not include other forms of gender-based
violence or responses from other religious groups.







Geographical Scope
The study was conducted in Kitojo Parish, Nyabiteete Archdeaconry, located in
Rukungiri District, Uganda. This area included several sub-parishes where church
leaders were residing within church premises and were responsible for spiritual
leadership and pastoral care. The research focused only on the Anglican Church context
within this specific geographical area.
Time Scope
The study covered a period of 10 to 15 years. This timeframe was selected because
domestic violence would have become more recognized during this period within the
Anglican Church, and efforts to address it would have gained attention. The study
allowed for analysis of how church leaders will have responded to these issues over
time.
1.8 Definition of Terms
Violence has been defined as the utilization of coercive means of power, utilization of
force or threats of its utilization to force an individual into doing something that the
individual may otherwise not do.
Violence Against women means any act of violence that causes, or has the likelihood of
causing, physical, sexual or psychological suffering or harm to women, either through
threats to do the same, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether at home
or public life.




Gender-based violence is defined as violence committed by men against women in
which the victim is mostly a woman and that results from an imbalance of power
between the sexes. Violence against people based on their gender is known as genderbased violence, and while women and girls are the main victims, boys and men are also
targeted.
Spousal abuse is referred to as domestic violence. Women to men, men to children,
women to children, and occasionally women to women can all be victims of domestic
abuse. The violence typically takes the form of a cycle of increasing physical, sexual,
and psychological abuse that can lead to severe assault with weapons or even murder.
Social isolation and economic dominance are also aspects of domestic violence.
Domestic violence has been known to occur within all racial, educational, geographic
and socioeconomic levels of society. Church is a body of Christian believers, holding the
same creed, observing the same rites, and acknowledging the same ecclesiastical
authority.
Pastoral care is the help, support, and guidance that church leaders, pastors, or
Christian teachers—give to individuals, especially during difficult times. It involves
listening, praying with someone, giving biblical advice, and showing love and
compassion in practical ways.
The pastors who serve the church's members are known as clergy. They are typically
the appointed leaders who go by the titles of reverend, pastor, priest, or bishop.

CHAPTER TWO: LITERATURE REVIEW
2.0 Introduction
A review of the literature on domestic violence in the context of this study is included
in this chapter. In addition to evaluating the material on how the church and clergy
respond to violence outside of Africa, it examines conceptual definitions of domestic
violence. It also contains works that analyze the biblical foundations that guide
Christian communities' responses to domestic abuse.
2.1 Literature Review
2.1.1 The Church leaders understanding of domestic violence in Kitojo Parish
Nyabiteete Archdeaconry.
According to the United Nations' 1993 Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against
Women, domestic violence includes physical, sexual, and psychological abuse of women
in the home, such as battering; sexual abuse of female children; violence related to
dowries; marital rape; female genital mutilation; and other harmful customs against
women. It also covers violence related to exploitation and non-spousal violence.
category (UN, 1993). Negative actions in a family or close relationship are referred to
as domestic abuse. It encompasses dominating actions, mental and physical abuse, and
sexual coercion. It is defined by the UN (1993) as when a family member or intimate
partner commits acts of physical, sexual, or psychological violence.
In the context of Kitojo Parish, domestic violence manifests in various forms:





Physical Abuse: This includes hitting, slapping, or any form of physical harm.

Emotional Abuse: Involves verbal insults, threats, and isolation from friends and
family.

Sexual Abuse: Forcing a partner into sexual activities without consent

Economic Abuse: Controlling a partner's access to financial resources
Church leaders in Kitojo Parish recognize these forms and understand that domestic
violence is not limited to physical harm but encompasses a range of abusive behaviors
that undermine the dignity and well-being of individuals.
Church leaders in Kitojo Parish, Nyabiteete Archdeaconry generally agree with this
definition, as the cases they handle often reflect these various forms of abuse.
According to Shannon-Lewy & Dull (2005:357), domestic violence is a pervasive problem
that cuts across social class, gender, race, and religion. In order to obtain power and
control over an intimate partner, it is commonly defined as a pattern of coercive
behaviors, such as physical, sexual, and psychological abuse, as well as verbal and
emotional threats and intimidation. Although domestic violence can affect men, women
are more likely to sustain serious and sometimes fatal physical harm (Rosen et al.,
2003:182; Stith & Rosen, 2004:415). Social and cultural norms that uphold gender
inequality and frequently support or encourage discrimination against women, including
male reprimands, are ingrained in domestic violence. (Ileise et al., 1994:43). It
exemplifies the unequal power relationships between women and men (Canadian Panel
on Violence Against Women, 1993:4). Domestic violence carries significant costs not




only for the individuals affected but also for society and various service sectors, such
as healthcare, which must respond to its consequences (Rosen et al., 2003:183).
Literature suggests that while many men may infrequently use physical violence, they
often resort to other forms of abuse, such as intimidation and emotional manipulation.
Physical abuse includes any act of force intended to cause fear or harm to a partner,
such as pushing, grabbing, slapping, punching, and kicking. These actions are
recognized by many as examples of physical abuse and control. Pence and Paymar
(1993:135) assert that batterers may also demand sex from their partners after an
abusive incident. For many women, this sex is further degrading, solidifying the
abuser’s power. Sexual abuse includes a range of acts that are often manifested as rape
or sexual assault in an abusive relationship. This understanding is relevant to the
situation in Kitojo Parish, Nyabiteete Archdeaconry, where church leaders frequently
encounter these types of abuse within their congregations.
Church leaders play a pivotal role in addressing domestic violence. They are often the
first point of contact for victims seeking help. In Kitojo Parish, leaders provide
counseling, spiritual guidance, and, when necessary, refer victims to appropriate
support services.
However, challenges exist. Some leaders may lack training in handling such sensitive
issues, leading to inadequate support for victims. Moreover, cultural norms may
influence their responses, sometimes prioritizing family unity over individual safety. To
enhance their effectiveness, church leaders need comprehensive training on domestic
violence, including understanding its dynamics, legal implications, and appropriate




intervention strategies. Collaborations with social workers and human rights
organizations can also bolster their capacity to support victims effectively.
According to Londt (2004:64), some abusers use sexual violence as a primary method of
intimidation and harm, which may include pressured, coerced, or physically forced sex.
Victims may also be forced into sexual activities they find humiliating, painful, or
unnatural.
Psychological and emotional abuse is another prominent aspect of domestic violence.
Paymar (2000:83) describes emotional abuse within the context of battering as a
powerful psychological weapon designed to cause pain, depersonalize the victim, and
increase the batterer's power. Ganley (1996:20) views emotional abuse as a tactic of
control, comprising a variety of verbal attacks aimed at degrading the victim’s worth
in their roles as an individual, parent, family member, friend, or community worker.
The Bible promotes love, respect, and peace within families. Scriptures such as
Ephesians 5:25 urge husbands to love their wives as Christ loved the church,
emphasizing selflessness and care. Similarly, Colossians 3:19 advises husbands not to be
harsh with their wives.
However, misinterpretations of certain passages have been used to justify abusive
behaviors. For instance, the 'submission' in Ephesians 5:22 has been misinterpreted as
male dominance, and thus abuse is perpetuated.
Theological scholars endorse contextual understandings of such scriptures with an
emphasis on love and respect for each other. They recommend church leaders to teach




followers the true meaning of such preachings and guide them towards healthy and
respectful relationships.
Cultural norms in Kitojo Parish significantly influence perceptions of domestic violence.
Traditionally, men are viewed as heads of households, and their authority is seldom
questioned. This patriarchal structure often discourages women from reporting abuse,
fearing stigma or family dishonor.
Practices such as bride price can also contribute to the problem. Once a bride price is
paid, women may be perceived as property, limiting their autonomy and increasing their
vulnerability to abuse. To address these issues, community education is vital. Church
leaders can collaborate with cultural leaders to challenge harmful traditions and
promote values that uphold the dignity and rights of all individuals.
2.1.2 Biblical stand and teaching on domestic violence.
The role of religious teachings and church leaders has been both helpful and
problematic in efforts to address domestic violence. A report by the National Catholic
Reporter in 1996 revealed that when social services in Santa Clara County, California
surveyed domestic violence victims, many stated they first turned to the church for
help. However, when asked where support was lacking, their answer was also the
church, a situation mirrored within the Anglican Church, including in Kitojo Parish.
Grady (2000:83) notes that some religious traditions teach that women should not
separate from or divorce their partners, even in cases of abuse. Some individuals use
the use of physical force to subjugate women to male authority is justified by biblical
teachings. Fortune and Enger (2005:2) contend that the church has frequently told




abused women to stay in abusive relationships, make an effort to be better wives, and
"forgive and forget" through its silence or guidance. In a similar vein, the church has
told batterers that their attempts to manipulate their girlfriends or wives are
acceptable since women are supposed to submit to men (Ephesians 5:22-24, The Holy
Bible, New International Version, 2012). In addition to immobilizing victims, religious
communities' denial and silence regarding wife abuse may unintentionally encourage
perpetrators. Given the personal and institutional role of religion in many people's lives,
it is not surprising that religious teachings influence how women deal with violence.
Through doctrines, traditions, and teachings, religious communities impart values and
belief systems to their members (Fortune and Enger, 2005:341).
The church’s response to violence against women has often been shaped by Judeo-
Christian cultural beliefs (Fox, 2002:1). In this patriarchal culture, male dominance over
women was seen as natural. Early church history, influenced by the Greco-Roman world,
supported Aristotle's theory that men should rule over their wives and children. Feminist
theologians argue that both scripture and Christian theology are ingrained in a
patriarchal culture, perpetuating biases that view women as inferior and in need of
male control (Fox, 2002:5). Consequently, church teachings have often legitimized male
violence against women. Early church doctrines included instructions that condoned
male violence, such as the belief that it was acceptable for husbands to physically
discipline their wives if necessary (Fortune and Enger, 2005:34).
Researchers have shown that church leaders are often among the first to be approached
for advice on family problems and domestic violence. However, many are ill-equipped
to provide effective help.




The Bible teaches love, kindness, and peace in the family and community. It does not
support violence in any way. From the beginning, God made both man and woman in
His image and wants them to live together in harmony. In Genesis 1:27, the Bible says,
“So God created man in His own image... male and female He created them.” This shows
that men and women are equal before God and both should be treated with respect
and love.
The Bible shows that God's plan for a family is for the husband and wife to love and
care for each other. In Ephesians 5:25, it says, “Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ
loved the church and gave himself up for her.” This verse teaches that husbands should
not harm their wives but should protect and care for them. Any form of abuse, whether
physical, emotional, or verbal, goes against God's will for marriage.
Jesus Christ always taught people to love one another. In John 13:34, He said, “A new
command I give you: Love one another.” Jesus never allowed violence and always
promoted peace and forgiveness. In homes, this means that husbands and wives should
forgive and talk things out instead of fighting or hurting each other. Violence breaks the
peace that Jesus wants in our lives.
The Apostle Paul gave advice on how Christian families should behave. In Colossians
3:19, he says, “Husbands, love your wives and do not be harsh with them.” This clearly
shows that God does not allow men to beat or mistreat their wives. Paul also tells
children to obey their parents, and parents not to anger their children (Ephesians 6:4).
This means that even parents must avoid being violent to their children.




The Bible shows that women are valuable and important. In Proverbs 31, the Bible
describes a wise and hardworking woman who is praised by her husband and children.
Women are not meant to be beaten or mistreated; they are helpers and partners to
men. The book of Galatians 3:28 says, “There is neither male nor female, for you are
all one in Christ Jesus.” This means that God values men and women equally.
Churches and pastors have a duty to speak against domestic violence. They should
counsel families to live in peace. The church should not keep silent when someone is
being beaten or abused at home. Instead, it should guide, support, and help the victims
to be safe. James 1:27 says that true religion is to “look after orphans and widows in
their distress.” This includes helping abused women and children. Silence only makes
the violence continue.
Some people wrongly use Bible verses like Ephesians 5:22, “Wives, submit to your
husbands,” to justify beating women. But the Bible does not say husbands should beat
their wives to make them submit. That verse continues to say that husbands must love
their wives as Christ loved the church. Christ never hurt the church—He died for it. This
shows that the right understanding of the Bible is against domestic violence.
The Bible teaches forgiveness, but it does not mean keeping silent about sin or abuse.
Victims can forgive abusers, but justice must still be done. In Romans 13:4, the Bible
says that governments are God’s servants to punish wrongdoers. So even if a person is
sorry, he must face the law if he has beaten someone. The church must work with police
and community leaders to stop domestic violence.




Bible Examples of Respectful Relationships in the Bible, couples like Ruth and Boaz, and
Mary and Joseph, showed care and respect. Boaz protected Ruth and gave her food
(Ruth 2:14). Joseph planned to quietly divorce Mary to protect her from shame
(Matthew 1:19). These examples show how people should treat each other with love,
not violence.
Church leaders must show good behavior in their homes. 1 Timothy 3:2-5 says that a
church leader must manage his family well and be gentle, not violent. If a church leader
beats his wife, he is not fit to lead others. He must be corrected or removed to protect
the church and community.
The church must be a safe place where people can run for help. It must not turn away
those who are hurting. Victims of domestic violence should find counseling, prayer, and
support in the church. Pastors should preach about love, peace, and the sin of abuse so
that families can be healed.
Theology means learning about God and His teachings. It helps people know what is
right and wrong. When we talk about theology and domestic violence, we are asking:
“What does God think about people hurting each other in families?” Theology teaches
that all people are made in God’s image (Genesis 1:27), so no one should be beaten,
abused, or mistreated. God made man and woman equal in value.
The Bible shows that God is loving and wants peace in families. In 1 John 4:8, it says,
“God is love.” So, if God is love, then hurting your husband or wife is not from God.
Love does not hurt people. In Ephesians 5:25, the Bible tells husbands to love their




wives like Christ loved the church. Christ did not beat the church; He died for her. That
shows us that violence is not the way to show love.
Some Christians misunderstand the Bible and use it wrongly to support violence. For
example, some men read Ephesians 5:22, which says wives should submit to their
husbands, and think that means they can control or beat their wives. But that is not
true. When you read the next verse, it says the husband must love his wife and treat
her well.
According to Fortune and Enger (2005), theology can help people stop domestic violence
when it teaches love, respect, and kindness. But if church leaders stay silent or give
wrong advice, they can also make the problem worse. That is why it is important for
pastors and church workers to be trained and understand the Bible well.
In Kitojo Parish, some church leaders are learning to teach about love and peace in the
family. They are starting to talk more about domestic violence in sermons and home
visits. This is a good step because the church is a place where many people come for
help and guidance.
2.2 The framework of the church’s’ response to domestic violence in Kitojo Parish
Nyabiteete Archdeaconry.
The leaders of the church have long been at the forefront of providing counseling to
their followers, addressing a variety of spiritual and moral issues. Clergy members are
often seen as trusted, compassionate, and available persons within their communities.
For individuals who hold strong religious convictions, the clergy members are often
viewed as the first choice for obtaining assistance in fulfilling both spiritual and moral




needs. Marriage conflict, for example, domestic violence, is one of the most common
issues addressed by church leaders because it can play a significant part in impacting
family life and spiritual life. Despite the church's impact in offering advice, domestic
violence is no exception to religious communities because violence can exist in any
social setting, including churches.
However, church leaders are often faced with a dilemma in their response to domestic
violence. On one hand, they are duty-bound to defend the sacredness of marriage, but
on the other hand, they have a duty to protect victims of abuse. This balancing act can
prove tricky to manage, especially because clerics are not necessarily trained or
educated to deal with such sensitive issues. Research by Levitt and Ware (2006:237)
highlights that the majority of the church leaders lack proper training to provide
assistance to victims of domestic violence. Such a lack of information can lead to
responses that are irrelevant to the needs of the victims.
Studies in countries like the United States and South Africa found that church leaders
see domestic violence as a serious issue but admit they are not well-informed about
appropriate treatment programs, the law, and counseling techniques. Peterson
(2006:87) notes that this lack of training restricts the actions of church leaders in
relation to domestic violence. Additionally, the majority of clergy continue to employ
such traditional, patriarchal doctrines that acknowledge men as the family head,
thereby disempowering an effective response against violence. Such doctrines, in the
majority of instances, foster a culture of silence and domestic violence normality within
the church.




In addition, gender roles play an enormous role in shaping the behavior of the church
leaders in responding to domestic violence. Research by Gengler and Lee (2001:51)
indicates that clerics holding conservative, fundamentalist religious beliefs have a
narrow conception of domestic abuse and will remain less likely to respond to cases of
domestic violence. These clergy members holding such views can emphasize male
dominance within marriage and follow archaic gender-role assumptions, leading to a
lack of intervention in cases of domestic abuse. This clinging to traditional roles may
also extend to victim-blaming, where blame for abuse is placed on the victim, further
obscuring the reaction of the church to abuse.
In contrast, studies have found that clergy with greater formal education and training
in counseling are most suited to handle domestic violence. Lowe (1986:27) concluded
that formally trained clergy in counseling resorted to professional means of tackling
domestic violence as opposed to prayer and reading the Bible alone. Trained clergy who
are taught how to recognize signs of abuse and understand the legal and psychological
effects of domestic violence can better respond appropriately, such as referring victims
to professional services and community agencies for further assistance. Trained clergy
believe they are more competent to help victims and offenders of domestic violence
and therefore intervene effectively.
In the Kitojo Parish, there is a growing consciousness of the need to equip church leaders
with training in preventing domestic violence and counseling. Clergy personnel within
the area have already begun receiving training that allows them to identify the abuse
signs and respond in a suitable manner. Such specialized training has made these church
leaders more dynamic in protecting domestic violence victims and providing the




necessary support. With ongoing introduction of training programs, church leaders in
Kitojo Parish will be well-capacitated to handle domestic violence cases in
communities.
In the future, it is clear that ongoing education and training are necessary to improve
the church's response to domestic violence. By arming clergy with the facts and skills
required to respond effectively to domestic violence, churches can be more proactive
in promoting healthy relationships, supporting victims, and speaking out against
harmful cultural values that facilitate violence. The contribution of education and
training in preparing clergy to respond against domestic violence should never be
underrated. Based on what has been surveyed from the literature, church leaders who
are better educated and trained in counseling are more likely to contribute to the
community by providing meaningful help and preventing further harm. Generally, the
response of the church to domestic violence in Kitojo Parish has evolved as a result of
increased awareness of the need for education and training in clergy. Just as in certain
churches, patriarchal structures and traditional gender constructs have led to a culture
of silence, so there is a growing awareness of the need for such specialized training in
domestic violence counseling and prevention. Church leaders, properly educated and
trained, are better equipped to deal with domestic violence, hence protecting the
victims and promoting healthier relationships within their communities.
2.2.1 Theoretical Framework
Two fundamental theoretical ideas that aid in understanding domestic abuse and how
church leaders respond to it serve as the foundation for this investigation. Feminist




studies and the notion of ecological systems. These theories shed light on how religious
ideals, cultural norms, and societal institutions affect how people respond to domestic
abuse, especially in the context of churches.
Feminist Theory
Feminist inquiry is needed to account for the way society has dealt with women unfairly,
especially in the case of domestic violence. Feminist theorists argue that violence
against women is not merely a personal issue but also embedded in a system of
gendered inequality. Feminist theory propounds that men's violence against women
arises from patriarchal structures that give men more power and control over
relationships and society as a whole.
This theory identifies that the majority of social systems like religious institutions such
as the church maintain the belief that men need to dominate women. Women in
churches, for instance, are trained to be submissive wives and mothers and re-affirm
traditional gender roles that support male dominance. Feminist writers argue that such
beliefs contribute to a culture where men's violent attitudes towards women are not
seriously addressed since the cultural norm is that men have to control the behavior,
actions, and decisions of women. Domestic violence in the home may therefore be
normalized or ignored, and women supposed to endure it as part of their family
responsibility.
Feminist theory also points out that religious and cultural institutions, churches
included, are part of this larger system that legitimates male dominance. The church
officials may therefore be bound by such patriarchal values, and it becomes difficult




for them to challenge the status quo or act forcefully when it involves addressing
domestic violence. This model is critical in the explanation of why domestic violence
may be perceived by some to be a concern of lesser magnitude or justified, in some
religious communities.
Ecological Systems Theory
The ecological systems theory, which was developed by White & Klein (2002:37), is
another influential conceptual framework to view domestic violence in the context of
church leadership. This theory suggests that a person's life is shaped through different
interacting systems such as family, culture, religion, and society. These systems shape
how one perceives and reacts to the world where he/she lives, including how one
understands issues such as domestic violence.
The ecological systems theory points out that human growth occurs in different tiers of
interrelated environmental systems. The most immediate system is the microsystem,
which consists of the individual's own attributes and immediate surroundings, such as
his own family, friends, and community. For an example of a church leader, these would
consist of his own religious community and his own marriage and family life.
The next system is the mesosystem, and this is an interaction among multiple
microsystems. An instance of this can be an interaction between church leader home
life and church work under the mesosystem. The ecosystem also encompasses broader
community environments, such as social services, legal systems, and community-based
family services that exert an indirect influence on the person's development and choicemaking.




These systems communicate with each other and influence the manner in which
individuals conceptualize and respond to social issues, such as domestic violence. For
church leaders, such intersecting systems — for example, family functioning, cultural
norms, and religious doctrine to which they are exposed — influence how they respond
to domestic violence in their churches.
Cultural Feminist Perspective
Based on feminist theory, cultural feminists argue that the majority of society's
institutions, including religion, are patriarchal. These institutions are generally
structured in manners that reinforce male dominance, and this influences how they
respond to issues like domestic violence. Traditional religious, economic, political, and
judicial institutions are structured based on masculinity, cultural feminists argue, and
they perpetuate patriarchal norms, which allow violence against women to persist. As
such, these institutions, including the church, do not necessarily challenge the
imbalance of power that perpetuates domestic violence.
The cultural feminist theorists consider that the church's response to domestic violence
is guided by these deeply rooted patriarchal values. They suggest that the church's
teachings may be inadvertently supporting male control over women, and this in turn
limits the church from being effective in responding to domestic violence. The theory
is particularly relevant in trying to explain how the church leaders' beliefs and the
overall religious community's values can impact their response to domestic violence,
making it easier or harder for a proper intervention.




This study combines feminist theory and ecological systems theory to examine how
religious, cultural, and societal contingencies influence church leaders' attitudes and
response towards domestic violence. The feminist theory is effective in describing the
violence as gender-based and systemic, whereas the ecological systems theory provides
a description of how these various contingencies, such as family history, cultural beliefs,
and religious doctrine, interface to form a church leader's definition of domestic
violence.
By examining the church both as an institution and as a community of leaders, this study
examines how these two systems interface to influence church leaders' responses to
domestic violence. The research aims to shed light on how church leaders, both shaped
by patriarchal attitudes and by the multi-systems in which they operate, may
perpetuate, as well as undermine, domestic violence among their congregants. This
approach provides a nuanced explanation of the variety of factors shaping clergy
responses to domestic violence and highlights the importance of addressing both
cultural and institutional factors in order to increase the church's role in diminishing
domestic violence.
Conclusion
In conclusion, this theoretical framework offers a greater understanding of the intricate
dynamics that influence how church leaders respond to domestic abuse by fusing
feminist theory with ecological systems theory. The systemic basis of gender inequality
and the part patriarchal ideologies play in sustaining domestic violence are both
highlighted by feminist theory. Ecological systems theory sheds light on how a person's




ideas and actions are influenced by a variety of interrelated systems, including family,
culture, and religion. When combined, these theories provide a framework for
examining how church leaders respond to domestic abuse and provide a prism through
which to examine the social, cultural, and religious factors that shape their behavior.
2.3 The effectiveness of the church leaders in addressing domestic violence in
Kitojo Parish Nyabiteete Archdeaconry.
Faith leaders, and specifically clergymen in the Anglican Church, are influential in
eradicating domestic violence in the congregation. The role entrusted to them by the
church gives them the leverage to decide the treatment of domestic violence victims,
both directly and indirectly, by influencing the culture of gender roles within the
congregation. In Kitojo Parish Nyabiteete Archdeaconry, this function is particularly
important as church leaders are often the initial chain of care for victims. Responses
by clergy are shaped by professional education, personal spirituality, culture, and the
ecclesiastical doctrine they subscribe to (Dickinson, 2007).
Social and cultural influence of gender on responses
Gender plays a significant role in shaping the responses of church leaders to domestic
violence. Men and women are socialized differently, with distinct expectations placed
on each gender. This socialization influences how both victims and perpetrators of
violence are perceived, and how their experiences are addressed by the church.
Pastors, whether male or female, bring different perspectives based on their gender,
upbringing, and experiences. A female pastor may have a more empathetic and
understanding response to female victims of domestic violence, given her own lived




experiences and the shared understanding of the challenges women face in abusive
relationships. In contrast, male pastors may sometimes struggle to relate to these
experiences, or they may hold traditional beliefs about male dominance in the family,
which can influence how they respond to women in abusive situations (Steven, 2011).
In Kitojo Parish, the church's responses to domestic violence may vary but more
importantly, they are also deeply embedded in the cultural understanding of gender
roles. In many communities, men are often seen as the head of the household, and
women are expected to submit to their husbands. This cultural belief can affect how
church leaders perceive the rights of women in the home and, ultimately, how they
advise victims of domestic violence. If the victim is a woman, the pastor's response may
be influenced by cultural norms that expect her to endure hardship, forgive, or remain
submissive, even in the face of abuse. On the other hand, some pastors, especially
those who are more progressive or trained in family counseling, may advocate for the
woman to leave her abusive relationship in order to preserve her dignity and well-being
The role of professional training in clergy responses
The level of education and professional training that church leaders receive is another
crucial factor in shaping their responses to domestic violence. Church leaders in Kitojo
Parish may have varying levels of formal education, ranging from basic certification in
theology to advanced degrees in theology and church leadership. While theological
training provides a strong foundation in scripture, it may not always adequately address
the practical skills needed to deal with issues like domestic violence. Therefore,




professional training in family counseling or social work is essential to equip clergy with
the tools to handle such sensitive situations (Steven, 2011).
Church leaders who have undergone specialized training in family counseling are better
prepared to provide the appropriate support and guidance to victims of domestic
violence. These leaders can help victims navigate the emotional and psychological
effects of abuse, providing a safe space for them to express their feelings and fears.
Most importantly, they can provide concrete advice and referrals to such services as
legal aid, medical treatment, and counseling that are absolutely vital to victims seeking
to exit abusive relationships. Without this level of professional training, clergy may be
unable to provide the assistance that is necessary or, worse, may actually contribute to
the victim's further victimization by providing advice based on outdated or problematic
assumptions (Dickinson, 2007).
A range of reactions among church leaders
In addressing domestic violence, the church leaders in Kitojo Parish give diverse
responses depending on their individual understanding of the issue and the
circumstances of the victim's situation. A common response is preaching against
violence, explaining clearly that violence is a sin and contrary to Christian teachings.
Church leaders may also provide women with counsel to submit to their husbands and
forgive their abusers, based on their interpretation of scripture like Ephesians 5:22-24,
which instructs wives to submit to their husbands. While this advice may be scriptural,
it has the adverse effect of continuing the cycle of abuse since it supports the notion




that women must tolerate mistreatment for the sake of keeping marriage alive (Steven,
2011).
But other church leaders are more liberal, calling for women to leave abusive situations
and to seek shelter. Such a response is typically rooted in a more holistic reading of
Christian teaching that emphasizes the well-being and dignity of individuals, and in this
instance, women. For example, the Bible instructs on love, respect, and mutual
submission within marriage (Ephesians 5:21-33), and there are some pastors who
interpret this to understand that abuse is never an option in a relationship. These
pastors are able to provide referrals to local domestic violence programs, legal
assistance, or counseling in a bid to help victims leave abusive situations (Steven, 2011).
Another common response of church leaders is to pray for the family and the victim,
requesting God's intervention for restoration and healing. As soothing and empowering
as prayer may be to victims, praying is not the only response that must be taken to
domestic violence. The church must do more than that and offer more proactive
responses, concrete support, and resources through which victims may be helped
practically (Dickinson, 2007).
Framework for Response to Domestic Violence
Church officials' responses to domestic violence in the Kitojo Parish are also affected
by a written and an unwritten set of rules that govern how they handle these issues.
These rules of guidance are typically based on biblical teachings and the policy of the
church, which is used to guide the clergy in handling difficult situations. However, not




all church policies explicitly address domestic violence, and others send out conflicting
messages on the appropriate response toward victims (Steven, 2011).
For example, there are leaders in church who will cite scripture about the importance
of marriage and family unity, but others will cite scripture that calls for justice,
protection, and well-being for the oppressed. Failure to have a clear, consistent
response by the church could lead to confusion among clergy and create discrepancies
in the way domestic violence is approached in different churches in Kitojo Parish.
In addition to biblical teaching, church leaders will also be guided by national legislation
and local church policy regarding domestic violence. These can provide more specific
guidelines for addressing abuse and helping victims. For instance, the Uganda Church
can establish policies to publicly condemn domestic violence and make calls for action,
e.g., establishment of committees to address domestic violence, congregational
education on healthy relationships, and pre-marriage counseling with a focus on
equality, conflict resolution, and controlling behaviors (Steven, 2011).
Steps to Improve Church Responses to Domestic Violence
The Church of Uganda must engage proactively to assist victims and stop additional
violence in order to effectively handle domestic abuse in Kitojo Parish. Creating churchbased committees to address domestic abuse is a crucial first step. These committees
can provide victims with resources, counseling, and referrals.
These committees can also work with local domestic violence programs to provide
education and support to the congregation (Dickinson, 2007).




Another notable step is for pastors to speak out about domestic violence from the
pulpit. Through raising awareness and openly condemning abuse, pastors will be able
to create a protective environment for victims to talk and seek help. The church can
also invite personnel from local domestic violence organizations to conduct educational
workshops with the congregation, fostering education and victim support for abuse
Providing a special day or week to train and activate the congregation about domestic
violence matters is an effective method. This activity can enhance awareness of abuse
signs, give church members the courage to seek assistance if needed, and foster support
and solidarity culture within the church community (Steven, 2011).
In addition, the church may introduce pre-marriage counseling classes addressing issues
of equality, conflict resolution, and controlling behaviors so that couples develop
healthier and more respectful relationships from the start. Sponsoring facilities for
domestic violence programs in the area and making financial contributions to those
programs will also demonstrate the church's dedication to serving victims of violence
Collaboration between Faith Leaders and Domestic Violence Advocates
Church leaders and other members of the faith community are frequently very involved
in the lives of victims of domestic abuse. To guarantee that victims get the allencompassing assistance they require, church leaders must collaborate closely with
advocates and service providers for domestic violence. Faith leaders and advocates for
domestic abuse can better meet the multifaceted needs of survivors and contribute to




the prevention of future violence by fostering mutual trust and cooperation (Dickinson,
2007).
Faith communities must understand that their responsibility extends beyond providing
spiritual support and that they must also take proactive measures to safeguard and
assist victims of domestic abuse. Faith leaders must be equipped with the knowledge
and resources necessary to identify and respond to signs of abuse, and they must be
prepared to provide referrals to services that can help victims escape abusive
situations. This collaborative approach can help ensure that victims receive the support
they need to heal and rebuild their lives (Dickinson, 2007).
The team of Church leaders are in this case clergy in the churches in Anglican faith. Are
tasked by the authority entrusted to them to influence by their response that Pastors
and priests help victims of domestic abuse by dividing people into men and women
based on societal and cultural norms. Because men and women are socialized
differently, a pastor's attitude to a victim of violence will depend on their gender. Men
and women react differently to violence, and a female pastor can react differently than
a male pastor. Church leaders have varying levels of professional training based on their
tertiary education, ranging from advanced degrees in theology to basic theological
certification or church leadership. In order to address domestic abuse, professional
training will also include specialized training in family counseling.
Pastors respond to violence against women in a variety of ways, from preaching against
it to advising women to leave abusive homes or to be forgiving and submissive. Prayers
and referrals for legal and medical services are also included in the response.
Additionally, the church's response to domestic violence is guided by a set of written or




unwritten guiding principles known as the Framework of Response. Such as church
policy documents and biblical teachings and texts. Everyone will be directly answering
questions about the challenges faced by clergy and what the Ugandan church can do to
stop domestic abuse. Given this, a committee to address domestic violence must be
formed. Invite staff from local domestic violence programs to give educational
presentations, encourage clergy to speak out against domestic violence from the pulpit,
and set aside a day or a month to educate and engage the congregation. In order to
demonstrate clergy involvement and take the first steps to assist victims of violence,
provide pre-marriage counseling on equality, conflict, violence, and control; provide a
meeting space in your church for the local domestic violence program; and provide
financial support to local domestic violence programs. Steven (2011).
Finding safe and efficient faith community responses to domestic violence is crucial
because many victims of domestic violence are actively involved in their lives. Finding
out what isn't working right now and what can be done to better equip faith
communities to protect survivors within their congregations is also crucial. Building
mutual trust and cooperation is crucial for faith leaders and advocates against domestic
abuse in order to better address the complex needs of victims (Dickinson, Nancy, 2007).
Researcher's Response.
In this study on the role of church leaders in addressing domestic violence in Kitojo
Parish, Nyabiteete Archdeaconry, I observed that clergy have a significant influence
over how domestic violence is addressed within their communities. Church leaders,
particularly in the Anglican faith, are entrusted with the spiritual and emotional




guidance of their congregation. Their responses to domestic violence cases often reflect
not only their theological training but also their cultural understanding of gender roles,
which can shape their approach to victims.
One of the key findings of my research is that whether clergy are male or female, their
gender influences responding to domestic violence. Clergy interpretation and response
hinge on gender socialization. Female pastors can show more empathy towards female
victims as they would be able to identify better with what the victims are going through.
On the other hand, male pastors will at times downplay abuse due to cultural demands
placing men in charge of families. This is a demonstration of the fact that there needs
to be a collaborative approach towards fighting domestic violence irrespective of the
gender of the pastor to provide justice and protection to the victims.
Furthermore, clergy members' capacity to handle domestic abuse cases to the best of
their abilities is determined by their professional training and educational background.
Clergy with specialized theological and counseling training are better equipped to
address victims' concerns with more educated advice and legal or medical care
referrals. But what was understood is that not all people in the clergy possess the
necessary skills in family counseling, and this could lead to ineffective actions that may
unintentionally reinforce the abuse cycle.
The study further established that the church's reaction to domestic violence is often
informed by how it interprets biblical scriptures and written or unwritten policies.
Clergy may largely employ scriptures supporting women's subordination to their
husbands, leading them to offer inappropriate guidance to victims. On the other hand,




other church leaders advocate for empowering and shielding victims and interpreting
scripture in order to promote justice, respect, and mutual submission in marriage.
There has been a need for more distinct and uniform church policies on domestic
violence that could provide a more unified response within the church body.
Finally, my research suggests that the Church of Uganda ought to be more proactive in
activities geared towards curbing domestic violence by forming committees that focus
on this cause, encouraging pastors to preach against domestic violence from the pulpit,
and educating the faithful. Pre-marriage counseling sessions addressing topics such as
equality, conflict resolution, and control could ensure that domestic violence does not
take place in the first place. Furthermore, cooperation with local domestic violence
organizations can provide victims with material and financial assistance, further
supporting the church's overall response to domestic violence.
Overall, church pastors in the Kitojo Parish are best situated to continue to enforce
unhealthy cultural norms or to remake them in the name of better, more compassionate
responses to domestic violence. The research suggests that sound training and
assistance for clergy, coupled with the implementation of definitive church policy and
the development of alliances with domestic violence activists, are the solutions to
improving the church's response to the issue.
2.4 Conclusion
It is clear from the data in the literature review that clergy members have a significant
role to play in addressing domestic abuse. In their capacity as clergy, they are seen as
a valuable resource and source of social support for both Christian men and women.




The special role that Ugandan clergy play in addressing domestic abuse has not yet been
the subject of any research. This study aims to ascertain how clerics' unique position
affects how they respond to domestic abuse. As an exploratory study, it should pave the
way for future investigations into the role of the church in tackling the broader issue of
gender-based violence from the perspectives of social justice and societal change.
















CHAPTER THREE: METHODOLOGY
3.0 Introduction
The techniques used to gather and examine the data were the main topic of this
chapter. The study population, sample size, sampling selection, data collection
methods and tools, data processing, presentation, analysis, and interpretation, as well
as the validity and reliability of the data gathered, were all covered. The study's
limitations were also described.
3.1 Research Design
The study used both quantitative and qualitative methods, and it was based on a case
study design. The scope and pace of the issue were determined using these methods.
Data collection from church leaders in Kitojo Parish, Nyabiteete Archdeaconry, was
prioritized. In order to gather information from the particular respondents in this
archdeaconry, questionnaires and interview guides were utilized.
3.2 Study Population
The researcher targeted different categories of people, including clergy, probation
officers, local leaders, children, and Christian victims of violence (both men and
women) in Kitojo Parish, Nyabiteete Archdeaconry, which made up a population of 60
respondents.




3.3 Sample Size Determination
The researcher selected a sample size of 55 respondents from the population of 60
subjects, as indicated in the table below.
Sample size will be determined using the using Krejcie and Morgan Formulae (1970)
n= N
1+N(e)2
Where N is the Target Population (60), n is the sample size and e is the level of
significance at 0.05
n = 60
1+60x (0.05)2
Therefore, sample size n= 55 respondents
3.4 Sampling Procedures and Strategies
The study mainly used purposive and stratified sampling technique as shown in the Table
below.
