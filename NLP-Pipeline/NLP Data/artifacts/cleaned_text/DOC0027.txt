ABSTRACT.
Uganda faces energy security, open economies and environmental degradation due
to heavy reliance on fossil fuels. This study investigates the viability of algal
biodiesel as a supplement to liquid fossil fuels, leveraging Uganda's tropical climate.
Three species of algae, namely Botryococcus braunii, Nannochloropsis sp., and
Chlorella vulgaris, were evaluated under optimised conditions for species
compatibility, lipid extraction yield, and biodiesel quality. Results indicated that
Chlorella vulgaris is the most suitable species for decentralized systems, as it
displayed the highest growth rate (13.4 cm biomass on Day 12) and a moderate lipid
yield (20–30%). Diethyl ether-isopropanol achieved the highest yield at 83.1% but
posed safety concerns, while hexane-isopropanol represented the best compromise
between viability and effectiveness. The biodiesel characteristics partially met
ASTM requirements; viscosity (2.82 mm2/s) and density (0.8335 g/cm3) were
compliant, but cetane values of 5.2 required blending with petrodiesel (B20). Algal
biodiesel is techno-feasible in Uganda, benefiting from low-cost open-pond systems,
cooperative models at the community level, and the integration of wastewater
treatment to address energy poverty, promote environmental sustainability, and
support a circular economy concept.

CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION
1.1
Background and Introduction.
The global energy map is also experiencing a sea change with nations vying to
address the twin challenge of energy security and climate change. The fossil fuels
responsible for over 80% of the world's energy use face intense pressure for their
environment-negating effects of greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, and
ecological devastation. Poor developing countries like Uganda are even worse off
since they use fossil fuels, which use up foreign reserves and expose economies to
the vagaries of international markets. Uganda alone, for instance, uses over $6
million per day in petroleum imports, yet nearly 76% of its rural population lacks
access to electricity and turns to firewood and charcoal as substitutes.
(Development, 2023). This dependency fuels deforestation (2.6% annually) and
additional health crises since indoor air pollution produces 13,000 preventable
deaths annually. Such renewable energy options as algal biodiesel then turn out to
be essential interventions in such a situation, leading the way to energy
independence, Eco compatibility, and green economic growth. Algal biodiesel—a
biofuel composed of renewable energy obtained from oil algae microorganisms—
proves particularly promising to tropical nations such as Uganda.
Compared to other biofuel crops such as maize or soybean, algae will not experience
competition with food crop production on non-potable land, seawater, or sewage
wastewater. Uganda's sunny tropical climate, 20–30°C temperatures, and rainy
seasons that follow are a perfect condition for algae to grow all year round. Locally
sourced algae Botryococcus braunii and Chlorella vulgaris have been reported to be


highly productive in lipids under local conditions, and cost-effective open pond
technology also possesses the same extent of infra-availability in Uganda.
Additionally, algae's CO2 fixation and growth potential on wastewater also possess
the same circular economy principle where wastes from farms and municipalities
are employed to produce worthwhile energy resources. As an example, Kampala's
120,000 m3/day of wastewater may simultaneously abate pollution and energy
poverty to produce algae for biodiesel. Algal biodiesel is however as yet an uncapped
potentiality in Uganda. Present research focuses on industrial-level, high-tech
systems that do not apply in decentralised, resource-poor environments. This
project bridges that gap by constructing localised, community-level systems that
take advantage of Uganda's natural strengths. (Branco-Vieira, 2020)
(Milledge, 2014) Through local algal strain optimization and integration of indigenous
knowledge into existing biotechnological pipelines, the project will put in place a
mass-scale plan for biodiesel production. The project will ensure policy support,
enable Uganda to comply with the Paris Agreement, and attain SDGs 7 (Affordable
Energy) and 13 (Climate Action). The research resolves the question of the feasibility
of algal biodiesel through species screening, culture optimization, and fuel property
determination, laying a roadmap towards renewable energy for tropical economies.




1.2
Problem statement.
Uganda is facing a grim energy crisis brought about by an increased dependence on
external liquid fossil fuel imports as petroleum, for which it spends 90% of its fuel.
The country, up to 2023, has estimated that it utilizes 6.5 million litres of petroleum
each day, spurred by industrialization, transport, and population increments. The
use accelerates environmental degradation, e.g., greenhouse gases from combustion
leading to respiratory illnesses, ozone layer depletion, and climatic change.
Transportation and extraction of fossil fuels also pose threats of oil spillage and loss
of biodiversity. The non-renewable nature of the resources also makes the Ugandan
economy vulnerable to price volatility, mismatch of demand and supply, and longterm energy insecurity. While the rest of the world is working to transition to
alternative energy sources, Uganda does not produce a single unit of alternative
energy locally, making it vulnerable to world market tendencies and unsustainable
environmental
degradation.
Potentially
rewarding
directions
toward
the
achievement of the reduction of fossil fuel use include algal biodiesel research, as
in the world's efforts by AlgaePARC, Algenol, and Sapphire Energy in the quest for
species
optimization,
genetic
manipulation,
and
mass
culture
systems.

Although such ventures show the potential of algal biofuels to reduce emissions by
50-90% depending on fossil fuel, they too have strong challenges. Their high cost of
production, technical complexity of lipid extraction and risk of contamination
restrict their suitability in constrained-resource situations such as is the case in
Uganda. In addition, existing models prioritize industrial-scale systems that may not
be suitably designed for the Ugandan environment and infrastructure, and open pond


farming and low-technology systems may be more suitable. The project promotes a
local, sustainable solution through the optimization of local algal species under
Ugandan tropical conditions. As the primary reason for using low-cost cultivation
systems, the research attempts to avoid scalability and regulatory issues with hightech systems. The model, if proven to succeed, would not only reduce Uganda's fossil
fuel importation but also serve as a reproducible model for other tropical nations,
connecting economic profitability with ecological protection.
1.3
Objectives of study.
1.3.1 Main objective.
To ascertain the production of algal biodiesel as a supplement to fossil fuels.
1.3.2 Specific objectives.
i. To identify species of algae most suitable for lipid extraction for biodiesel
production.
ii. To optimise the cultivation conditions for the identified algal species.
iii. To analyse the physicochemical properties of the obtained algal biodiesel.
iv. To develop a process design for the production of algal biodiesel.
1.4
Research questions.
1. What are the most suitable species of algae for lipid extraction for the production
of biodiesel?
2. What are the optimal conditions for the cultivation of the selected algal species
that would give maximum lipid productivity?


3. What are the physicochemical properties of the algal biodiesel produced?
1.5
Scope of study
The study was carried out in Uganda, a developing country in Africa facing a grim
energy crisis brought about by an increased dependence on external liquid fossil
fuel. A period of approximately four months was used to conduct the study in the
form of research on work by different scholars, along with data collection and
interpretation. This time frame was fairly adequate for data collection.
1.6
Justification.
Algal biodiesel can be an available, sustainable alternative using locally dominant
algae, in preventing dependence on volatile world oil prices. Uganda's
overdependence on imported fossil fuel for more than $6 million per day is a source
of economic vulnerability and environmental degradation.
The biodiesel of algae is embraced by the Renewable Energy Policy of Uganda as
well as by international pledges such as Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and
Paris Agreement. Algal biodiesel promotes the accessibility of clean energy (SDG 7),
climate action (SDG 13), and clean water (SDG 6) from the treatment of wastewater.
The conversion of biodiesel eliminates indoor air pollution from charcoal with an
impact of 13,000 premature deaths a year and the public's health improves. Through
the creation of local research partnerships and promotion of Uganda as a global
leader in sustainable biofuels, the project builds national innovation capacities and
offers solutions to pressing socio-environmental challenges.



1.7
Significance of the study
Production of biofuels by algal culture offers economic stability through rural job
creation, since open pond cultivation and low-tech harvesting are particularly viable
in the infrastructure and environmental conditions of Uganda. Algae remove CO2
during growth and lower greenhouse gas emissions by 60–90% over fossil fuels, with
their capacity for growth on wastewater or brackish water rendering pollution and
decreasing biomass energy demand-led deforestation unnecessary. (Brenna, 2010)





CHAPTER TWO: LITERATURE REVIEW.
2 Introduction
A lot of literature has been written about the subject of algal biodiesel production.
This section reviews this literature and its scope is confined to algal biodiesel
production. The review is presented in such a way that highlights research gaps,
which further justifies the present study.
2.1
Strain selection:
Three strains were selected and these are Botryococcus braunii, Nannochloropsis sp,
and Chlorella vulgaris. (Nwokoagbara, 2015)
2.1.1 Botryococcus braunii.
Botryococcus braunii is a colonial green microalga of high hydrocarbon production
potential, namely in the form of botryococcenes. It exists as pyramid colonies in a
sophisticated extracellular matrix (ECM) involved in buoyancy and protection.
(Demura, 2014)
Culture Preparation:
● Isolation: The cultures may be isolated from fresh water habitats of Uganda
where B. braunii occurs naturally. Isolation is initially accomplished by using
selective media that enhance its growth.
● Nutrient Medium: Modified Chu 13 medium is generally used, providing simple
nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus to provide for growth.


Culture Environment:
● Light and Temperature: Maximum growth is with high light intensity (2000-
5000 lux) and temperatures ranging between 20-30°C, which is favourable for
Uganda's tropical environment.
● Aeration: There should be constant aeration to keep the cells suspended and
allow nutrient uptake.
Monitoring and Harvesting:
● Growth Monitoring: Optical density can be monitored using measurements.
Chemical analysis can be employed to quantify hydrocarbon content.
● Harvesting Techniques: Flocculation or centrifugation methods are commonly
employed for harvesting due to the thick cell walls that inhibit extraction.
2.1.2 Nannochloropsis sp.
Nannochloropsis are lipid-rich and hence best suited for use in biodiesel. They are
unicellular, small but aquatic in habitats and cultivated aseptically on freshwater.
(C. Sanjurjo, 2024)
Preparation of culture:
● Isolation: As in the case of B. braunii, Nannochloropsis can be isolated from
nature, i.e., natural water sources. Locally environment conditions-tolerant
strains should be utilized.
● Medium Composition: The medium must contain sufficient nitrogen,


phosphorus, and trace elements with f/2 or Walne modified media as a
control.
Culture Environment:
● Light Requirements: Moderate intensity of light of approximately 2000 lux and
16 hours light and 8 hours dark photoperiod is desirable.
● Temperature Control: 20-25°C temperatures are desirable, which is desirable
for Uganda's climatic conditions.
Monitoring and Harvesting.
● Biomass
Growth
Monitoring:
There
should
be
spectrophotometric
determination of biomass concentration and chlorophyll content ongoing
monitoring.
● Harvesting Methods: Separation of biomass can be effectively done with the
assistance of centrifugation or membrane filtration methods based on their
size.
2.1.3 Chlorella vulgaris.
Chlorella vulgaris is a well-studied green microalga of high nutritional and protein
content. It is utilized as nutritional supplements and biofuel feedstock. (Pantea
Moradi, 2022)
Culture Preparation:
● Isolation and Maintenance: Isolation of culture can be achieved by using


freshwater ecosystems of Uganda. Cultures require a medium of high
nutritional quality such as BG11 or Chlorella medium.
● Supply of Nutrients: Adequate nitrogen and phosphorus must be supplied for
healthy growth.
Culture Conditions:
● Lighting Conditions: Chlorella vulgaris grows best in high light conditions
(around 3000 lux) with 12 hours light/12 hours dark being the ideal
photoperiod.
● Temperature Gradient: It could be cultivated best in the temperature range
20-30°C, which suits the ambient temperatures of Uganda well.
Monitoring and Harvesting:
● Growth Monitoring Methods: Optical density may be checked periodically to
ascertain growth rates. Nutrient levels must also be checked to prevent
deficiencies.
● Centrifugation and flocculation are routine procedures due to the fact that
the relatively thin cell walls of Chlorella make it easier to extract than B.
braunii.
Growth Medium:
A modified F/2 medium slightly is used for the three organisms supplemented with
extra nutrients if necessary.


Growing Conditions:
● Photobioreactors: Well-controlled light intensity, temperature, pH, and
dissolved oxygen.
● Outdoor Ponds: Open ponds are utilized in mass cultures under environmental
conditions strict control.
2.2
Lipid Yields:
Initial findings indicate that Botryococcus braunii contains the maximum lipid
content, followed by Nannochloropsis sp. and Chlorella vulgaris.
Challenges and Risks.
● Variability of the species: Variability of the species under the species can
result in various growth and lipid yields.
● Contamination: Contaminant microorganisms for contamination may impart
adverse effects to algal growth and lipid production.
● Scale-up issues: Scale-up to industrial level may be encountered with both
technical and economical issues.
Plans.
● Conduct more experiments to optimize growth conditions to each of the
selected species.
● Lipid analysis: Examine the lipid composition of all species to determine if it
can be used to produce biofuels.


2.3
Critical Review.
2.3.1 International context
Algenol, USA.
Algenol, a United States-based entity, pursued an alternative approach centred on
the direct conversion of carbon dioxide from industrial sources into ethanol, utilising
genetically modified algae, algae whose genetic material has been altered to
enhance specific traits. Their objective was to develop a process that not only
yielded fuel but also facilitated the capture of greenhouse gases, thereby addressing
two significant challenges. (Ziolkowska, 2014)
Algenol's primary technology involved specialized photobioreactors, within which
these modified algae were employed. A pivotal aspect of this process was direct
ethanol production (DEP), wherein the algae were engineered to secrete ethanol
directly into the growth medium, simplifying the extraction process. (Ziolkowska,
2014)
● Algenol reported elevated productivities, with pilot plants achieving
substantially higher yields of ethanol per acre in comparison to traditional
ethanol production from corn.
● The company also emphasized the potential for carbon capture, suggesting the


process could mitigate greenhouse gas emissions.
Despite the initial promise, Algenol encountered difficulties in scaling up its
technology to commercial levels. The genetic modification of algae engendered
some public apprehension, and the actual yields attained in larger-scale operations
did not consistently align with initial projections. Ultimately, the company
reoriented its strategic focus.
While the direct ethanol production method may present complexities for immediate
adoption in Uganda, the fundamental concept of employing algae for carbon capture
and its subsequent conversion into a usable fuel source holds relevance. Uganda
could investigate simpler methodologies for carbon dioxide utilization from
agricultural waste to foster algal growth, in conjunction with less intricate biofuel
production pathways.
Sapphire Energy, USA.
Sapphire Energy, another United States-based company, sought to produce "green
crude"—a renewable oil analogous to petroleum—directly from algae. The company
garnered considerable attention and investment with the prospect of providing a
drop-in replacement for fossil fuels. (Perona, 2017)


Sapphire Energy employed expansive open ponds to cultivate algae at a commercial
scale in the desert regions of the south-western United States. The company
concentrated on optimizing algal strains for elevated lipid production and
developing efficient harvesting and extraction methodologies. (Perona, 2017)
● Sapphire Energy demonstrated the capacity to cultivate algae on a substantial
scale in open pond systems.
● The company produced notable quantities of algal oil, which was successfully
refined into various fuels, including gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel.
Notwithstanding the technical achievements, Sapphire Energy confronted
substantial economic challenges. The cost of producing algal oil at a competitive
price with petroleum proved to be a major obstruction. Consequently, the company
scaled down its operations. Open pond systems, while less capital-intensive, are
susceptible to environmental variables and contamination.
Given its abundant sunlight, Uganda could potentially utilize open pond systems for
algae cultivation, similar to Sapphire Energy. However, it is imperative to assimilate
the lessons from Sapphire Energy's experience and prioritize cost-effective
methodologies, robust strain selection, and strategies to curtail water loss and
contamination. The production of a "green crude" could represent a long-term


objective, with an initial focus on simpler biodiesel production. Uganda must
therefore carefully evaluate the economic viability of large-scale open pond systems
and implement strategies to mitigate the risks of contamination and water loss.
Synthetic Genomics, USA.
Synthetic Genomics, under the leadership of Dr. Craig Venter, directed its efforts
toward employing synthetic biology to engineer algae for enhanced biofuel
production. Their approach involved modifying the genetic composition of algae to
augment lipid yields and improve growth characteristics. (Rock, 2021)
This company used advanced genetic engineering techniques to create algal strains
with specific traits, such as increased oil content and faster growth rates. They
aimed to create "super-algae" that could produce biofuels more efficiently. (Rock,
2021)
● Synthetic Genomics successfully engineered algal strains with significantly
higher lipid content compared to wild-type strains.
● They demonstrated the potential of synthetic biology to optimize algae for
biofuel production.


While the potential of synthetic biology is immense, the development and
deployment of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) raise environmental and
regulatory concerns. The long-term ecological impacts of releasing engineered algae
into the environment warrant careful consideration. The elevated water usage
reported for certain strains also presents a challenge.
Uganda could derive benefit from advances in algal strain improvement. However,
a cautious approach to genetic engineering is essential. A more prudent strategy
might involve concentrating on the selection and optimization of naturally occurring,
high-yielding algal strains that are well-suited to the local environment.
ENN Group, China.
ENN Group, a prominent Chinese energy company, has invested in algae-based
biofuel production, with a focus on its integration into its broader energy portfolio.
The company has explored various facets of the value chain, encompassing
cultivation, extraction, and refining. (Sun, 2019)
ENN Group has experimented with diverse cultivation systems, including
photobioreactors and open ponds, to ascertain the most suitable approach for their
requirements. They have also conducted research into efficient lipid extraction
methods, including solvent-based extraction. (Sun, 2019)


● ENN Group has demonstrated a commitment to large-scale algal biofuel
production.
● They have explored the integration of algal biofuels with existing fossil fuel
infrastructure.
Large-scale projects such as those undertaken by ENN Group necessitate substantial
capital investment and may not be directly replicable in resource-constrained
settings. The reliance on solvent-based extraction methods raises concerns about
environmental impact and safety.
Uganda can draw lessons from ENN Group's approach to integrating algal biofuel
production into the broader energy strategy. However, it is crucial to adapt the
technology to the local context, prioritizing lower-cost cultivation methods and
safer extraction techniques.
AquaFUELs, Australia.
AquaFUEls, an Australia-based entity, focused on developing integrated systems for
algae cultivation and wastewater treatment. Their approach sought to address both
energy production and environmental remediation concurrently. (Slade, 2013)


AquaFUEls utilized large-scale open pond systems to cultivate algae while
simultaneously treating wastewater. The algae consumed nutrients from the
wastewater, effectively purifying it while generating biomass for biofuel production.
(Slade, 2013)
● AquaFUEls demonstrated the effectiveness of employing algae for wastewater
treatment.
● They produced significant quantities of biomass that could be utilized for
biofuel production.
Open pond systems, while cost-effective, necessitate extensive land areas and are
susceptible to environmental factors. The efficiency of wastewater treatment can
vary depending on the algal species and the composition of the wastewater.
Uganda stands to gain considerably from the integrated approach adopted by
AquaFUEls. The utilization of algae for the treatment of wastewater from urban
centres such as Kampala, in conjunction with the production of biomass for energy,
is highly relevant. This approach holds the potential to address both sanitation
challenges and energy needs.
National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), USA.


The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in the United States has
conducted extensive research on algae biofuels, encompassing various aspects such
as strain selection, cultivation optimization, and biofuel conversion technologies.
(Karim, 2022)
NREL's research encompasses a wide range of approaches, from fundamental
laboratory studies to pilot-scale demonstrations. They have investigated diverse
algal species, cultivation systems, and extraction methods. (Karim, 2022)
● NREL has made significant contributions to the understanding of algae biology
and biofuel production.
● They have developed and evaluated various technologies for algae cultivation
and biofuel conversion.
NREL's research is primarily oriented toward the United States context, and certain
technologies developed may not be directly applicable to resource-constrained
settings. Nevertheless, their fundamental research offers valuable insights that can
inform algae biofuel development in Uganda.
Uganda can leverage NREL's extensive research findings to guide its own algae


biofuel development endeavours. The knowledge acquired from NREL's studies on
strain selection, cultivation optimization, and biofuel conversion can assist Uganda
in making informed decisions and mitigating potential setbacks.
Symbiotic, Israel.
Symbiotic, an Israel-based company, specializes in cultivating algae in seawater,
employing a unique photobioreactor technology. Their approach emphasizes the
utilization of non-arable land and saline water resources for sustainable biofuel
production. (Baggesen, 2014)
Symbiotic has developed a proprietary photobioreactor system adaptable for
deployment in coastal regions or inland areas using saline groundwater. They
cultivate specific algal strains that exhibit a capacity to thrive in high-salinity
conditions. (Baggesen, 2014)
● Symbiotic has demonstrated the feasibility of cultivating algae in seawater.
● They have developed a photobioreactor technology that can be utilized in nonarable land areas.
Photobioreactor systems, while affording high productivity and control, can be
expensive to construct and operate. The utilization of seawater may also present


challenges related to corrosion and biofouling.
While Uganda lacks a coastline, it does possess inland saline lakes. The symbiotic
technology could potentially be adapted for utilization in these areas, although a
careful evaluation of cost-effectiveness would be necessary. The emphasis on
utilizing non-arable land is pertinent to Uganda, where arable land constitutes a
valuable resource. However, the high cost of photobioreactors may be a limiting
factor for Uganda, necessitating exploration of more affordable alternatives for
saline water algae cultivation.
Muradel, Australia.
Muradel, an Australian company, developed a process designated as HTL
(Hydrothermal Liquefaction) to convert whole algal biomass into biocrude oil. Their
approach sought to simplify the conversion process and enhance energy efficiency.
(Rao, 2021)
Muradel's HTL process involves subjecting wet algal biomass to high temperature and
pressure, directly converting it into a liquid biocrude oil. This process obviates the
necessity for drying the algae, which represents an energy-intensive step in
numerous other biofuel production pathways. (Rao, 2021)


● Muradel demonstrated the feasibility of employing HTL to convert whole algal
biomass into biocrude oil.
● Their process presents the potential for enhanced energy efficiency in
comparison to traditional biofuel production methodologies.
HTL represents a promising technology; however, it necessitates high temperatures
and pressures, which can be energy-intensive. The long-term stability and quality of
the biocrude oil produced via HTL also require further investigation.
HTL technology could hold long-term relevance for Uganda, as it offers the potential
for efficient conversion of algal biomass into biocrude oil. Nevertheless, additional
research and development are needed to optimize the process for local conditions
and ascertain its economic viability.
2.3.2 Local Context.
Uganda's Energy Landscape.
The energy crisis in Uganda is certainly a pressing issue for the millions of Ugandans
who, especially if they are based in the rural areas, are grappling with a daily
challenge. That Uganda is rich in culture and stunning topography is not ultimately
the energy crisis. It is estimated that 90% of the energy consumed in Uganda comes
from imported fossil fuels. An average of over $6million dollars in daily costs is a
significant financial burden. Just think about what that money could do to tackle


the most important issues, including, education, health, and local entrepreneurs.
The fact that 76% of the population as residing in rural areas are without a
connection to the national electricity grid means that the vast majority of Ugandans
must rely on traditional energy sources like charcoal and firewood to cook and keep
warm. The over-reliance on wood fuel is having a devastating effect on Uganda's
forests, with about 2.6% of Uganda's forest disappearing annually. In addition to this
cycle of erasing forests, is the discouragement that comes with being poor and
unable to access any alternatives for energy, and also the ever-present cycle of
incorporating energy sources, becomes a contributor to degradation, affecting
people's livelihoods.
However, even amidst these challenges, there exist narratives of resilience and
innovation.
Existing Local Research:
● Makerere University: Researchers at Makerere University in Kampala are
investigating the value of Botryococcus braunii, an algal species with high oil
content. They grew B. braunii in open pond systems with some success, seeing
lipid yields of 0.8 grams per liter. However, a common limitation to breeding
B. braunii is the introduction of unwanted algal competitors, like Microcytic.
This example indicates the important ecological balancing act in these systems
that highlights complex management considerations. It is admirable that the
scientists are dedicated to showing that there is potential in these tiny
organisms, and identifying sustainable options for their communities.


● Mbarara University of Science and Technology (MUST): Mbarara University of
Science and Technology, in collaboration with the National Agricultural
Research Organisation (NARO), appears to be having some success in western
Uganda. They are reducing nutrient pollution, up to 60%, while producing
valuable biomass by cultivating chlorella vulgaris in municipal wastewater.
This is a win-win situation, with parallel activities focused on environmental
sustainability and energy production. It is notable that the researchers have
involved communities in their work, demonstrating that algae can transform a
problematic waste stream into a high value resource.
Uganda's Climate Benefits.
Uganda’s position on the globe means it receives a lot of sunshine during the year,
which is one vital commodity for algae growth. Photochemistry is the process that
algae use to convert sunlight into energy, which makes Uganda a potentially
desirable location for setting up an algae-biofuel industry. The prevalent warmth
also equates to faster growing rates of algae and this could mean increased biomass.
Cultural Limitations.
The acceptance of new technologies, such as algae biofuel production, can present
challenges. In some rural communities, land ownership arrangements that include
communal ownership and undefined boundaries may hinder large-scale algae farms.
These potential challenges could lead to land disputes and social conflict. Thus, it
is critical to engage local communities during the planning and implementation stage
of any new development, respect their traditions, and provide equitable access to
any benefits that stem from it.


Policy Barriers.
The current policy landscape in Uganda, for example, the 2007 Renewable Energy
Policy, is biased towards the development of large-scale solar and hydropower
projects. While these energy sources are key drivers of clean energy projects, they
demand a much higher capital investment and from an environmental and social
standpoint, they typically have negative effects. Biofuels, including algae, have
been overlooked in all such policies instead existing policy regimes generate a lack
of research and development investment and lack of incentives for private
investment. Additionally, companies may avoid investing in algae biofuel
technologies due to poor intellectual property rights and risk of grating access to
their innovation.
Success Stories:
Community Biodiesel Co-ops. In spite of the lack of policy support, there are also
heart-warming stories of citizens generating their own sustainable energy options.
In some parts of Uganda, citizens are developing community-owned biodiesel
cooperatives in which members are taught how to grow algae, harvest oil and make
biodiesel for the community. The small-scale setups benefit the community in the
aspects of clean energy, job creation and community empowerment. The results
find villagers uniting in cooperatives turning village ponds into sources of fuel and
income, while freeing themselves from expensive and polluting fossils.
Case Study: Lake Victoria Initiative.
A pilot scheme in Jinja, on Lake Victoria, demonstrated that sewage could be


treated by using algae with the generation of biodiesel. The pilot, initiated in 2021,
utilized algae to purify wastewater by removing impurities and generated some 150
kilograms of biodiesel monthly. Uncertainty in harvesting the algae was
inconvenient, and losses amounted to as much as 30% of the valuable biomass. This
highlights the requirement for additional training and use of more efficient
harvesting technology, even if there is some automation involved. It also highlights
the requirement for maintenance and system management in a way that will enable
one to maintain it in the end.
A pilot project in Jinja, situated on the shores of Lake Victoria, demonstrated the
potential for utilizing algae in the treatment of sewage and the simultaneous
production of biodiesel. The project, initiated in 2021, harnessed algae to remove
pollutants from wastewater, yielding approximately 150 kilograms of biodiesel per
month. However, inconsistencies in algae harvesting presented challenges, resulting
in a 30% loss of valuable biomass. This highlights the imperative for enhanced
training and the adoption of more efficient harvesting technologies, potentially
incorporating automation. It also underscores the significance of proper system
management and maintenance to ensure long-term sustainability.
2.3.3 Thematic Analysis.
An in-depth examination of the main themes that emerge from these diverse
projects, with consideration for the human element and the context of resourcelimited settings such as Uganda, is justified.
Theme: Low-Tech Solutions for the Tropics.


The feasibility of low cost, low technology solutions is brought out by efforts such
as the open pond system used by Mbarara University and similar ones aimed at
Scenedesmus in other regions of the tropics. Open pond systems provide huge cost
advantage in the capital expenses, reducing capital costs by a major factor of
approximately 80% compared to high-cost photobioreactors. With this enhanced
affordability, they become within the reach of financially disadvantaged
communities.
Open pond systems, though, have certain inherent limitations as well. Their
susceptibility to contamination by external microorganisms, which was confirmed by
the Ugandan trial 25% yield loss through invasive organisms, requires prudence. The
systems also require huge tracts of land, which may prove to be a limitation in
populous regions.
However, it should be possible to combine the simplicity of open pond systems with
the additional control offered by more advanced systems. Open ponds covered with
inexpensive, UV-resistant plastic sheets could be a hybrid solution that is a filter
against contaminants but not invasive species and reduces yield variation. This kind
of strategy can also be used in order to reduce water loss caused by evaporation, a
primary concern in arid and semi-arid areas. This people-oriented design is focused
on being affordable and flexible as well as on solving the specific problems that are
prevalent in the local area.
Theme: Waste Integration.
A few such projects are NASA's OMEGA and Symbiotic, demonstrating the potential
of algae not only to play a role in energy generation but also to address imminent


environmental issues through vaporization of waste streams. This is in the
framework of the circular economy, wherein waste there is value, not waste to be
discarded.
In Uganda, for example, the sugarcane industry produces enormous amounts of
bagasse whose estimation is 4 million tons per year.
The bagasse can be utilized to generate carbon dioxide, a nutrient for algae
production. The payoff could be huge: rather than burning this waste product,
thereby releasing greenhouse gases into the air, one might utilize it to create algae,
thereby enabling the creation of biofuel and in the process lowering carbon
emissions.
Similarly, Kampala, Uganda's capital, produces a substantial amount of wastewater
at around 120,000 cubic meters a day. The wastewater contains nutrients such as
phosphorus and nitrogen that also happen to be some of the elements that nurture
algae growth. All the wastewater actually ends up flowing into Lake Victoria, where
it kills and contaminates water creatures.
However, utilization of this wastewater for algae cultivation will yield a twin
benefit: water gets purified, thereby conserving this valuable resource, and also a
renewable resource for biofuel is made available. Such an idea of dual environmental
conservation and development economics is one that can form a significant part of
the development of the living standard of the people.
Theme: Genetic Engineering vs. Natural Strain Optimization.
One of the critical questions for research in algae biofuels is how to adapt algae


strains for high levels of biofuels. Whether to use advanced genetic engineering
techniques to produce "super-algae" or whether to focus on selection and
optimization of existing strains is not addressed. Corporations like Synthetic
Genomics have invested in genetic engineering, genetically altering algae strains to
enhance lipid production and growth characteristics. Although there is much
potential for radical improvements in the performance and growth of algae
producing biofuels, this raises important ethical issues about introducing GMOs into
the environment as well as social issues around the impact of GMOs. There are also
considerable regulatory and societal acceptance hurdles.
On the other hand, academic scientists at institutions such as NREL have focused on
identifying and optimizing rapid adaptation of existing native algal strains to specific
environmental conditions. This includes selection of strains with growth
characteristic and therefore favourable characteristics (more lipids at high levels
and higher growth rates) and optimizing their growth conditions to achieve optimal
productivity. This procedure is more environmentally beneficial and will face less
opposition from the public institutions, like NREL will have procedures for the
genetic manipulation of algae for biofuels development, which be more in line with
the principles of sustainable development with a focus on environmental
sustainability.
These criteria and preliminary research on what we currently know well regarding
algal growth and biofuels, we can be strategic in our experimentation in the lab (for
example selecting strains by cultivation from algal growth and selection from, algae
that grow under particularly favourable conditions relating algae biofuel growth to


intact ecosystem at a landscape scale).
2.3.4 Critical challenges in sustainable algae-based biofuel development:
Critiques Synthesis.
Development of algae-based biofuel as a substitute energy source is beset with
multi-faceted challenges. Besides technical limitations, socio-economic and
environmental factors, especially for poor countries such as Uganda, deserve
balanced consideration. Scalability, environmental trade-offs, technical limitations,
and conflicting local-global agendas are discussed in the review to argue the case
for context-sensitive innovation.
Scalability challenges: Bridging the gap between ambition and feasibility.
Industrial-scale facilities, such as those set up by AlgaePARC and Sapphire Energy,
require up-front investment exceeding USD 5-10 million, which is cost-prohibitive
for most developing nations. Pilot-scale projects (such as Mbarara University's) are
not able to find funding to scale up, leading to a "valley of death" in which promising
technology cannot survive through to implementation in society.
This affordability-scalability trade-off can be reduced using an incremental, modular
approach. In that it enables communities to begin small and scale up incrementally
as finance allows, such an approach balances scalability vs. affordability and local
capacity development. These systems will also reduce the dependency on foreign
finance, in accordance with Uganda's aspiration for self-sustaining energy solutions.
Environmental trade-offs: Water scarcity and unintended consequences.


While algal biodiesel has the potential to address both fossil fuel reliance and
climate change, it is important to consider the environmental risks and trade-offs.
For example, commercial open algal cultivation takes a considerable amount of
water, and in some parts of the world, such as parts of Uganda, that water will be
limited.
Algal strain developers like Synthetic Genomics suggest that some GM algal biomass
can take over 500 litres of water to yield a kilogram of biomass. Such excessive water
use might exacerbate an already acute scarcity in places like Karamoja where they
have issues in obtaining drinking water. This is a case in which an effort to address
one environmental issue (climate change) might have a consequence of worsening a
different environmental issue (water scarcity).
Therefore, one of the long-term areas of focus for algae cultivation and biodiesel
development will have to be the water-efficient algal strains and cultivation systems
that have some water efficiency built into them. This could involve selecting
naturally occurring algal strains from arid or semi-arid regions, or developing unique
cultivation systems that have reduced loss of water through evaporation. It will also
be important to objectively consider whether any ecological issues could stem from
algae cultivation at a commercial scale and design and manage systems that will
mitigate this from the outset.
Technical Barriers.
The extraction of lipids from algal biomass is yet another major bottleneck in algal
biodiesel production. Traditional extraction technologies, such as the use of hexane
as the solvent, can achieve extraction efficiency of 95% and above but hexane


presents concerns around human and environmental safety. Hexane is a volatile and
flammable compound that has to be carefully disposed of and handled.
Alternatively, mechanical extraction processes like pressing, are a more simple
extraction process but their extraction efficiencies are not as effective and range
from 40% to 50% for typical cases. This inefficiency means that most of the energy
contained in algal biomass is being wasted in the extraction process and that there
is a barrier to increasing the efficiency of algal biodiesel plants overall. This shows
that there is an urgent need for more sustainable and effective extraction options.
Enzymatic extraction is a promising option for algal lipid extraction. Enzymes
interface with the algal cell wall to disrupt the cell wall and allow potential
liberation of lipids. Enzymes are biological catalysts and are typically less damaging
for the environment and human safety than using dangerous chemicals. Enzymatic
extraction is also a newer technology and there will be a need for research to help
glean and develop the technology towards greater economic viability. Global vs.
Local Priorities.
Finally, we must be mindful of the tension between global priorities (for example,
climate change mitigation) and local priorities (for example, energy access and
poverty alleviation). Algal biofuels can contribute to global objectives with respect
to reducing greenhouse gases, but the likelihood of algal biofuels adopted in
developing countries like Uganda will depend largely on their ability to meet local
needs and priorities.
For instance, mechanisms like carbon markets intended to reward global decreases
in carbon emissions may not factor into the present needs of Ugandan communities


struggling to access basic energy. For example, Ugandan communities in need of
energy access may primarily interested in reliable and affordable access to energy
for cooking, lighting and powering their small businesses.
Algal biofuels can help address local needs, but only if their production is both
sustainable, affordable, and culturally relevant. We should move from a top-down,
externally imposed solution focus, to a bottom-up, local community-participatory
algae biofuel project development and implementation approach. This transition
could help ensure that algae biofuel projects develop in alignment with local needs
and priorities and that they included sustainable development.




CHAPTER THREE: METHODOLOGY.
3 Methodology.
3.1
Ascertaining the effect of extraction temperatures and different solventbased extractions on lipid yield and quality.
Algae was collected from an identified source (Lake Victoria) and lipid extraction
was done at different temperatures ranging between 20 and 60 Celsius degrees. The
lipid yield and quality at the different temperatures was determined.
Furthermore, lipid extraction was attempted with different solvents such as hexane,
ethanol, methanol and chloroform. The lipid yield for each solvent was ascertained
and the most effective solvent determined.
3.2
Comparing the effectiveness of different catalysts.
Comparisons were done during the trans-esterification process to convert the
obtained algal lipids into biodiesel. The catalysts that were investigated included an
acid such as sulphuric acid or hydrochloric acid, a base catalyst, preferably sodium
hydroxide, and an enzyme catalyst.
3.3
Determining the physicochemical properties of the obtained algal
biodiesel.
Fulfilling this specific objective involved performing a series of tests on the obtained
bio-diesel to determine its properties. The parameters investigated included energy
viscosity, density, flash point and ignitability, and some of the necessary laboratory
apparatus included a viscometer, densitometer and flash point tester. The results


for each test performed was then recorded and the data analysed.
