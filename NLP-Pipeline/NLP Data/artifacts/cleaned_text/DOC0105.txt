ABSTRACT
Dust on unpaved roads is one of the major tragedies affecting Uganda and the world at
large especially in sub-Saharan climates with high temperature and traffic which results
into the disintegration of the soil particles by moving trucks on the road surface. The
study aims at assessing the use of magnesium chloride as a dust suppressant on unpaved
roads in Uganda with the focus on Bbaale-Galilaya road in Kayunga district due to high
dust levels on this road which reduces visibility resulting into accidents. So the material
aims at the reducing on particulate matter to correspond with the air quality standards
of Environment Protection Agency (EPA) and World Health Organization (WHO).The
study identifies key and specific objectives such as Assessing the use of magnesium
chloride as a dust suppressant as the main objective and determining the concentration
of particulate matter present in dust, assessing the properties of magnesium chloride
and the optimum amount required to suppress the dust levels along Bbaale-Galilaya
road. On Bbaale-Galilaya road, the particulate matter was above the environmental
protection agency (EPA) and the World Health Organization (WHO) standards which
included 84.485/m3, 115.835/m3,138.5/m3, 128.5/m3 and 111.165/m3 at various
distances of 50m, 100m, 150, 200m and 250m which were 50m apart or away from each
other. After magnesium chloride application, the optimum percentage attained or
obtained was 15% of the magnesium chloride solution which achieved the environmental
protection agency compliance with a particulate matter of 28.5/m3 which is below 35
standard for environmental protection agency therefore balancing environmental
safety and indicating a 80% reduction in particulate matter present in dust along Bbaale-
Galilaya road in Kayunga district.

CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION
1.1.
BACKGROUND
Dust is a collection of tiny particles that are suspended in air or settled on surfaces
(Kumar et al.,2020). This dust is made up of various substances such as pollen, dead
skin cells, viruses, bacteria, fungal spores etc. and the different forms of dust include
inorganic dust which is derived from mineral such as silica, asbestos and heavy metals,
organic dust which is obtained from biological sources for example pollen fungal spores,
combustion derived dust, aerosol dust and many others. (Madapusi et al., 2020). This
dust however has various effects on humans such as respiratory problems like asthma,
allergies, ski and eye irritation etc. and environmental impacts which affects climate,
air quality and water resources (Shang et al., 2020).
Different mitigation measures have been put in place globally by the World Health
Organization (WHO), to reduce dust emissions, such as setting guidelines for air quality
(WHO, 2020). However, in African countries, for example Uganda, dust has been
regulated through organizations such as the National Environment Management
Authority (NEMA) and Uganda National Roads Authority (UNRA), which regulate dust
emissions and maintain roads (NEMA, 2019). UNRA reduces dust accumulation by
applying bitumen and other substances to roads and implementing various dust control
measures, such as the application of water, which binds dust particles and prevents
their release into the atmosphere (UNRA, 2021).



1.2. PROBLEM STATEMENT.
Dust is a prevalent tragedy on many roads in Uganda today more especially on the
unpaved or gravel roads, this dust is composed of different particles sizes therefore it
is lost as a fine material referred to as particulate matter i.e. PM10 and PM2.5 (Barnes,
2021).Dust levels are normally high during the dry seasons due to heavy trucks and other
vehicles which disintegrate the soil particles down on the ground and they become
airborne resulting into high dust levels which later gives rise to air pollution.
Bbaale-Galilaya road which has a stretch of approximately 85kilometres in Kayunga
district experiences a challenge of high dust levels which reduces on the visibility of
the pedestrians, cyclists and other road users resulting into accidents (Raihan, 2021).
The number of accidents on this road is however increasing due to lack of enough vision
by mostly the cyclists and pedestrians as they sometimes fail to see the high speeding
vehicles and trucks resulting into collisions or head ons and this are mainly due to the
high concentration of dust particles along this road (Juuko, 2023).
Different measures have been put in place along this road to mitigate this tragedy such
as the application of water to suppress the high dust levels but however this has not
been all that effective as the dust rises few hours after its application.
This study therefore aims at the use of a salt based chemical known as MAGNESIUM
CHLORIDE due to the different properties it has for effective dust suppression such as
hygroscopic and deliquescent properties which enables it to absorb moisture from the
air that it use during binding action and stabilization of the soil particles thereby
holding them on the ground ( Murata et al., 2023).


1.3. OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY
1.3.1. Main Objective
To assess the use of magnesium chloride as a dust suppressant along Bbaale-Galilaya
road
1.3.2. Specific Objectives
1. To determine the concentration of particulate matter along Bbaale-Galilaya road.
2. To determine the different properties of magnesium chloride.
3. To determine the optimum amount of magnesium chloride needed in dust
suppression.
1.4. RESEARCH QUESTIONS
1. What is the concentration of particulate matter along Bbaale-Galilaya road?
2. What are the different properties of magnesium chloride?
3. What is the optimum amount of magnesium chloride needed to suppress dust?
1.5. JUSTIFICATION
Magnesium chloride is an inorganic salt compound composed of one magnesium and two
chloride ions i.e. MgCl2. (Zhitao, 2024). When it’s applied or added to the soil, it
attracts and retains moisture from the air since it’s a hygroscopic material and this
forms a liquid solution which helps it to bind with the fine particles thereby reducing
on the dust particles on the road hence suppressing more dust particles per gallon
compared to water (Kakinaga et al., 2023).


Magnesium chloride has a high affinity for water molecules due to their ionic and polar
nature therefore it is composed of both positive and negative ions i.e. magnesium and
chloride ions respectively which are highly polar which implies that they attract polar
water molecules and attraction occurs through “ion-dipole” interactions where Positive
and negative ends of water molecules are drawn to opposite charges on the ions (Shukla
et al.,2020).
Magnesium chloride mode of application on this road will be through spraying since it
will be applied in a liquid form or solutions and sprayed on the road surface using
specialized equipment such as trucks mounted with spray nozzles(Bingyi et al.,2022)
and the following are the different reactions of magnesium chloride with water and
temperature.
1.5.1. Reaction with Water
Magnesium chloride solution is soluble in water therefore it reacts with water
molecules giving rise to hydrolysis reaction which is as follows
MgCl2 (aq)+2H2O(l) Mg(OH)2 (s) + 2HCL(aq)
And also forms a hexahydrate compound as part of its structure known as Magnesium
chloride hexahydrate
MgCl2+6H2O→MgCl2⋅6H2O
1.5.2. Reaction at high temperatures
When magnesium chloride is exposed to high temperatures, it solidifies but due to its
hygroscopic property it will absorb more moisture from the atmosphere which takes it


back to its liquid form which improves its binding action of the dust particles
(Kubaschewski, 2020). The quantity of magnesium chloride to be applied however varies
depending on several factors such as traffic volume, road width, road surface type
therefore on Bbaale-Galilaya road since it’s a medium traffic road the quantity of
magnesium chloride per kilometer applied will range between 2500 to 4000 liters or
660 to 1056 gallons for effective dust suppression and this will help in the binding action
of the soil particles down on the ground thereby preventing their rise into air which in
the end improves the visibility for road thereby minimizing on the accidents caused due
to high dust levels and at the same time mitigating air pollution (Yong et al., 2022).
1.6. GEOGRAPHICAL SCOPE
The study will be conducted on Bbaale-Galilaya road in Kayunga Road on co-ordinates
of 0 50 49 0 “N 32” 52’ 44 0 “F (latitude 0 846944 longitude 32 878889) at Chainage
0+400 to 0+600 a distance of 200m
1.7. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY
The major aim of the study to reduce the high dust levels of dust along Bbaale-Galilaya
road through assessing the use of magnesium chloride as a dust suppressant so as to
reduce on the number of accidents which occur due to limited visibility by the
motorists, cyclists and pedestrians who use this road





CHAPTER 2: LITERATURE REVIEW
2.1. DUST
This refers to tiny particles suspended in air or settled on surfaces, and it exists in
various forms each with distinct characteristics and potential impacts on human
health and the environment. (D'Alessandro et al., 2021).
2.1.1. Forms of dust
2.1.1.1. Inorganic dust
This refers to the type of dust derived from mineral sources such as silica, asbestos,
heavy metals etc. (NIOSH, 2020).
2.1.1.2. Organic dust
This refers to dust derived from biological sources such as pollen, fungal spores,
bacteria etc. (Samet & Spengler, 2018).
2.1.1.3. Combustion derived dust
This refers to dust which results from burning fossil fuels for example particulate matter
which involves particulate matter of PM10 and PM2.5 implying particulate matter ≤
10μm and particulate matter ≤ 2.5μm respectively. This particulate matter is composed
of various substances such as minerals like silica, alumina, iron oxide etc. and metals
like lead, cadmium, arsenic etc., organic compounds such as hydrocarbons and
biological particles like pollen, fungal spores etc (WHO, 2021).





2.1.1.4. Settled dust
This refers to dust, which is deposited on surfaces for example house dust, industrial
dust etc. (Madapusi et al., 2020).
2.1.1.5. Aerosol dust
This refers to suspended particles in air for example fog, smoke, haze etc. (EPA, 2020).
2.1.1.6. Total suspended particulates (TSP)
This refers to all particles suspended in air.
2.2. DUST CLASSIFICATIONS
Dust can also exist in different forms depending on.
2.2.1. Size
✓ Coarse particles (PM10) which is 10μm or larger
✓ Fine particles (PM2.5) which is 2.5μm or smaller
✓ Ultrafine particles (PMO.10) which 0.1μm or smaller
2.2.2. Composition
✓ Mineral dust i.e. silica, asbestos
✓ Metallic dust i.e. iron, copper
✓ Biological dust i.e. pollen, fungal spores
Dust has various sources on which it accumulates along the road which is as follows


2.3. SOURCES OF DUST
1. Natural sources for example soil, sand
2. Human activities such as construction, mining
3. Industrial processes such as grinding, crushing
4. Vehicle emissions
However, when this dust accumulates more on the road it poses health risks on human
being for example respiratory problems like asthma, skin irritations, eye irritations etc.
therefore to reduce these risks, different mitigation measures have been put in place
to suppress dust and some of them include
2.4. WATER
This refers to a clear, colorless and odorless liquid substance that is essential for life
on earth and it’s a vital component of all living organisms therefore it plays a vital role
in many biological, chemical and physical processes and the following are some of its
properties which are divided into two i.e. Chemical properties and physical properties
2.4.1. Chemical properties
➢ Water has a molecular weight of 18,015g/mol
➢ It has a density of 1g/cm liquid and 0.92g/cm ice
➢ Water has a boiling point of 100 degrees Celsius and freezing point of 0
2.4.2. Physical properties
➢ Water is clear i.e. colorless liquid
➢ Water is odorless i.e. it has no smell


➢ Water is tasteless i.e. no taste
Water is a commonly used dust suppressant on many roads in Uganda today and it’s
because of the following reasons.
✓ Water reduces on the dust particle movement through binding the dust particles
together which prevents them from becoming airborne (Kumar et al.,2020)
✓ Increases the particle size. This is because water absorption increases the dust
particle weight which makes them less likely to be suspended in air ( Madapusi
et al., 2020)
✓ Lowers dust cloud formation. This is because water wets dust particles which
prevents them from becoming airborne (Puppala et al.,2019)
During this dust suppression, water application rates vary depending on the light,
medium and heavy dust control therefore its applied through various methods which
include spraying , misting and use of irrigation systems(Yulong, 2020) and after being
applied, dust is suppressed through agglomeration where the water causes dust
particles to clump together thereby increasing their size and weight which prevents
them from being re-suspended into the atmosphere (Sanjay, 2021).
Dust however accumulates again few hours of approximately 1 to 3hours after its
application since water is effective for short term dust suppression (Wang et al, 2019)as
it suppresses dust to a percentage of 50-70% making it less effective compared to
Magnesium chloride which as a long term dust suppression period as it suppresses dust
on a long run to a period of approximately 1 to 7 days after its application which 80 to
95% effectiveness and also suppresses more dust per gallon compared to water.


2.5. COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS BETWEEN PARTICULATE MATTER OF PM10 AND PM2.5
2.5.1. Size and Penetration
PM10
PM10 is composed of larger particles up to 10 μm in diameter and penetrates the
upper respiratory tract, nose, throat, and bronchi but is often trapped by natural
defenses like nasal hair or mucus. PM10 cause irritation of the eyes, nose etc. (WHO,
2021).
PM2.5
PM2.5 consists of smaller particles of 2.5 μm or less in diameter and penetrates
deeper into the lungs and can reach the alveoli, the tiny air sacs responsible for gas
exchange in the lungs (EPA, 2020). PM2.5 can enter the bloodstream which affects the
cardiovascular system and other organs (WHO, 2021).
Therefore, in conclusion basing on size and penetration, PM2.5 is more dangerous
because its smaller size allows it to penetrate deeper into the body.
2.6. CHEMICAL COMPOSITION AND TOXICITY
PM10
This consists of coarse particles from natural sources such as soil, dust, and pollen and
carries toxic substances that are less concentrated compared to PM2.5.
PM2.5
This Contains finer particles often originating from combustion processes, including
vehicle emissions, industrial processes, and burning fossil fuels.
PM2.5 carries more toxic compounds such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs),


heavy metals, and sulfates which have a higher potential for causing harm (Chen et
al., 2020).Therefore PM2.5 poses greater health risks due to its higher toxicity
compared to PM2.5

2.7. HEALTH EFFECTS
PM10. PM10 irritates the eyes, nose, throat, and upper respiratory tract and
with long exposure, it causes respiratory diseases such as asthma and
bronchitis. (NIOSH, 2020)
PM2.5
PM2.5 is associated with more serious health effects which includes increased risk of
heart attacks and strokes, worsening of chronic diseases like asthma therefore Longterm exposure has been linked to reduced lung function and cancer. (WHO, 2021;
Samet & Spengler, 2018).
In conclusion PM2.5 has more serious and systemic health effects than PM10.
2.8. AIR QUALITY STANDARDS
Air quality guidelines set by international organizations demonstrate the differing
dangers of PM2.5 and PM10




Table 1 Air quality guidelines
Parameter

Guidelines

EPA
Standards
12 μg/m3 (annual mean); 35
50 μg/m3 (annual mean); 150

The stricter limits for PM2.5 reflect its greater impact on health therefore PM2.5 is
considered a critical pollutant for public health interventions globally (WHO, 2021).The
Air quality standards highlight that PM2.5 as more hazardous due to its lower allowable
concentrations.
2.9. MAGNESIUM CHLORIDE AS A DUST SUPPRESSANT
This is an inorganic salt chemical compound which is composed of magnesium ions and
chloride ions with 23.3% and atomic mass of 24.305g/mol and 76.7% with atomic mass
of 35.453g/mol respectively. It is used as a dust suppressant because of its effectiveness
and environmental benefits which makes it desirable during dust suppression.
2.9.1. Properties of magnesium chloride.
Physical Properties
Magnesium chloride is highly hygroscopic, meaning it absorbs moisture from the
atmosphere, which is critical for its effectiveness in binding fine dust particles (Chase,
2021). It exists as a crystalline solid, typically colorless, and forms hydrates like


magnesium chloride hexahydrate (MgCl2·6H2O) under humid conditions. These hydrates
enhance its ability to retain moisture, crucial for stabilizing dust on roads (NIST, 2023).
The compound has a melting point of 714°C and is highly soluble in water hence easily
applied in liquid solutions (USGS, 2023).
Chemical Properties
When dissolved in water, magnesium chloride dissociates into magnesium (Mg2+) and
chloride (Cl−) ions. It is these ions that, through ion-dipole interactions with dust and
water molecules, build a binding matrix that resists the release of dust into the air
(Chase, 1998). Under certain conditions, this chemical also reacts with water, leading
to hydrolysis and the formation of magnesium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid, further
indicating the reactivity and possible impacts on specific environments (NIST, 2023).
Thermal Properties
Magnesium chloride has very good thermal stability, with a hygroscopic capacity
unaffected by increasing temperature; it works efficiently in a wide range of climate
conditions. The values for heat and enthalpy have been documented in scientific
literature to date and supplement its ability in dust suppression and industry
applications (NIST, 2023).
2.9.2. Environmental Considerations
Magnesium chloride is considered environmentally friendly because it naturally
degrades with minimal ecological effects, over-application can result in soil salinity and
contaminate water. Thus, its use has to be done responsibly to maximize benefits with
minimum risk. USGS, 2023.


Benefits of magnesium chloride during dust suppression
✓ Magnesium chloride is highly effective. This is because it reduces dust emissions
by 80 to 95% (Kumar et al.,2020)
✓ Long lasting. Magnesium chloride remains effective for several months after its
application (Madapus et al., 2020)
✓ Environmental friendly. It is a biodegradable and non-toxic chemical therefore
has no harm on the environment (EPA, 2020)
✓ Soil stabilization. Magnesium chloride helps to bind down the soil particles which
reduces on erosion and increases stability
The application of magnesium chloride however also varies depending on the kind of
suppression needed i.e.
✓ 0.5-1.5 kg/m for light dust suppression
✓ 1.5-3kg for moderate dust suppression
✓ 3-5kg/m for heavy dust suppression
Magnesium chloride mode of application along roads during dust suppression involves
different methods but the most used method is the spraying method




2.9.3 SPRAYING METHOD
This is a method where spray nozzles are mounted onto trucks to allow easy spray of a
chemical or a substance and the following is how magnesium chloride is applied using
this method
➢ Selected chain age to be suppressed is graded using graders to clear the surface
➢ The surface is then pre-wetted with Water to ensure that magnesium chloride
penetrates effectively when it is moist
➢ Magnesium chloride is then mixed with water to create a liquid solution with a
concentration of 25% to 35%
➢ Water Truck is mounted with spray nozzles that are then used to spray the
chemical uniformly along the selected section of the road
➢ The chemical is then absorbed and binded with the soil particles and due to its
hygroscopic property, it absorbs moisture from the atmosphere that it uses to
bind down the soil particles which prevents them from becoming airborne


Precautions followed during the application of magnesium chloride during
dust suppression
✓ Wearing of protective gears when handling magnesium chloride
✓ Avoiding the application of magnesium chloride during strong winds or
heavy rainfall


2.9.4. MODE OF ACTION OF MAGNESIUM CHLORIDE DURING DUST SUPPRESSION
Magnesium chloride mainly achieves it dust suppression effectiveness through the
following ways
Hygroscopic property
When magnesium chloride is applied, it absorbs moisture from the atmosphere which it
uses to reduce on the mobility of the dust particles (Kumar et al, 2020)
Surface tension reduction. It then reduces on the surface tension of the absorbed
moisture or water molecules which enhances its ability to bind dust particles that are
more likely to become airborne (Chen et al, 2020)
Particle aggregation
It achieves this through making dust particles heavier due to the attracted moisture
which reduces on the rise of dust particles into the atmosphere. (Samet & Spengler,
2018).
What makes magnesium chloride a good dust suppressant method?

Magnesium chloride is hygroscopic in nature therefore this implies that it can absorb
water molecules from the atmosphere that improves its binding action.(Chen et al.,
2016). It’s composed of the magnesium and chloride ions which have strong electro
static forces that its uses to pull or attract water molecules from the atmosphere. After
water molecules are absorbed these form a brine solution that acts a sticky coating that
help to trap dust particles down onto the ground which prevents it from becoming
airborne resulting into the deliquescent property therefore magnesium chloride is a


good dust suppressant because of its hygroscopic and deliquescent property(Kumar et
al.,2020).
2.9.4. COMPARISON OF MAGNESIUM CHLORIDE WITH WATER DURING DUST
SUPPRESSION
Long-lasting
Magnesium chloride forms a brine solution when applied to the surface which creates a
sticky layer on the ground thereby binding soil particles together therefore this brine
effect is long lasting and resists evaporation and wear compared to water which tends
to evaporate quickly and loses its effectiveness (Hammond et al.,2013)
Reduced dust resuspension
When magnesium chloride is applied, it reduces dust resuspension because it form a
thin sticky film on the surface that binds dust particles together unlike water which
temporarily suppresses dust as it does not have the same binding effect as magnesium
chloride therefore results into more dust rise into the atmosphere once water
Evaporates (Nash et al.,2010).

Hygroscopic nature
Magnesium chloride is highly hygroscopic which enables it to attract and absorb
moisture from the air. This ability helps to keep the surface moist or damp which
reduces the likelihood of dust particles being lifted by wind while water on the other


hand evaporates quickly especially in the hot or dry conditions and lacks the same
ability to retain moisture (Pasternald et al.,2006)
2.9.5. IMPACT OF WEATHER CONDITIONS ON MAGNESIUM CHLORIDE AFTER
APPLICATION
WIND
Magnesium chloride absorbs and retains moisture due to its hygroscopic nature
therefore this makes the surface moist or damp and reduces on the effect of being
carried away by wind (Pasternald et al., 2006)
RAIN
Moderate rain dissolves magnesium chloride and spreads it more evenly across the road
thereby improving its ability to retain moisture and suppression of dust (Smith et al.,
2018)
TEMPERATURE
In warm temperature with moderate or high humidity, magnesium chloride attracts
moisture which keeps the road surface damp thus reducing dust and this is due to its
hygroscopic property however at very high temperature i.e. temperatures above 40°C,
rapid evaporation occurs which reduces on the moisture being absorbed by Magnesium
chloride since the humidity in the atmosphere is low


LEACHING OF CHEMICALS
Leaching
This refers to the process by which soluble substances for example chemicals, minerals,
nutrients or other contaminants are dissolved and carried away by water moving
through the soil or other materials. Leaching occurs when rain water or ground water
percolates through the soil dissolving chemicals and carrying them downwards (Brady
et al.,2016) leaching can however be addressed through use of acceptable
concentrations of magnesium chloride corresponding to the environmental protection
agency EPA as this reduces on the leaching effect of the chemical after its application.
TIME SERIES ANALYSIS TEST IN DUST SUPPRESSION.
Time series analysis is a standard statistical methodology applied to research into
trends, patterns, and relationships in data gathered over time. When proposed to dust
suppression studies on unpaved roads, this encompasses everything regarding the
effectiveness of the intervention through the analysis of particulate matter
concentrations before, during, and after the implementation of dust suppression
measures.
2.9.6. APPLICATION OF TIME-SERIES ANALYSIS TO DUST SUPPRESSION
Monitoring of Particulate Matter Concentrations.
The time series data of the PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations from air quality
monitoring devices provide records for a time continuum that is irrefutably required
for the determination of dust concentration variability due to some natural causes
such as wind speed, humidity, and other human activities; the quantification of the


effectiveness of dust mitigation methods such as water application and/or chemical
dust suppressants; the understanding of seasonal variability in dust emissions; among
others.
Evaluating Intervention Effectiveness
Time series analysis will, therefore, have the authors assess the dust suppression
interventions for durability and consistency. The major approaches include:
1. Pre- and post-intervention comparison.
✓ Detection of a trend or anomaly by fitting models like ARIMA, or Seasonal
Decomposition of Time Series (STL).
✓ Delineation of time lags between interventions and associated reductions in PM
concentrations.
2. Impact of Environmental Variables
The times-series methodologies have thus far been quite helpful in teasing out the
effect of exogenous factors like wind, temperature, and vehicle traffic itself on dust
suppression performance. Incorporating covariates allows the detection of the
Synergistic or antagonistic action of environmental factors on dust levels with the
optimum application conditions for dust control measures.
Long-term monitoring and evaluation of sustainability
Long-term series help describe the sustainability of the dust mitigation measure; they
are needed when decision-makers want to judge cost-effectiveness through time-i.e.,
eventual needs for reapplication or complementary measures-with a view to attainment
of standards.


VISCOSITY
This refers to the measure of a fluids resistance to deformation or flow therefore it
describes how thick or thin a fluid is and results from internal friction between
molecules i.e. Internal friction within a material that resists motion or how thick a
material is. High viscosity implies greater resistance to flow and low viscosity indicates
that the fluid flows easily without much resistance (white, 2016). The instrument used
to measure viscosity or carry out viscosity tests is a digital viscometer as a certain
concentration of a solution or a fluid is poured into the digital viscometer which gives
a reading in Milli-pascal per second (Munson et al.,2018).
Viscosity involves the fluid’s resistance to flow therefore it further describes how thick
or sticky a fluid is. Viscosity can be high or low hence a highly viscous fluid flows slowly
for example honey and a low viscos fluid flows with ease for example water and this
depends on the internal fiction between molecules in the fluid as they move past each
other (Munson et al., 2013).Viscosity is influenced by factors such as temperature where
heated fluids become less viscous and more viscous when cooled (cengal et al., 2014)
X-FLUORESCENCE METHOD
This is a non-destructive analytical technique used to determine the elemental
composition of materials for example magnesium chloride therefore this indicates the
various compounds present in the magnesium chloride solution for example magnesium
oxide, chlorine ions, manganese (ii) oxide which are vital during dust suppression as
they increase the effectiveness of magnesium chloride during dust suppression through
improving on the binding action of magnesium chloride solution after being
applied(Beckhoff et al.,2006).


COMPOUNDS PRESENT IN MAGNESIUM CHLORIDE SOLUTION
Magnesium oxide
This comprises of relatively a bigger percentage compared to the rest of the compounds
in magnesium chloride as this constitutes of 85.54% which indicates that 85.54% of the
total analyzed mass of magnesium chloride solution was composed of magnesium oxide.
When magnesium chloride is applied along a road section, it absorbs water molecules
from the atmosphere due to tis hygroscopic property and these water molecules react
with the magnesium oxide present 4in magnesium chloride solution forming magnesium
hydroxide which boosts on the binding effect of magnesium chloride solution.
Equation
MgO + H2O Mg(OH)2
This reaction is a neutralization process where the basic oxide i.e. magnesium oxide
dissolves in water to form a slightly soluble hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide is a weakly
soluble in water and often appears as ca white precipitate.
Chlorine ions
These are negatively charged atoms of chlorine that have gained an extra electron and
are commonly found in nature particularly in salts like magnesium chloride (Atkins,
2018). These are smaller ions which have a low charge density and in magnesium
chloride solution, these constitute to a percentage of 4.42% which is also vital as they
also help in attracting water molecules from the atmosphere which boosts on the
binding action of magnesium chloride solution thereby improving on the effectiveness
of magnesium chloride.


However, there are other compounds such as manganese (ii) oxide, silicon dioxide,
calcium oxide etc. constitute the rest of the percentages of magnesium chloride
solution and these help in improving soil stability i.e. soil stabilization and also improves
on the forces which enable attraction of water molecules from the atmosphere which
represents the hygroscopic nature of magnesium chloride solution.















CHAPTER THREE: METHODOLOGY.
3.1. Concentration of particulate matter present in dust on Bbaale-Galilaya road.
Selected different points along the chain age of 0+250m which were 50m away from
each other i.e. 50m, 100m, 150m, 200m and 250m.
Placed the Blatn air quality monitor at a height of 2m from the ground which gave us
various readings of particulate matter at this selected point. This was carried out during
the peak hours of the day i.e. morning and evening and at each point we measured
particulate matter thrice and later got the average for accuracy and repeated the same
procedure for the second time in the evening for three days at each point.
The procedure was repeated for the remaining points and the daily average particulate
matter was noted and recorded for each point along our chain age of Bbaale-Galilaya
road
3.2. Properties of magnesium chloride
X-Fluorescence test. This was carried out using the X-fluorescence method to
determine the elemental composition in magnesium chloride and various compound
were present in magnesium chloride such as magnesium oxide, chlorine ions, iron(ii)
oxide, silicon dioxide, calcium oxide and manganese(ii) oxide with magnesium oxide
and chlorine ions having the highest percentages of 85.45% and 4.42% respectively
Viscosity test. This was carried out using a digital viscometer to measure how thick or
the internal resistance of magnesium chloride solution to motion after being applied
along the road section.


We used 35% weight of magnesium chloride solution so as to minimize on errors due to
air bubbles, to obtain a well-defined ratio of magnesium chloride to water etc. and the
viscometer reading was 20millipascal per second (20mpa s)
3.3. Optimum amount of magnesium chloride needed to suppress dust
Trial runs.
✓ Different magnesium chloride solutions of different weights i.e. 5%, 15%, 20% and
25% were applied at along the chain age of 0+250 at a distance of 0+50m since
the soil was gravel along the Bbaaale-Galilaya road.
✓ A Blatn air quality monitor was later used to measure the new particulate matter
while raised at a distance of 2m from the road surface and this was to ensure
compliance with the environmental protection agency and also to avoid mixture
of dust with other unnecessary materials on the ground.
✓ With comparison with the particulate matter achieved in objective one, the new
particulate matter significantly reduced with the concentration of magnesium
chloride solutions of 5%, 25%, 20% and 25% to 68.9μg/m3, 43.2μg/m3, 28.5μg/m3
24.1μg/m3 and 21.7μg/m3 respectively.
✓ According to the Environmental protection standards of particulate matter, the
magnesium chloride concentration of 15% achieved the EPA compliance with a
particulate matter of 28.5μg/m3 which is below 35μg/m3 .This therefore
indicated a 80% reduction dust along Bbaale-Galilaya road achieving our
optimum amount of magnesium chloride needed for dust suppression along this
road.

All values exceed WHO (15μg/m3) and EPA (35μg/m3) 24-hour guidelines.
Explanation of the graph
Particulate matter gradually increased from 80μg/m3 to 140μg/m3 and this was due to
higher levels of tiny solid particle which were suspended in air along the selected
section of the road from sources such as vehicle emissions, dust etc. and slightly
decreased from 140μg/m3 to 111.165μg/m3 due to reduced levels or fewer tiny solid
particles in air.
Particulate matter monitored along the selected chain age of 0+250m were all above
the standards of Environmental Protection Agency(EPA) and World Health Organization
(WHO) of particulate matter not exceeding 35μ/m3 and 15μ/m3 therefore this indicated
high dust levels along this road due to high concentration of particulate matter.

and manganese (ii) oxide with a composition of 85.45%, 2.70%, 4.42%, 0.623%, 2.11%
and 0.02% respectively.
High percentage of magnesium oxide of 85.45% indicated that out of the total analyzed
sample of magnesium chloride in the laboratory, 85.45% was comprised of magnesium
oxide and this when reacted with the water molecules absorbed by magnesium chloride
due to its hygroscopic nature, it form magnesium hydroxide which help during the
binding action of magnesium chloride since it improves on the water retention capacity
of the chemical during dust suppression ie
MgO(s) + H2O(l) Mg(OH)2(aq)
The high percentage (85.5%) of Magnesium oxide also represents a high hygroscopic
nature hence high moisture retention levels which is the core mechanism behind MgCl2
dust suppressing effect.
Chlorine ions were also present in small quantities of 4.42% elemental composition as
indicated on the graph and these had a low charge density however also play a vital
role during dust suppression as they are inherently hygroscopic which aids in moisture
absorption during dust suppression whereas on the other hand elements such as calcium
oxide, iron(ii)oxide, silicon dioxide and manganese(ii)oxide also help in soil stabilization
during dust suppression which keeps the dust down on the ground thereby preventing
it from becoming airborne



Figure 3 A graph of the viscosity range of magnesium chloride solution
Magnesium chloride solution of (35% weight of MgCl2) had a viscosity of 20mPa.s.
20MPa.s is within acceptable ranges for field application (Wang et al., 2021).the
viscosity value of 20mpas obtained from the digital viscometer lies between the
required standards for field application therefore this indicates that magnesium
chloride spreads with ease after being applied during dust suppression which implies
that at every particular section of the road, dust suppression would be effective due to
the ability to spread or flow easily along the road section

Water reduced dust temporarily for about 1 to 2 hours and dust raised again in air
resulted into a short lived suppression period due to its evaporation within 4 hours and
Magnesium Chloride solution Maintained compliance for 7 days due to its Hygroscopic
and deliquescent properties that enable it to retain moisture from the atmosphere and
bind down the dust particles on the ground.
