aethiopicum has been routinely used as a source of disease resistance genes for several Solanaceae crops, including Solanum
melongena. A lack of genomic resources has meant that breeding of S. aethiopicum has lagged behind other vegetable crops.
Results: We assembled a 1.02-Gb draft genome of S. aethiopicum, which contained predominantly repetitive sequences
(78.9%). We annotated 37,681 gene models, including 34,906 protein-coding genes. Expansion of disease resistance genes
was observed via 2 rounds of amplification of long terminal repeat retrotransposons, which may have occurred ∼1.25 and
3.5 million years ago, respectively. By resequencing 65 S. aethiopicum and S. anguivi genotypes, 18,614,838 single-nucleotide
polymorphisms were identified, of which 34,171 were located within disease resistance genes. Analysis of domestication
and demographic history revealed active selection for genes involved in drought tolerance in both “Gilo” and “Shum”
groups. A pan-genome of S. aethiopicum was assembled, containing 51,351 protein-coding genes; 7,069 of these genes were
missing from the reference genome. Conclusions: The genome sequence of S. aethiopicum enhances our understanding of
its biotic and abiotic resistance. The single-nucleotide polymorphisms identified are immediately available for use by
breeders. The information provided here will accelerate selection and breeding of the African eggplant, as well as other
crops within the Solanaceae family.

Background
The African eggplant, Solanum aethiopicum (NCBI:txid205524), is
an indigenous non-tuberiferous Solanaceae crop that is mainly
grown in tropical Africa [1], especially in Central and West Africa.
S. aethiopicum is hypervariable [2, 3] and is generally classified
into 4 groups: Gilo, Shum, Kumba, and Aculeatum. Gilo is the
most important group and has edible fruits, while Shum has
small and bitter fruits. Kumba is used as a leafy vegetable, while
Aculeatum is used as an ornamental [3, 4] or as rootstock because of its excellent disease resistance [5]. The African eggplant
is reported to have anti-inflammatory activity [6], and its roots
and fruits have been used to treat colic, high blood pressure, and
uterine complications in Africa [6].
Although S. aethiopicum is one of the most important cultivated eggplants in Africa [7, 8], it remains an “orphan crop”
because research and breeding investments are lagging behind other Solanaceae relatives, such as Solanum lycopersicum
(tomato), Solanum tuberosum (potato), and Solanum melongena (edible eggplant). Consequently, there have been few robust genomic resources, such as a well-annotated reference genome.
Genomics-assisted breeding is an effective approach that would
facilitate the breeding of orphan crops such as the African eggplant. Previous attempts to develop molecular markers for S.
aethiopicum, using the S. melongena genome as a reference, have
been unsuccessful because of compromised accuracy [9]. An alternative approach that uses genome editing has been successfully deployed in other Solanaceae crops, including Physalis pruinose [11, 12], but cannot be implemented in S. aethiopicum because of its lack of well-annotated reference genome and gene
sequences.
The African eggplant serves as a gene reservoir for other
economically important crops within the Solanaceae family.
Thanks to its cross-compatibility with S. melongena [4, 10] and
its outstanding resistance to various pathogens, including Fusarium, Ralstonia, and Verticillium [5, 11–13], S. aethiopicum has been
used to develop rootstocks [13] or improve the disease resistance
of S. melongena [14]. Because the genomic basis of resistance in
S. aethiopicum is poorly understood, it can be time-consuming to
use it as a donor in such interspecific crosses. Mapping resistance genes and then developing markers associated with these
genes might resolve this challenge. The development and expansion of resistance genes is usually accompanied by the amplification of long terminal repeat retrotransposons (LTR-Rs). A
typical example is shown in the Solanaceous hot pepper (Capsicum annuum), in which a burst of LTR-Rs substantially mediated the retrotransposition of nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich
repeat-related (NLR) genes, leading to the expansion of resistance genes [15]. LTR-Rs are abundant in plant genomes, including Solanaceae crops such as Nicotiana sylvestris (∼38.16%)
[16], pepper (>70.0%) [17], potato (62.2%) [18], tomato (50.3%) [19],
and petunia (>60%) [20]. The role of LTR-Rs in the S. aethiopicum
genome remains unknown, and whether the resistance seen
in S. aethiopicum is a result of LTR-R amplification remains to
be investigated. The generation of a reference genome for S.
aethiopicum, as well as for other orphan crops, is urgently needed
to advance their research and breeding.
Here, we report a draft whole-genome assembly and annotation for S. aethiopicum. We found 2 amplifications of LTR-Rs
that occurred ∼1.25 and 3.5 million years ago (MYA), resulting
in the expansion of resistance genes. We also resequenced 2
S. aethiopicum groups, “Gilo” and “Shum,” and S. anguivi
at a
high depth (∼60×) and identified 18,614,838 single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs), 34,171 of which are located within resistance genes. Subsequently, we generated a pan-genome of S.
aethopicum. The genomic data provided in this study will greatly
advance research and breeding activities of the African eggplant.
Data Description
We sequenced the genome of S. aethiopicum using a wholegenome shotgun approach. A total of 242.61 Gb raw reads were
generated by sequencing the libraries with insert sizes of 250
and 500 bp, and mate-pair libraries with sizes ranging between
2,000 and 20,000 bp, on an Illumina Hiseq 2000 platform. The
filtered reads used for downstream analysis are shown in Supplementary Table 1. k-mer (k = 17) analysis [21] revealed the S.
aethiopicum genome to be diploid and homozygous, with an estimated genome size of 1.17 Gb (Supplementary Fig. 1). “Clean
reads” amounting to 127.83 Gb (∼109×) were used to assemble
the genome using Platanus [22] (see Methods). A final assembly of 1.02 Gb in size was obtained, containing 162,187 scaffolds
with N50 contig and scaffold values of 25.2 and 516.15 kb (Table 1 and Supplementary Table 2), respectively. Our results reveal that the S. aethiopicum genome is larger than that of other
Solanum genomes, including tomato (0.76 Gb) and potato (0.73
Gb) [18, 19], but it has a comparable guanine-cytosine (GC) ratio
(33.12%) (Supplementary Table 3).
Repetitive elements, predominantly transposable elements
(TEs) (Supplementary Table 4), occupied 811 Mb (78.9%) of the
sequenced genome. Most annotated TEs were retrotransposon elements, including long terminal repeats (LTRs), short
interspersed nuclear elements, and long interspersed nuclear

elements. Together these retrotransposons made up 75.42% of
the assembly. DNA transposons accounting for 2.87% of the
genome were also annotated (Supplementary Table 4).
Protein-coding gene models were predicted by a combination of homologous search and ab initio prediction. The resulting models were pooled to generate a final set of 34,906 proteincoding genes. Predicted gene models were, on average, 3,038 bp
in length, with a mean of 3.15 introns. The mean length of coding sequences, exons, and introns was 1,104, 265, and 613 bp, respectively (Table 1, Supplementary Table 5, Supplementary Fig.
2). As expected, these gene features were similar to those of
other released genomes, including Arabidopsis thaliana [23] and
other Solanaceae crops including S. lycopersicum, S. tuberosum, C.
annuum, and N. sylvestris [16, 18, 19, 24] (Supplementary Table 5).
We further assessed the annotation completeness of this assembly by searching for 1,440 core embryophyta genes (CEGs) with
BUSCO, version 3.0 [25]. We found 80.4% CEGs in this assembly,
with 77.8% being single copies and 2.6% being duplicates (Supplementary Table 6). We also annotated the non-coding genes
by homologous search, leading to the identification of 128 microRNA, 960 transfer RNA (tRNA), 1,185 ribosomal RNA (rRNA),
and 503 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes (Supplementary Table 7).
We annotated 31,863 (91.28%) proteins for their homologous function in several databases. Homologs of 31,099 (89.09%),
26,319 (75.4%), and 20,932 (59.97%) proteins were found in
TrEMBL, InterPro, and SwissProt databases, respectively (Supplementary Table 8). The remaining 3,043 (8.72%) genes encoded
putative proteins with unknown functions.
Analyses
Genome evolution and phylogenetic analysis
By comparing with 4 other sequenced Solanaceae genomes (S.
melongena, S. lycopersicum, S. tuberosum, and C. annuum), 25,751
of the S. aethiopicum genes were clustered into 19,310 families using OrthoMCL (version 2.0) [26], with an average of 1.33
genes each. Single-copy genes shared by these 5 genomes were
concatenated as a supergene representing each genome and
were used to build a phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1A). The split time
between S. aethiopicum and S. melongena was estimated to be
∼2.6 MYA. McScanX [27] identified 182 syntenic blocks. We detected evidence of whole-genome duplication (WGD) events in
this genome by calculating the pairwise synonymous mutation
rates and the rate of 4-fold degenerative third-codon transversion (4DTV) of 1,686 paralogous genes in these blocks. The 4DTV
distribution plot displayed 2 peaks, at ∼0.25 and 1, indicating
2 WGDs (Fig. 1B). The first 1 (peak at 1) represents the ancient
WGD event shared by asterids and rosids [28], while the second
WGD event is shared by Solanaceae plants. This suggests that
its occurrence predates the split of Solanaceae.
Evolution of gene families
OrthoMCL [26] clustering of genes from S. aethiopicum, S. melongena, S. lycopersicum, S. tuberosum, and C. annuum identified
25,751 gene families. Among these, 465 gene families were
unique to S. aethiopicum and 10,166 were common (Supplementary Table 9, Fig. 1C). As expected, the number of shared gene
families decreased as a function of evolutionary distance between S. aethiopicum and the selected species (Supplementary
Table 10). For example, S. aethiopicum shared 15,723 gene families with S. melongena, compared with only 13,461 genes shared
with C. annuum. To further investigate the evolution of gene families, we identified expanded and contracted gene families. Compared with S. melongena, 437 gene families were expanded; most
expanded gene families were found to be involved in biological
processes related to drought or salinity tolerance or disease resistance, including defense response (GO:0006952), response to
oxidative stress ( GO:0006979), glutamate biosynthetic processes
( GO:0006537), and response to metal ions ( GO:0010038) (Supplementary Table 11). No gene families were contracted when
comparing with S. melongena.
Amplification of LTR-Rs
LTR-Rs made up ∼70% of the genome and accounted for 89.31%
of the total TEs in S. aethiopicum (Supplementary Table 4). Consistent with previous studies of LTR-Rs, most LTR-Rs were classified as being in Ty3/Gypsy (82.36% of total LTR-Rs) and Ty1/Copia
(14.90% of total LTR-Rs) subfamilies. The proportion of Ty3/Gypsy
in S. aethiopicum is comparable to that reported in the hot pepper genome (87.7% of Ty3/Gypsy) [24]. To investigate the roles
of LTR-Rs in the evolution of S. aethiopicum, we detected 36,599
full-length LTR-Rs using LTRharvest [29] with the parameters “-
maxlenltr 2000, -similar 75” and LTRdigest software [30]. We further analyzed their evolution, activity, and potential biological
functions.
The age of each LTR-R was inferred by comparing the divergence between the 5′ and 3′ LTR-R, using a substitution rate
of 1.3e−8 year−1 site−1 [31]. Two amplifications of LTR-Rs were
found in S. aethiopicum, while only 1 was detected in tomato and
hot pepper (Fig. 2A). The early amplification occurred at ∼3.5
MYA, coincident with the LTR-R burst found in C. annuum [15]
(Fig. 2A). The second amplification was at 1.25 MYA, coinciding with the LTR-R burst in the tomato genome [19] (Fig. 2A).
Although the time of LTR-Rs amplification is vertically coincident between different species, they occurred separately in each
genome since the ancestor of S. aethiopicum diverged from that
of hot pepper and tomato ∼20 and 4 MYA, respectively (Fig. 1A).
These results imply that environmental stimulators shared between these species during their evolution could have triggered
the amplifications observed. We also estimated the amplification time of Ty3/Gypsy and Ty1/Copia LTR-Rs and found 2 peaks
at ∼1.25 and 3.5 MYA for Gypsy LTR-Rs (Fig. 2B) but only 1 peak
(∼1.25 MYA) for Ty1/Copia LTR-Rs (Fig. 2C). Compared with the
amplification time of Ty3/Gypsy and Ty1/Copia LTR-Rs in differ-

ent species, we observed that the insertion time of Ty1/Copia
LTR-RTs in S. aethiopicum and tomato were earlier than that of
S. melongena and hot pepper. On the contrary, the insertion time
of Ty3/Gypsy LTR-RTs (∼3.5 MYA) in S. aethiopicum was consistent
with the insertion time of hot pepper (Fig. 2B and C).
To investigate the activities of these LTR-Rs, we measured
their expression levels by using RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data
from different tissues (see Methods). Younger LTR-Rs were expressed at higher levels than those of older LTR-Rs. We detected
2 peaks of LTR-R activity, at positions corresponding to the 2
rounds of LTR-R insertions (Fig. 2D–G). The slight shift of the former peaks indicates that the activities degenerated more slowly
than the LTR-R sequences (Fig. 2D–G). The LTR-R activities varied across these tissues. The degeneration of LTR-R activities
was slower in fruits and roots than those in flowers and leaves
(Fig.
2D). This pattern was also confirmed by the varied activity of each LTR-R across these tissues ( Supplementary Fig. 3A ),
implying that these LTR-Rs have different roles in development.

“chitinase

the LTR-R captured genes (Fig.

suggesting that they may be involved in enhancing disease
resistance.
We also analyzed the expression of genes captured by LTR-
Rs. It was intriguing to find that most of these genes were active
in only 1 tissue (Supplementary Fig. 3B). Among these genes, 159
(13.75%), 105 (9.08%), 106 (9.16%), and 129 (11.15%) were specifically and highly expressed in root, leaf, flower, and fruit, respectively. The genes captured by LTR-Rs that were specifically active in leaf tissues were significantly enriched in functions relating to disease resistance (Supplementary Table 13). The biological processes and molecular activities related to disease resistance mentioned above were overrepresented in these genes
(Fig. 3C). The high expression level of resistance genes in leaves
would arm the plant with stronger resistance to pathogens. On
the contrary, these GO terms were not enriched in the genes that
were specifically and highly expressed in leaves. Instead, as expected, “photosynthesis” and “photosystem I” were significantly
overrepresented (Supplementary Table 14). The discrepancy between these 2 gene sets highlights the contribution to resistance
of LTR-R captured genes.
Proteins containing nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat
domains (NB-LRRs) are major components that are responsible for defense against various phytopathogens [32]. The NB-
LRR family is highly expanded in plants, with numbers ranging from <100 to >1,000 [33, 34]. As NB-LRR genes are often colocalized with LTR-Rs [35], we inspected their genomic locations
in the S. aethiopicum genome. Because proteins containing the
nucleotide-binding (NB) site can also confer disease resistance,
we searched for all the NB-containing genes in the genome. As
a result, we identified 447 NB-containing genes in the genome,
among which 62 (13.9%) NB-containing genes co-localized
with LTR-Rs were identified as LTR-R captured genes. The

Polymorphisms in different S. aethiopicum groups
We resequenced 60 S. aethiopicum genotypes in 2 major groups,
Gilo and Shum, and 5 accessions of S. anguivi, the progenitor of S. aethiopicum [36]. We generated ∼60 Gb raw data (60×)
(Supplementary Table 20) and identified 18,614,838 SNPs and
1,999,241 indels, with an average of 3,530,488 SNPs for each
accession (Supplementary Table 16). On average, there were
18,090 SNPs and 1,943 indels per megabase. Among them,
424,509 (2.06%), 815,217 (3.95%), and 19,374,353 (93.99%) were
located in exons, introns, and intergenic regions, respectively
(Table 2). There were 267,710 SNPs that resulted in amino acid
sequence changes by introducing new start codons, premature
stop codons, or nonsynonymous substitutions (Table 2). We also
identified 1,255,302 structural variations (SVs). Of the detected
indels, 177,711 (8.89%) were located in genic regions, among
which 2,977 caused frameshift changes and, therefore, resulted
in amino acid sequence changes that may have led to gene malfunctions. Furthermore, 106,377 SVs were identified in genic regions, including 53,736 (50.51%) deletions, 34,368 (32.31%) insertions, and 8,872 (8.34%) duplications.
On counting the SNPs and indels in each group, we found
12,777,811, 15,165,053 and 8,557,818 SNPs in “Gilo,” “Shum,” and
“S. anguivi,” respectively, accounting for 68.64%, 81.47%, and
45.97% of the total SNPs, respectively. There were 2,019,539
(10.85%), 4,747,418 (25.50%), and 587,885 (3.16%) SNPs unique to
Gilo, Shum, and S. anguivi, respectively (Fig. 4A). Most (93.13%)
SNPs in S. anguivi were shared with either Gilo or Shum (Fig. 4A),
which is in line with the fact that S. anguivi is the ancestor [36].
Similarly, 92.62% of the indels identified in S. anguivi were also
shared with Gilo or Shum (Fig. 4B).
Nucleotide diversity (π) of all the genotypes was determined to be 3.58 × 10−3 for whole genomes, 2.06 × 10−3 for
genic regions, and 3.75 × 10−3 for intergenic regions. Nucleotide
diversity for each genotype revealed lower diversity for Gilo
(S. anguivi: 3.16 × 10−3, Shum: 3.65 × 10−3, and Gilo: 2.55 ×
10−3, respectively). Linkage disequilibrium (LD) estimation using Haploview (version 4.2) [37] revealed that r2 reached the half
maximum value at ∼150 kb (Fig. 4C), which is smaller than in
other Solanaceae crops, e.g., tomato (2,000 kb) [38]. Because S.
aethiopicum has been routinely used to improve disease resistance in eggplant and other Solanaceaee crops [14], we further
identified SNPs that were strongly associated with resistance
genes by selecting those lying within resistance genes. A total
of 34,171 SNPs were finally selected, which could be used in the
selection of Solanaceae plants with disease resistance (Supplementary Table 16).
Population structure and demography of S. aethiopicum
To investigate the evolution and population demography of S.
aethiopicum, we first built a maximum-likelihood (Fig. 5A, Supplementary Fig. 4) phylogenetic tree using the full set of SNPs.
We observed population structure in the genome-wide diversity.
As anticipated, the accessions from Gilo and Shum were clearly
separated in the tree, with only 1 exception in each group, probably caused by labelling errors. On the other hand, accessions
of S. anguivi, the known ancestor of S. aethiopicum, did not cluster separately, but grouped with either Gilo or Shum. This structure was also supported by principal component analysis (PCA),
which clearly separated these accessions into 2 clusters (Fig. 5B,
Supplementary Fig. 5).
The domestication history of S. aethiopicum was inferred by
constructing a multilevel population structure using ADMIX-
TURE [39]. This enabled us to estimate the maximum-likelihood
ancestry (Fig. 5A). The parameter K, representing the number of
subgroups to be divided, was set in the range of 2–9, and the
cross-validation (CV) error was calculated individually. The CV
error converged to 0.4375 when K = 6, suggesting the division of
the resequenced accessions into 6 subgroups: I–VI (Fig. 5A). The
structure changes with increasing K-value from 2 to 6, showing a
time-lapse domestication history of S. aethiopicum that was first
split into 2 groups, Gilo and Shum. The former was subsequently
divided into subgroups I and II. Two groups emerged in Shum
when K = 3, each of which was then divided into 2 subgroups
when K = 6. In summary, Gilo was divided into 2 subgroups (I
and II) and Shum was divided into 4 subgroups (III–VI).
The demographic history of S. aethiopicum was inferred using
the pairwise sequential Markovian coalescent model [40]. By doing this, we inferred changes in the effective population sizes of
S. aethiopicum (Fig. 5C). Our data revealed distinct demographic
trends from 10,000 to 100 years ago, in which a bottleneck was
shown ∼4,000–5,000 years ago, followed by an immediate expansion of population size. The great population expansion might
be associated with the early domestication of S. aethiopicum in
Africa because it coincides with human population growth in
western Africa, also occurring 4,000–5,000 years ago [41].
Artificially selected genes in S. aethiopicum
We used reduce of diversity (ROD) and fixation index-statistics
(Fst) measures to detect artificially selected regions along the
genome. Briefly, ROD and Fst were calculated in a sliding nonoverlap 10-kb window. Regions with ROD > 0.75 and Fst >
0.15 were identified as candidate regions under selection. As
a result, genomic regions of 3,238 and 1,062 windows were
found to be under selection during the domestication of Gilo
and Shum, respectively (Supplementary Table 17). Among them,
161 windows were common between these 2 groups, while
3,077 and 901 windows were unique to Gilo and Shum, respectively. Genes located within these regions were identified as selected genes. Thirty-six and 1,406 selected genes were identified in Shum and Gilo, respectively, and 12 of these genes were

(10.85%%), 4,747,418 (25.50%), and 587,885 (3.16%) were unique to Gilo, Shum, and S. anguivi, respectively. Most (93.13%) of SNPs in S. anguivi were shared with either
Gilo or Shum. (B) Indels amounting to 14.06%, 28.96%, and 2.76% were unique to Gilo, Shum, and S. anguivi, respectively, and, like the SNP statistics in these groups,

selected in both. Ten of the 12 genes were annotated in the
SwissProt database with known functions and included many
genes known to be involved in tolerance to unfavorable environmental stresses, such as autophagy-related gene 18f (ATG18f),
ATP-binding cassette transporter B (ABCB18), lysine–tRNA ligase (LYSRS), acyl-coenzyme A oxidase 4 (ACX4), inositol hexakisphosphate and diphosphoinositol-pentakisphosphate kinase
(VIP2) (Supplementary Table 18). For example, ATG18 is reported
to be involved in defense response to powdery mildew fungus
through autophagy in Arabidopsis [42]; it is also involved in response to nutrition starvation by serving as an accessory component to ATG1/13 kinase complex [43]. ABCB is reported to be
associated with lipid transport and confers tolerance to heavy
metal ions, such as aluminium [44], cadmium, and lead [45].
The expression of LYSRS has been shown to be specifically induced in tomato root during the unusual accumulation of metal
ions [46]. VIP2 is reported to be critical in myo-inositol phosphate signalling pathways, and is known to be involved in responses to drought and salt stresses [47]. Furthermore, 2 genes
encoding pentatricopeptide repeat-containing protein were also
found among these genes, suggesting that RNA editing may have
played a crucial role in the domestication of S. aethiopicum [48].
GO enrichment analysis showed that genes selected in both the
Gilo and Shum groups were enriched in “transport” (Supplementary Table 19). GO terms for “response to auxin,” “response
to hormone,” “response to salt stress” and “response to water”

immediate expansion of population size.
were also overrepresented in genes selected either in Gilo or
Shum only. This result could explain the enhanced tolerance to
drought and salinity in S. aethiopicum.
We also focused on the diversity of genes co-localized with
LTR-Rs. A total of 24,682 SNPs were located within these colocalized genes, corresponding to 0.133% of the total number
of SNPs (18,614,838). This is substantially fewer than would be
expected if SNPs were evenly distributed across all genes, particularly because the LTR-R co-localized genes comprise 3.31%
of the total gene set. The repellant of SNPs in these genes suggests purifying selection, which was also supported by the large
amount (9,728; 39.41%) of rare SNPs (minor allele frequency <5%)
found among the co-localized genes. We also observed that
nonsynonymous SNPs (9,544) were much more abundant than
synonymous ones (5310) among the co-localized genes. These
variations led to amino acid changes in the encoded proteins,
which may have contributed to the diversification of resistance
genes.
Pan- and core-genome of S. aethiopicum
Gene content varies across different accessions. A single reference assembly is insufficient to include all S. aethiopicum genes.
Therefore, we assembled contigs for individual accessions using
pair-end reads, with coverages ranging from 30 to 60× (Supplementary Table 20).
We assembled the genomes individually using SOAPdenovo2
[49] and filtered out contigs smaller than 2 kb. As a result, 753,084
contigs were retained, among which 432,785 were from Shum,
260,119 were Gilo and 60,180 were from S. anguivi. These contigs were further pooled separately and cleaned by removing duplicates using CD-HIT [50]. This led to the retention of 97,429,
76,638, and 36,915 contigs for Shum, Gilo and S. anguivi, respectively. The annotation of these contigs resulted in 41,626, 33,194,
and 17,662 protein-coding genes, among which we identified accessory gene sets of 29,389, 23,726, and 12,829 for Shum, Gilo,
and S. anguivi, respectively, by comparing against the reference
genome sequence. We generated a pan-genome of S. aethiopicum
(including Shum, Gilo and S. anguivi groups) of 51,351 genes
(Supplementary Table 21). These genes were further clustered
together with those annotated in the reference using CD-HIT.
Overall, we identified 7,069 genes unique to the pan-genome
gene set, suggesting that they had been missed from the reference. The average length of accessory genes was 1.62 kb with
2.22 introns. This is comparable to gene models in the reference
genome, providing further evidence of accurate annotation. We
further assigned their putative functions by querying against
protein databases. A total of 48,572 (94.59%) genes were fully annotated and functional descriptions (Supplementary Table 22)
provided. Among the identified gene models, 10,409 (20.27%)
were common to these 3 groups and were thus defined as “core”
genes. As expected, they were mainly composed of housekeeping genes (Supplementary Table 23). However, it is important
to note that the number of core genes may have been underestimated because S. anguivi was underrepresented, while the
other 2 S. aethiopicum groups, Kumba and Aculeatum, were not
included in the present study.
Discussion
Solanum aethiopicum is cross-compatible with S. melongena and
is routinely used as a donor of disease resistance genes to its
close relative [14]. Genomic analysis of S. aethiopicum revealed
higher LTR-mediated expansion of resistance gene families than
its other close relatives, including tomato, potato, eggplant, and
hot pepper. LTR amplification is one of the major forces driving
genome evolution. It shapes the genome by capturing, interrupting, or flanking genes [51]. The consequences of LTR insertions

depend on the genomic position of insertion. For example, inserting into protein-coding sequences results in pseudogenization. LTR-Rs adjacent to protein-coding genes can downregulate
or silence the expression of flanking genes by extending methylation regions or by producing antisense transcripts [52–55]. LTR-
Rs also mediate gene retroposition, capturing genes back into
the genome [51]. In the present study, LTRs preferentially captured genes related to disease resistance, resulting in the overrepresentation of GO terms related to disease resistance in the
LTR-captured genes. Enrichment of the GO terms “chitin binding (GO:0008061)” and “chitinase activity (GO:0006032)” (Fig. 3B,
Supplementary Table 12) implies that these genes may have
been selected to resist infection by fungal pathogens, such as
Fusarium oxysporum [56]. On the contrary, no GO term enrichment was seen in genes that were disrupted by LTR-Rs. This suggests that gene disruption by LTR-Rs may be a random event in
terms of gene function. The age distribution of LTR-R captured
genes coincidently fit with that of the LTR-R–disrupted genes,
suggesting that these 2 events may have occurred simultaneously (Fig. 3A). It is not clear why genes related to disease resistance were favoured by LTR-Rs, but one explanation is that
the disease resistance genes may have been more active than
other genes at the time of LTR retrotransposition. The expression pattern of LTR-R captured genes also varied between tissues. Those related to resistance were specifically active in the
leaf, while those engaged in the transport of cations, nitrogen,
and cell proliferation were active in flowers. This outcome suggests low abundance of transcripts for disease resistance genes,
resulting in a relatively low chance to adequately capture the
genes in flowers under normal conditions. Another possible scenario is that LTR retrotransposition occurred under stress conditions, which resulted in the simultaneous induction of the expression of resistance genes in gametes and the activity of LTR
retrotransposition. Such possible stresses might be extreme environmental conditions or pathogen infection. A “reinforcement
model” has been proposed to explain the simultaneous accumulation of stress-responsive genes and the activity of retrotransposons in genomes under environmental stress [57, 58].
There are 4 major groups of S. aethiopicum: “Gilo,” “Shum,”
“Kumba,” and “Aculeatum.” We resequenced accessions from
the Gilo and Shum groups, which are widely consumed as vegetables. The accessions resequenced in this study were clustered
into 6 subgroups (4 for Shum and 2 for Gilo). By scanning for regions with lower genomic diversity, we identified regions and
several genes involved in responses to salt, water, and drought
tolerance that were under selection during the domestication
of S. aethiopicum. Furthermore, purification selection was also
found among disease resistance genes.
In the present study, resequencing S. aethiopicum and S. anguivi genomes at a high depth (30–60×) (Supplementary Table
20) enabled us to assemble draft genomes for these individuals.
Despite resequencing only a few genotypes from the 2 groups,
we intend to supplement the reference gene set with accessory
genes by pooling the resequenced contigs for gene prediction
and annotation. This “pan-genome” is expected to provide a
more comprehensive understanding of S. aethiopicum in the future.
We report a reference genome for African eggplant, which
will provide a basic data resource for further genomic research and breeding activities for S. aethiopicum. The gene sequences annotated in the genome will be essential for developing genome editing vectors to create mutants to further understand the functions of genes within the genome and develop superior genotypes. Molecular markers developed using
the genome sequences will also enable more efficient and precise selection of superior accessions by breeders.
Methods
DNA extraction, library construction and sequencing,
and genome assembly
High molecular weight genomic DNA was extracted from young
leaves of 14-day-old seedlings of Solanum aethiopicum “Shum” accession 303, which had been previously and repeatedly selfed to
ensure homozygosity. Shum 303 is a selection of African eggplant from Uganda, with green fruits and pigmented stem and
leaf veins. DNA was extracted using a modified cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) protocol, as previously described
[59]. Briefly, 2.5 g fresh leaf tissue was flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground to a fine powder, before adding 15 mL of 2×
extraction buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1.4 M NaCl, 20 mM
EDTA, 2% w/v CTAB, 10 μL/mL β-mercaptoethanol), then incubated at 65◦C. One volume of chloroform: isoamyl alcohol (24:1)
was added and mixed and the sample was centrifuged twice.
The aqueous phase was precipitated overnight and the washed
pellet was treated with RNaseA. A repeat chloroform extraction
was performed, as above, to remove RNaseA and any other contaminants. The aqueous phase was collected and DNA was precipitated and washed with ethanol. DNA was allowed to dry,
then was resuspended in 100 μL elution buffer.
High molecular weight DNA was fragmented and used to
construct paired-end libraries with insert sizes of 250 bp, 500 bp,
2 kb, 6 kb, 10 kb, and 20 kb, following standard Illumina protocols. The libraries were sequenced on an Illlumina HiSeq 2000
platform, resulting in a total of 242.61 Gb raw reads. Filtering
of duplicated, low-quality reads and reads with adaptors was
done using SOAPfilter (version 2.2, an application included in
the SOAPdenovo2 package, RRID:SCR 014986) [49] with the parameters “-M 2, -f 0, -p”. Reads with ≥40% low-quality bases or
with ≥10% uncalled bases (“N”) were filtered. We used 17 k-mer
counts [21] of high-quality reads from small insert libraries to
evaluate the genome size and heterozygosity using GCE [60] and
Kmergenie [61]. We assembled the genome using Platanus (Platanus, RRID:SCR 015531) [22].
Genomic DNA used for resequencing was extracted from
young leaves of 65 accessions. DNA was sheared into small fragments of ∼200 bp and used to construct paired-end libraries,
following standard BGI protocols as previously described [62],
and subsequently sequenced on a BGI-500 sequencer. Briefly, the
DNA fragments were ligated to BGISEQ-500 compatible adaptors, followed by an index PCR amplification, the products of
which were then pooled and circularized for sequencing on the
BGISEQ-500 (BGI, Shenzhen, China). Ultra-deep data were produced for each accession, with coverage ranging from ∼45 to
∼75× (Supplementary Table 20).
RNA extraction, library construction, and sequencing
For RNA extraction, seeds of Gilo and Shum inbred lines were
obtained from Uganda Christian University. The seeds were
planted in a screenhouse at the BecA-ILRI Hub (Nairobi, Kenya)
in polyvinylchloride pots (13 cm height and 11.5 cm diameter)
containing sterile forest soil and farmyard manure (2:1). The
seedlings were later transplanted into larger polyvinylchloride
pots of 21 cm height and 14 cm diameter. Plants were raised in
a screenhouse at 21–23◦C and 11–13◦C day and night temperatures, respectively (average 12 light hours per day). The plants

were regularly watered to maintain moisture at required capacity.
Two plants were selected randomly from each of Gilo and
Shum accessions and were tagged at the seedling stage for tissue
sampling. Fresh tissues were sampled from each of the tagged
plants and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately. Total
RNA was extracted from the frozen tissues using the ZR Plant
RNA MiniprepTM Kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA integrity was evaluated by electrophoresis in denaturing agarose gel (1% agarose,
5% formamide, 1× TAE) stained with 3× GelRed (Biotium, Fremont, CA, USA). RNA was quantified using the Qubit RNA Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) was removed from 4 μL of total RNA from
each sample using the Epicentre Ribo-zeroTM rRNA Removal
Kit (Epicentre, Madison, WI, USA). The rRNA-depleted RNA was
then used to generate strand-specific RNA-seq libraries using
TruSeq R⃝Stranded mRNA Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA).
Twenty mRNA libraries were prepared, multiplexed (10 samples
at a time), and sequenced as paired-end reads on the MiSeq (Illumina, San Diego, USA) platform at the BecA-ILRI Hub. Similar to the process of filtering genomic reads, SOAPfilter software [49] was used, with the parameters “-M 2, -f 0, -p” to filter low-quality reads and adaptor sequences. Reads with ≥40%
low-quality bases or with ≥10% uncalled bases (“N”) were filtered
out.
Repeat annotation
Tandem repeats were searched in the genome using TRF, version 4.04 [63]. Transposable elements (TEs) were identified by a
combination of homology-based and de novo approaches. Briefly,
the assembly was aligned to a known repeats database (Repbase16.02) using RepeatMasker (RRID:SCR 012954) and Repeat-
ProteinMask (version 3.2.9) [64] at both the DNA and protein
level. In the de novo approach, RepeatModeler (version 1.1.0.4,
RRID:SCR 015027) [65] was used to build a de novo repeat library
using the S. aethiopicum assembly, in which redundancies were
filtered out. TEs in the genome were then identified by Repeat-
Masker [64]. LTRs were identified using LTRharvest [29], with the
criterion of 75% similarity on both sides. LTRdigest [30] was used
to identify the internal elements of LTR-Rs with the eukaryotic
tRNA library [66]. Identified LTR-Rs including intact poly purine
tracts and primer binding sites with LTR-Rs on both sides were
considered to be the final intact LTR-Rs. These were then classified into superfamilies, Gypsyand Copia, by querying against Repbase 16.02 [67].
Annotation of gene models and ncRNA
Gene models were predicted using a combination of de novo prediction, homology search, and RNA-aided annotation. Augustus software (RRID:SCR 008417) [68] was used to perform de novo
prediction after the annotated repeats were masked in the assembly. To search for homologous sequences, protein sequences
of 4 closely related species (S. lycopersicum, S. tuberosum, Capsisum annuum, and Nicotiana sylvestris), together with Arabidopsis thaliana, were used as query sequences to search the reference genome sequence using TBLASTN (RRID:SCR 011822) [69]
with the e-value ≤1e−5. Regions mapped by these query sequences were subjected to GeneWise (RRID:SCR 015054) [70], together with their flanking sequences (1,000 bp) to identify the
positions of start/stop codons and splicing. For RNA-aided annotation, RNA-seq data from different tissues of S. aethiopicum were
mapped to the genome assembly of S. aethiopicum using HISAT
(RRID:SCR 015530) [71]. Mapped reads were then assembled using StringTie (RRID:SCR 016323) [72]. GLEAN software [73] was
used to integrate mapped transcripts from different sources to
produce a consensus gene set. tRNAscan-SE (RRID:SCR 010835)
[74] was performed to search for reliable tRNA positions. snRNA
and miRNA were detected by searching the reference sequence
against the Rfam database (RRID:SCR 007891) [75] using BLAST
[69]. rRNAs were detected by aligning with BLASTN (RRID:SC
R 004870) [69] against known plant rRNA sequences [76]. For
functional annotation, protein sequences were searched against
Swissprot, TrEMBL, KEGG (release 88.2), InterPro, Gene Ontology,
COG, and Non-redundant protein NCBI databases [77–82].
Gene family analysis
Proteins of S. aethiopicum, S. tuberosum (PGSC v3.4) [18], S. lycopersicum (v2.3) [19], C. annuum (PGA v.1.6) [24], and S. melongena
(Sme2.5.1) [83] were selected to perform all-against-all comparisons using BLASTP (RRID:SCR 001010) [69], with an e-value cutoff of ≤1e−5. OrthoMCL (RRID:SCR 007839) [26] and the default
MCL inflation parameter of 1.5 were used to define the gene
families. Single-copy families were selected to perform multiple sequence alignment using MAFFT (RRID:SCR 011811) [84].
Four-fold degenerate sites were picked and used to construct a
phylogenetic tree based on the maximum-likelihood method by
PhyML (RRID:SCR 014629) [85], with C. annuum as the outgroup.
WGD analysis was achieved by identifying colinearity blocks by
paralog gene pairs in MCscanX, with default parameters [27].
Each aligned paralog gene pair was concatenated to a supersequence in 1 colinearity block and 4dTv (transversion of 4-fold
degenerate site) values of each block were calculated. We also
determined the distribution of 4DTv values to estimate the speciation between species or WGD events. The divergence time of
S. aethiopicum was estimated using the MCMCtree program [86],
with the constructed phylogenetic trees and the divergence time
of C. annuum [24] and S. tuberosum [18].
Analysis of LTR-Rs
Insertion times of identified, intact LTR-Rs were estimated on
the basis of the sequence divergence between the 5′ and 3′ LTR
of each element. The nucleotide distance K between 1 pair of
LTR-Rs was calculated using the Kimura 2-parameter method
in Distmat (EMBOSS package) [87]. An average base substitution
rate of 1.3e−8 [31] was used to estimate the insertion time, based
on the following formula:
T = K /2r [15].
Transcriptomic data were used to analyse the activity of intact LTR-Rs. After filtering and removing low-quality reads, highquality reads from each were mapped against the full-length
LTR-R sequence using BWA-MEM software [88], with default parameters. Expression levels of intact LTR-Rs were calculated using EdgeR [89] and visually presented using pheatmap in R [90].
Analysis of NB-containing genes
NB domain-containing genes in the S. aethiopicum genome were
identified using a method previously described [15, 91]. Briefly,
the hidden Markov model (HMM) profile of the NB-ARC domain
(PF00931) was used as a query to perform an HMMER search (version 3.2.1, RRID:SCR 005305 [92]) against protein sequences of
tomato, potato, hot pepper [18, 19, 24], and annotated sequences

of S. aethiopicum, with an e-value cut-off of ≤1e−60. Aligned
NB-ARC domain sequences of S. aethiopicum were extracted and
used to build the S. aethiopicum–specific HMM model. NB-ARC domain sequences of tomato, potato, and hot pepper were mapped
as the query sequences against the S. aethiopicum genome using TBLASTN [69], with an e-value cut-off of ≤1e−4 using GeneWise software [70] to identify candidate NB-containing genes
at the whole-genome level. Final NB-containing genes were confirmed by searching the genome with an S. aethiopicum–specific
NB-ARC HMM model, constructed with an e-value cut-off of
≤1e−4. Retroduplicated NLRs were identified according to the
method described by Kim et al. (2017) [15]. Phylogenetic trees for
S. aethiopicum and S. melongena NB-containing genes were constructed using FastTree (RRID:SCR 015501) [93], with default parameters.
SNP calling
The GATK pipeline (RRID:SCR 001876) [94] was used to call
SNPs and indels. Briefly, low-quality, duplicated, and adaptorcontaminated reads were filtered using SOAPfilter (version 2.2)
[49] before further processing. To reduce the compute time, scaffolds in the assembly were sequentially linked into 24 pseudochromosomes, in which the original scaffolds were separated by
100 Ns, before mapping reads using BWA (RRID:SCR 010910) [88],
with default parameters. Picard Tools [95] and SAMtools (RRID:
SCR 002105) [96] were used to further process the alignment outputs, including sorting and marking of duplicates. After alignment and sorting, the GATK pipeline (version 4.0.11.0) was used
to call SNPs by sequentially implementing the following modules: RealignerTargetCreator, IndelRealigner, UnifiedGenotyper,
samtools mpileup, VariantFiltration, BaseRecalibrator, Analyze-
Covariates, PrintReads, and HaplotypeCaller, with default parameters. This pipeline produced a file in gvcf format, which displayed the called SNPs and indels filtered according to genotype
information. The file was then analysed using PLINK software
[97] for quality control, with “GENO>0.05, MAF<0.1, HWE test
p-value ≤0.0001” parameters (GENO: maximum per-SNP missing; MAF: minor allele frequency; HWE: Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium P-value). The loci of these SNPs and indels were anchored back to the original scaffolds and annotated using SnpEff
[98]. To identify structural variations (SVs), sample information
was added using AddOrReplaceReadGroups, a module of Picardtools, and SVs were detected using DiscoverVariantsFromContigAlignmentsSAMSpark, a GATK module.
Population analysis
A maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree was constructed,
based on the genotypes at all the SNP loci using FastTree [93],
with default parameters. To perform PCA, Beagle4.1 [99] was
used to impute the unphased genotypes. All imputed and identified genotypes at SNP loci were pooled and finalized using PLINK
[97] and ReSeqTools [100], which were then subjected to PCA using GCTA software [101]. The population was clustered using AD-
MIXTURE software [39], with K (the expected number of clusters)
increasing from 2 to 9. The K value with the minimum crossvalidation error was eventually selected.
Genome-wide linkage disequilibrium (LD) was calculated for
populations of different groups using Haploview [102] in windows of 2,000 kb. Briefly, the correlation coefficient (r2) between
SNP pairs in a non-overlapping sliding 1-kb bin was calculated
and then averaged within bins.
Candidate regions under selection were identified by comparing polymorphism levels—measured by ROD, as well as by
FST—between Gilo, Shum, and Solanum anguivi groups. ROD was
calculated using the formula
ROD = 1 −πcul/πwild,
where πcul and πwild denote the nucleotide diversity within the
cultivated and wild populations, respectively.
FST measurement was calculated according to the formula
FST = (πbetween −πwithin) /πbetween,
where πbetween and πwithin represent the average number of pairwise differences between 2 individuals sampled from different
or the same population.
Construction of pan- and core-genome
To build a gene set including as many S. aethiopicum genes as possible, we assembled contigs of all 65 resequenced accessions individually using SOAPdenovo2 [49]. The assembled contigs from
each group (Gilo, Shum, and S. anguivi) were then merged. CD-
HIT-EST [50] was used to eliminate redundancy and generate the
final dataset of pan-genomes for each group. Similarly, all these
contigs were merged into a pan-genome of S. aethiopicum. Gene
models were predicted from these contigs as described above
and their functions were also annotated.
Availability of supporting data and materials
The raw sequence data from our genome project were deposited
in the NCBI SRA with BioProject number PRJNA523664 and in the
