Lake Victoria, the world’s largest tropical freshwater lake, supports critical
ecological, economic and social functions across East Africa. However, increasing
industrial pollution, particularly in Walukuba Masese (Jinja district), poses a serious
threat. The uncontrolled discharge of untreated effluent especially from the sunbelt
textile industry has led to elevated phosphorous levels, causing eutrophication,
harmful algal blooms and aquatic degradation.
This study investigates the use of iron oxide and silica, as a sustainable method for
phosphorous removal from industrial waste water. Laboratory experiments assessed
adsorption efficiency based on parameters such as contact time, adsorbent dosage,
Ph, and initial phosphorous concentration. The adsorption mechanism relies on Fe-
O-P bond formation, where phosphates ions interact with hydroxyl groups on iron
oxide surfaces. Silica enhances this process by increasing surface area structural
stability.
Finding reveals that the iron oxide and silica combination offers a cost effective and
environmentally sustainable alternative to conventional treatment methods.
Significant reductions in phosphorous levels were observed, demonstrating the
potential of this system to meet regulatory standards and protect Lake Victoria’s
aquatic ecosystem. This research highlights the importance of adopting innovative,
efficient wastewater treatment technologies for long term water resource
sustainability.

CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION
This chapter entails relevant information about the project, problem statement,
objectives of the study, purpose of the study, justification and the scope of the
study.
1.1. BACKGROUND
Lakes provide essential ecological, social and economic benefits. Lake Victoria, the
largest tropical fresh water lake plays a key role in supporting industries, fishing,
agriculture and recreation of East Africa region, contributing to the Gross National
Product (GNP) of a nation (Ndugga, 2021). The area surrounding Lake Victoria,
specifically the Walukuba Masese landing site in Jinja District, is highly
industrialized and densely populated, with a high proportion of the population living
alongside the lake (Hussein, 2023). The industries in the lake's catchment area
include fish processing, food and beverage, pharmaceuticals, plastics, mattresses,
metal fabricating industries and textile industries. Careless disposal of industrial
effluents and other waste materials has led to significant water pollution,
particularly increasing the concentration of nutrients in the lake’s waters, primarily
from sunbelt textile industry.
Industrial pollution in Uganda is rising, posing a significant environmental risk.
Pollution emitted by industries is one of the key contributors to the deterioration of
water quality in the country. The availability and quality of water are directly linked
to the quality of life, with water quality often reflecting the state of economic
development. Groundwater and surface water bodies can be contaminated by
several sources. In urban areas, careless disposal of industrial effluents and other
wastes significantly contributes to poor water quality (Tariq & Mushtaq, 2023). Most

of the water bodies in developing regions are polluted by untreated effluents
discharged from industries (Chowdhary, Bhargava, Mishra, & Khan, 2020).
Parts of Lake Victoria along the areas of walukuba masese in jinja district receive
untreated effluents from surrounding industries, which have significantly degraded
the water quality. These industries discharge waste into the lake almost without any
adequate treatment, resulting in high concentrations of nutrients like phosphorous.
This poses severe threats to both aquatic life and human health, leading to problems
such as eutrophication, harmful algal blooms, loss of biodiversity, groundwater
contamination, and acidification of the water (Taako & Andama, 2024). This
research aims to assess the use of iron oxide nano bio-adsorbent to remove nutrients
from waste water.
1.2. PROBLEM STATEMENT
Pollution due to increased urban development has taken a toll on the fresh water
ecosystems especially the proximal fresh water ecosystems, contributing to their
deterioration, destruction and loss. Parts of Lake Victoria along the areas of
walukuba masese in jinja district are affected by pollution from human activities
like industrialization, sewage disposal among others (Marriott and Humphrey ,2023
). Lake victoria faces a significant challenge from the industrial effluents from
the sunbelt industry, a leather tanning industry. These have high nutrient
concentrations especially phosphorous in the water (Walakira and Okot-Okumu,
2023). Recent studies have revealed that the phosphorous concentration in some
parts of lake Victoria along the areas of walukuba masese landing sites exceed
permissible levels with an average concentration of 35.67 mg/L which is way above

the concentration standards of NEMA which are set at 10mg/L (ministry of water and
environment, 2023).
High phosphorous concentration in the effluent and subsequent catchment poses
severe threats to both aquatic life and human health, in terms of eutrophication
and harmful algal blooms. These impact the biodiversity, ground water
contamination, acidification of the water, among others. The current situation
calls for urgent attention to mitigate the adverse impacts of increased nutrient
concentrations on the ecosystems and safeguard the health and wellbeing of the
people in the mentioned catchment areas inclusive of those directly benefiting
from the lake. This research aims at assessing the use of iron oxide and silica in
industrial wastewater treatment.
1.3. OBJECTIVES
1.3.1. Main Objective

1.3.2. Specific objectives
1. To determine the Physicochemical parameters of the wastewater effluent
2. Assessing the performance of iron oxide and silica in phosphorous removal from
wastewater.
3. To design a wastewater treatment system for the wastewater effluent using
iron oxide and silica.
1.4. RESEARCH QUESTIONS
1. What are the Physicochemical parameters of the wastewater effluent?
2. What is the performance of iron oxide and silica in phosphorous removal from
wastewater.

3. How will the wastewater treatment system be designed?
1.5. GEOGRAPHICAL SCOPE
Sunbelt textile industries located along walukuba and masese landing sites in Jinja
district.
1.6. JUSTIFICATION
The discharge of untreated industrial wastewater into aquatic ecosystems, such as
lakes like Lake Victoria, poses significant health risks to communities that depend
on these water sources. Elevated phosphorus levels in such effluents are a primary
contributor to eutrophication, leading to detrimental effects like algal blooms,
oxygen depletion, and degradation of water quality. Therefore, it is imperative to
reduce phosphorus concentrations in wastewater to meet environmental discharge
standards and protect aquatic ecosystems (Frankel,2022).
Iron oxide-based bio-adsorbents have emerged as a promising solution for
phosphorus removal from wastewater. Their high surface area and abundance of
active sites facilitate effective adsorption of phosphate ions. The mechanism
involves the formation of hydroxyl groups on the iron oxide surface in aqueous
environments, which interact with phosphate ions through ligand exchange
reactions. This process results in the displacement of surface hydroxyl groups by
phosphate, forming stable Fe–O–P bonds, thereby effectively removing phosphorus
from the water.
To enhance the adsorption capacity of iron oxides, it is incorporated with bioadsorbents like silica. Silica increases the overall surface area and reactivity of the
composite material, providing additional active sites for pollutant binding. This

synergistic effect leads to higher adsorption capacities, making the composite
material more efficient in removing contaminants from wastewater.
1.7. Adsorption Mechanism of Phosphorus
Iron oxides (Fe2O3 or Fe3O4) are known to have a high affinity for phosphate ions
due to their surface charge and the ability to undergo ligand exchange reactions. In
the presence of water, iron oxide surfaces become hydroxylated, forming –OH groups
that can interact with phosphate ions (PO43−) in solution. The phosphate ions
displace hydroxyl groups on the surface of the iron oxide particles, forming Fe–O–P
bonds.
Fe-OHs+ H2PO4−aq→ Fe-O-PO42−s+ H2Ol
Phosphate ions bond with the iron oxide's hydroxyl groups, leading to the formation
of inner-sphere complexes:
Fe(OH)3s+ PO43−aq → FePO4s + 3OH− aq
This mechanism allows for strong binding of phosphorus onto the iron oxide surface,
effectively reducing its concentration in wastewater. The silica component of iron
oxide further enhances this adsorption due to its increased surface area and
reactivity, leading to higher adsorption capacities.

CHAPTER TWO: LITERATURE REVIEW
2.0 INTRODUCTION
Water pollution due to excess nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen has become
a major environmental concern worldwide. These nutrients, when present in
excessive amounts, can lead to severe water quality degradation, eutrophication,
harmful algal blooms, and oxygen depletion in aquatic ecosystems. Wastewater from
industrial, agricultural, and urban activities is often loaded with these nutrients,
requiring effective treatment methods. Among various strategies, adsorption using
iron oxide nano bio-adsorbents has emerged as a promising solution for the removal
of these nutrients, particularly phosphorus, from wastewater.
2.1. Sources of Nutrient Contaminants in Textile Wastewater and Their Impact
on Water Treatment
Textile wastewater contains various pollutants, including dyes, heavy metals,
surfactants, and organic and inorganic nutrients. The presence of nutrients,
particularly nitrogen and phosphorus compounds, is a significant concern as it can
contribute to water pollution and eutrophication if not properly treated.
One major source of nutrients in textile wastewater is the use of synthetic dyes.
Many dyes, including reactive, azo, and acid dyes which contain nitrogen-based
functional groups. During the dyeing process, a considerable portion of these dyes
remains unbounded to the fabric, and it is subsequently washed off, leading to
increased nitrogen levels in the effluent. Furthermore, some dyes incorporate
phosphorus compounds, further elevating the nutrient content in wastewater.
Similarly, sizing agents and starch-based additives used in the pre-treatment phase
introduce organic polymers such as starch, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), and

carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). When these substances degrade, they release
ammonia, nitrates, and organic nitrogen into the wastewater, contributing to
nutrient pollution.
Detergents and surfactants used in textile processing play a role in introducing
nutrients into wastewater. Most of the commercial detergents contain phosphatebased compound that act as water softeners and cleaning enhancers. Since
phosphates are highly soluble, they persist in wastewater and contribute to
phosphorus pollution. If discharged without adequate treatment, these compounds
promote excessive algal growth in water bodies, hence leading to eutrophication
and oxygen depletion. Furthermore, biochemical reactions occurring within effluent
holding tanks also elevate nutrient levels. As organic matter decomposes under
microbial activity, nitrogenous compounds such as ammonia and nitrates are
released, further increasing the nutrient concentration in wastewater, hence calling
the need for treatment.
The source of water used in textile industries can also influence nutrient levels in
the final effluent. If the water is sourced from rivers, lakes, or groundwater already
containing high concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus, these nutrients become
part of the textile wastewater stream. Pre-treatment methods may not effectively
remove all contaminants, resulting in an accumulation of nutrients in the discharged
effluent. Furthermore, fabric softeners and finishing chemicals used in the final
stages of textile production contain nitrogenous and phosphorus-based compounds,
which dissolve into wastewater during washing and rinsing processes.

2.2. WASTEWATER
Waste water is used water that has been affected by domestic, commercial and
industrial use. Waste water is composed of 99.9% water and the remaining 0.1%
contains organic matter, inorganic compounds and microorganisms (wang, 2021).
Waste water effluents are released to a variety environment, like lakes, ponds,
streams, rivers and estuaries.
2.2.1. COMPOSITION OF WASTE WATER
Wastewater is a complex mixture of various substances originating from households,
industries, and commercial activities. It is primarily composed of water, including
both freshwater and contaminated natural water sources. A significant portion of
wastewater consists of organic matter such as food waste, human and animal waste,
oils, fats, proteins, and plant materials, which serve as energy sources for
microorganisms in treatment processes. Nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus,
derived from detergents, human waste, and agricultural runoff, can lead to water
pollution and eutrophication if untreated. Suspended solids, including sediments,
soil, food particles, paper, and plastics, are also common in wastewater.
Additionally, it may contain hazardous chemicals such as heavy metals, pesticides,
solvents, pharmaceuticals, and industrial toxins, posing environmental and health
risks. Pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and parasites from human and animal
waste, further highlight the need for proper wastewater treatment. The pH and
temperature of wastewater vary depending on its source and can influence the
efficiency of treatment processes, with higher temperatures generally enhancing
microbial activity. Effective treatment is crucial to prevent pollution, protect
ecosystems, and ensure safe water reuse (wang, 2021).

2.2.2. SOURCES AND TYPES OF WASTEWATER
Wastewater which also known as raw sewage originates from households, industries,
commercial or institutional facilities.
2.2.2.1. Domestic wastewater
Domestic wastewater includes all water generated by home dwelling, public
restrooms, public restrooms, schools and other health centers, apartments. They all
produce high volumes of wastewater.

2.2.2.2. Industrial wastewater
Industrial wastewater refers to liquid waste generated from industrial
processes such as manufacturing, food processing, and other production
activities. The composition and level of contamination in industrial
wastewater vary depending on the type of industry and the chemicals
involved in its operations. Industrial wastewater is generally classified based
on
its
physical,
chemical,
and
biological
properties
(Łukasz
Wujcicki,2023).
There are two main categories of industrial wastewater:
1. Inorganic Industrial Wastewater – This type originates from
industries such as steel production, electroplating plants, and coal
processing facilities. It primarily contains inorganic pollutants,
including heavy metals, acids, and other non-biodegradable
substances.
2. Organic Industrial Wastewater – This is generated from industries
that heavily rely on organic compounds for their processes, such as
textile
manufacturing,
tannery
operations,
and
chemical

production. The wastewater from these industries contains organic
pollutants, including dyes, solvents, and biodegradable chemicals
2.2.2.3. Characteristics of constituents of wastewater.
Constituents of Waste Water are characterized in terms of their physical, chemical,
and biological composition.
2.2.2.3.1. Physical characteristics
Turbidity is a measure of water clarity, typically caused by suspended particles such
as organic matter and fine particles like clay. High turbidity in wastewater effluent
can severely affect aquatic ecosystems by reducing light penetration, hindering
aquatic plants from performing photosynthesis, and disrupting the natural balance
of the water body (Walakira & OkotOkumu, 2023). Turbidity is quantified using a
nephelometric method, which involves passing light through the water sample and
measuring the light that is scattered by particles. The unit of measurement for
turbidity is the Nephelometric Turbidity Unit (NTU). According to the National
Environment Management Authority (NEMA), the acceptable discharge standard for
wastewater effluent is 300 NTU.
Total Suspended Solids (TSS)
Total suspended solids (TSS) refer to particles that are not soluble in water and remain
suspended due to their density being less than water. These particles can include
organic and inorganic matter. A common source of TSS is untreated or improperly
treated wastewater effluent. TSS is a critical parameter in wastewater quality

analysis as it impacts aquatic life by reducing oxygen levels and light penetration,
creating poor water conditions.
2.2.2.3.2. Chemical characteristics
PH
pH is the measure of the concentration hydrogen ions, indicating whether water is
acidic (pH < 7), neutral (pH = 7), or alkaline (pH > 7). The pH is an important
parameter as it affects other water treatment processes. Wastewater effluent
having a pH value that is not within the NEMA discharge standards will have a
negative impact on the receiving water bodies when discharged. Effluent with low
pH levels can cause acidity in the receiving water bodies affecting fish in terms of
growth and reproductive activities (Aghalari et al,2023). pH in wastewater affects
the biological reactions and low levels inhibits growth of nitrifying bacteria which
are essential for removing ammonia and nitrates from wastewater.
Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)
Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) is a measure of the amount of dissolved oxygen
required by aerobic microorganisms to decompose organic matter present in
wastewater. High BOD levels indicate a high concentration of organic pollutants,
which can originate from agricultural runoff, industrial effluents, and sewage
(Zayed, 2023). When wastewater with high BOD is discharged into surface water, it
depletes the dissolved oxygen levels, threatening aquatic organisms, particularly
fish, which rely on oxygen for respiration. BOD is measured over five days (BOD5),
and results are expressed in milligrams per liter (mg/L). BOD testing is essential for
evaluating the performance of wastewater treatment systems and determining
effluent quality.

Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)
Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) refers to the amount of oxygen required to
chemically oxidize organic and inorganic compounds in water. It is a crucial
parameter for assessing the organic load in wastewater and its impact on receiving
water bodies (Mensah, 2022). High COD levels in wastewater indicate the presence
of pollutants, and discharging such effluent can drastically reduce dissolved oxygen
levels, further stressing aquatic life.
COD analysis provides a rapid estimate of organic pollution in water samples.
Total Phosphorus
Total phosphorus refers to the sum of all phosphorus forms in wastewater, including
soluble and insoluble forms. Ortho-phosphates are the most easily removed form of
phosphorus during wastewater treatment. Phosphorus typically enters wastewater
from domestic sources such as detergents, human waste, and food residues. High
phosphorus levels in wastewater discharged into water bodies contribute to
eutrophication, promoting excessive algal growth (Wang, 2021). This algal
overgrowth leads to oxygen depletion in the water as algae die and decompose,
resulting in the death of aquatic organisms due to insufficient oxygen levels.
pH
pH is a measure of the hydrogen ion concentration, indicating whether water is
acidic (pH < 7), neutral (pH = 7), or alkaline (pH > 7). The pH of wastewater affects
many chemical and biological processes, including treatment efficiency. Wastewater
effluent that falls outside the NEMA discharge standard range for pH can disrupt the
receiving water bodies. For example, low pH (acidic) wastewater can affect the
reproductive and growth processes of fish and other aquatic life. pH is commonly

measured using a pH meter, making it an essential parameter for water quality
assessment.
2.3. Iron oxide bio-adsorbent
2.3.1. Iron Oxide Bio-Adsorbents for Phosphorus Removal
Iron oxide-based materials are particularly effective in removing phosphorus from
wastewater due to their high affinity for phosphate ions. The silica material
significantly increases their surface area, allowing for greater adsorption capacity.
The interaction between iron oxide and phosphate ions typically occurs via
chemisorption, where phosphate binds to the surface of iron oxide particles, forming
strong Fe–O–P bonds.
Adsorption Mechanism and Equations
The removal of phosphorus using iron oxide nano bio-adsorbents follows a surface
adsorption process that can be described by the chemical reaction below
Fe-OH + H2PO4−→ Fe-O-PO42−+ H2O
This reaction represents the binding of phosphate ions to the surface of iron oxide
(Fe2O3). The adsorptive capacity of iron oxide is influenced by factors such as pH,
initial phosphorus concentration, and the presence of competing ions in the water.
Phosphates typically form inner-sphere complexes with iron hydroxides.
The high affinity of iron oxides for phosphate ions can be attributed to their ability
to form stable complexes through surface hydroxyl groups. Various studies have
demonstrated the efficacy of iron oxide in adsorbing phosphate ions from

wastewater, with significant removal efficiencies across a range of operating
conditions .Fe(OH)3 + PO43− → FePO4 + 3OH−
Iron oxide bio-adsorbents are especially useful in tackling phosphorus pollution due
to their rapid kinetics, high adsorption capacities, and the ability to regenerate and
reuse the adsorbent. Nanoparticles are also more effective in reaching and
interacting with target pollutants in complex water matrices, such as those found
in industrial wastewater.
2.3.2. Factors Affecting Phosphorus Adsorption pH Levels
The adsorption of phosphorus is highly pH-dependent, with maximum removal
typically observed in slightly acidic conditions (pH 4-6). At lower pH, the surface
charge of iron oxides becomes more positive, enhancing the electrostatic attraction
between the adsorbent and phosphate anions Presence of Competing Ions
The presence of other anions, such as sulfates or nitrates, can compete with
phosphate for adsorption sites, potentially reducing the efficiency of phosphorus
removal.
Temperature
Higher temperatures can increase the adsorption rate but may also reduce the
equilibrium capacity by affecting the adsorbent's structure and the interaction
strength between the phosphate ions and iron oxides.
Adsorbent Dosage
The amount of nano bio-adsorbent used also plays a crucial role in determining the
efficiency of phosphorus removal. Higher dosages provide more active sites for

phosphate binding but can lead to aggregation of nanoparticles, reducing surface
area and effectiveness
2.3.2.1. Recent Advances in Phosphorus Removal Technologies
In recent years, there has been considerable progress in developing hybrid and
composite materials for phosphorus adsorption. Iron oxide nanoparticles, when
combined with natural polymers such as chitosan or cellulose, offer enhanced
removal efficiency due to the synergistic effects of the metal oxide and the polymer
matrix. These materials not only provide high adsorption capacities but also exhibit
better stability in wastewater conditions.
Additionally, advances in the synthesis of magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles allow
for easy separation of the adsorbent from the treated water, making the process
more efficient. This magnetic property enables the adsorbent to be recovered and
reused, reducing operational costs in wastewater treatment plants (Łukasz
Wujcicki,2023).
2.3. Wastewater Treatment
