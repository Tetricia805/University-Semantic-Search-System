ABSTRACT
This research report is about the implementation of drip irrigation using drip bottles for
tomato growing. A study to assess the effectiveness of tomato growth and yields was
conducted by drip irrigation using drip bottles for 6 months, ranging from planting to
harvesting.
It describes clearly the activities that were done during this research project, which are
arranged in chapters, and each chapter indicates how the activities were performed.
Tomato production in Kabale District, Uganda, faces challenges due to water scarcity
and inefficient irrigation methods. This study investigated the implementation of drip
irrigation using drip bottles to improve tomato yields.
The project was conducted at the Uganda Christian University, Bishop Barham College
farm, located in Rugarama, Southern Division, Kabale Municipality, Kabale District. Data
was collected through experimental design, field observations, and measurements of
tomato plant growth and yields.
The results showed a significant increase in tomato yields using drip irrigation with drip
bottles compared to traditional irrigation methods. Water usage was also reduced, and
crop water stress was minimized.
Based on the findings, it is recommended that the adoption of drip irrigation using drip
bottles be considered as a sustainable and efficient irrigation method for tomato
production in Kabale District. Farmers can benefit from increased yields, reduced water
usage, and improved crop resilience to drought.
