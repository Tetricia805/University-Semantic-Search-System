ABSTRACT.
Effective communication is a cornerstone of academic success, and university
students' ability to interact with one another is crucial for fostering a collaborative
and productive learning environment. This study investigates the role of X in
enhancing communication among university students, with a specific focus on the
theoretical underpinnings of gratification theory. By employing a mixed-methods
approach, this research explores how X influences students' communication
patterns, satisfaction, and overall academic experience.
Gratification theory, which posits that individuals engage in communication to
fulfill their social and psychological needs, serves as the theoretical framework for
this study. The research design involves a survey of 200 university students,
complemented by in-depth interviews with 20 participants. The findings suggest
that X significantly enhances communication among university students by
increasing their sense of community, reducing feelings of loneliness, and promoting
a sense of belonging.
The results of this study have important implications for university administrators,
educators, and policymakers seeking to create an environment that fosters
effective communication and collaboration among students. The findings highlight
the potential of X as a tool for promoting student engagement, improving
academic outcomes, and enhancing the overall university experience. This
research contributes to the existing body of literature on communication and
technology, providing insights into the role of X in facilitating meaningful
interactions among university students.

CHAPTER ONE
INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY
1.0 Introduction
The topic of the study was the role of x in enhancing communication among
university students: analysis of students at Uganda Christian university. The study
was conducted to explore the use of twitter for communication and engagement
amongst students at Uganda Christian University, main campus at Mukono, to
identify the benefits and challenges and opportunities of using twitter as both a
communication tool and information outlet that supports their studies and to
explore strategies and better the effective use of twitter for communication and
engagements among university students. It contributed knowledge in to field of
digital media research, scholars will use this information to understand insights
into how social media can be harnessed to improve communication among
university students, promoting effective academic collaboration and engagement
while addressing the challenges it introduces. The general objective of the study
was to assess the role of social media in enhancing communication among
university students. This chapter generally presents the background of the study,
problem statement, objectives of the study, justification and significance of the
study, scope of the study, limitations and summary of the study.
1.1 background of the study
Over the years the world has gone digital and it has shaped the way people
communicate or pass information amongst themselves. One of the ways or means


of communication that has shown the digital migration in this century is Twitter
which is now known as X. It was launched in 2006 by some brilliant people such as
Jack Dorsey, Biz Stone and Evans Williams. As time went on it grew in usage and
became a powerful tool for news dissemination, allowing people to follow
different people and accounts, organizations and public figures. Mohammadi E, et
al, Holmes KL (2018)
In this 21st century the uses of the social media include twitter (X) has become
widely adopted by the so many people and especially young generation which
definitely include university student around the world. And they have more
features and introduced a character limit of up to 280 characters which gave a
huge chance of expressing themselves. Stollak, Vandenberg, Burklund, & Weiss,
2011)
Before the rise of social media, the sending and receiving of information, people
could spend days just to receive a piece of news from different places of the
world. And this has shown how people were disconnected with the outside of the
world. For example, way back in the early times/ people in elite societies had two
ways of communication and that was face to face communication or
communication through directly seeing the person, the other form of
communication was Communication at a distance or through temporary or remote
writing, this involved directly seeing the person with whom you communicate but
at a distance. Social media today has become the easiest means of communication
to people far and close by, it is difficult today without social media promotion to
have a sounding business or company. India, 2019.


This transformation in communication over the years serves as a proper
understanding about how social media platforms like Twitter have changed the way
students communicate, share information and engage more with each other and
the world at large. Some of the communication methods before the internet
included radio and television, letter writing, smoke signals, carrier pigeons as early
as the first century BCE, electric telegraph systems around the 1800s, among
others. -Jones P. (2018).
The rise of social media internet-based tools has promoted collaboration and
information sharing (Junco, Helbergert, &Loken,2011), and this has been used in
the education setting, this has in return facilitated better student learning
(kabilan, Ahmad,& Abidin,2010) Students engagement in this study represents
the time and effort that students put in looking out for collaborations and
education activities( Kuh,2001) this outcome in turn comes with advantages such
as academic achievements and positive student learning outcomes for example
critical thinking, individual development among others. (Carini, Kuh, & Klein,
2006; Kuh 1993)
Twitter then introduces the use of Hashtags which was common to use throughout
many nations, which allowed users to participate in a campaign, discover related
content on specific topics. After that the concept of Retweeting came to become
common because this enabled users to share tweets with the people they looked
up to or followed. For example, the (2010 Australian elections) Axel Bruns and
Jean Burgess 2011.
The app then grew to have ‘verified accounts” which were easily identified with
the blue Tick mark that makes it known that this account actually belongs to you.


This added identification helps celebrities, famous organizations to make their
brands more legible and avoids cases of impersonations or admirers. These verifies
accounts are deemed worthy of platform-wide public interest and marked
differently by the app itself. Indranil Paul (2019)
Twitter is also a platform for social awareness, activism, fighting racial
discrimination, among others. For example, the Kaveera campaigns in Uganda
through
the
Hashtags
such
as
#TaasaObutonde,
#Kaveera
Campaign
#BlackLivesMatter, #the Russia- Ukraine war among others. These have brought
about attention and reduction of some deadly social issues. This has therefore
made the twitter we all know and love today a place where people share their
thoughts, engage with one another and stay up to date on breaking news and
trends from people across the globe.
Some of the interesting things about X or twitter have been that the concept of
retweets was formerly introduced by the consumers and because of that it became
incorporated by twitter eventually as an official part or tool on the app. The
hashtag symbol was only used by twitter to put together related information and
tweets together. It is now used by various social media platforms to keep them
hooked on trends and move specific agenda.
The most interesting fact about twitter has been how unnecessary the creators of
the app thought it was, twitter as believes to make a bad first-time impression,
questions like “why the world needs twitter,”” why do we necessarily need to send
to our 50 followers what we had for breakfast” and these statements were
thoughts about the app by the creators of the app. Steven Johnson 2009.
1.3 problem statement.


In the middle of all the ever-changing social media platforms. Social media
facilitates communications and collaboration, it also presents issues related to
distractions, privacy concerns and the potential for superficial interactions (Tess,
2013). Therefore, it is essential to explore how social
1.4 General objective
The general objective of the study was to explore the role of x in enhancing
communication among university students with focus on students at Uganda
Christian university, main campus and seeks to investigate how students make us of
Twitter to improve communication amongst themselves and how it supports
students’ engagement and presence with school work.
1.5 Specific objectives of the study.
1 To explore the use of twitter for communication and engagement amongst
students at Uganda Christian University, main campus at Mukono
2 To identify the benefits and challenges and opportunities of using twitter as
both a communication tool and information outlet that supports their studies.
3 To explore strategies and better the effective use of twitter for communication
and engagements among university students.


1.6 Research questions.
1. How do university students currently use Twitter for communication,
engagement and entertainment?
2. What are the benefits, challenges and opportunities of using Twitter for a
University student?


3. How can students successfully use Twitter to maximize and enhance
communication and engagement in the student community?
1.7 Justification of the study.
There are rapid changes in the communication space in terms of people’s digital
connectivity across distance and time to which the media industry should adjust
to. These have led to readership shift from traditional to digital access of
information, making it easier for audience to receive and consume information in
real life.
The justification of the study will be to understand how twitter can be used as a
communication tool among university students. This will be by exploring the
benefits and challenges of collaborating, content engagement to improve student
engagement among others. This practice can intend help students to be more
aware of how to navigate the app.
1.8 significance of the study.
The significance of the study will have several implications for various stakeholders
including the media industry, further scholars and ministry of education and sports.
The study will focus on the role of x in enhancing communication among university
students contributes to a deeper understanding of social media’s impact on
communication patterns in academic environments.
To the media industry, particularly social media platforms like X can benefit from
understanding how university students utilize this platform for communication and
engagement. By studying the patterns and behaviors of university students at UCU,
media companies can gain insights into the preferences of the younger


demographic, helping them to design more effective engagement strategies for
educational and informational content.
To future scholars, the study will add to the growing body of research on the
intersection between social media and education. Future scholars can use the
findings to further explore the role of x in the academic environment.
To the ministry of education, the findings will provide valuable insights on how x
can be used as a tool for improving communication and engagement with students.
They can develop more interactive responsive communication strategies that
utilizes x to share important academic updates and other essential information.
1.9 scope of the study.
This study scope will solely be fully dependent on university students and
university administration on how they use twitter for spreading and receiving
information. It will focus also on the advantages and disadvantages of using
twitter.
1.10 Geography
This study will be solely based in Uganda Christian University, Mukono, Kampala.
Mukono town is a municipality of in Mukono district in the central region of
Uganda. The district headquarters are in Mukono municipality along jinja road.
This place has a population size of approximately 67,290people and is said to be
one of the largest places in Uganda.
1.11 Time scope.

factors for example, examining relevant and less relevant topics, different hours or
patterns of relevant activities among others.
1.12 Limitation of the study.
The study basically focused on twitter formerly known as x a social media
platform. The limitation came from university students being skeptical about the
study. Other limitation was inadequate funds to facilitate the study. The study set
out to use documents review as a second method of data collection tool. However,
due to ethical consideration.
1.13 summary of the chapter.

and specific research objectives, research questions justification and significance
of the study, scope of the study and limitations that came about the study.













CHAPTER TWO
LITERATURE REVIEW.
2.1 Introduction
This part of the research discusses the uses and gratification theory (UGT) on
which the study was based. It also provides some reviewed literature related to
the topic of the study which is the role of x in enhancing communication among
university students, its benefits, challenges and opportunities.
2.2 Theoretical framework


The uses and gratification theory (UGT) was employed in this study to provide a
foundation for understanding how students at UCU use X to fulfill their
communication needs. The UGT focuses on why individuals actively seek out
specific media to satisfy various needs such as information, personal relationships
and social integration.
The UGT was first coined by Elihu Katz in 1956 as an extension of earlier media
effects theories. Unlike traditional perspectives that viewed audiences as passive
consumers of media content, the UGT positions individuals as active agents who
select media based on their specific needs and desires (Katz, Blumler & Gurevitch,
1974). The theory has its roots in earlier research on media effects conducted in
the 1940s and 1950s particularly studies examining why people consume certain
types of media.
The origin of the UGT is tied to the transitions from behaviorist approaches to
more cognitive and user-centric perspectives on media consumption. Early
research in this field was driven by an interest in understanding the reasons why
individuals chose particular types of media (radio, television) and how used these
media to fulfill their needs for entertainment, social interactions or formation
(McQuail, 1987). Katz along with Jay G, Blumler and Michael Gurevitch developed
the UGT as a way of explaining these processes focusing on the gratifications
people seek from media rather than effects media have on them.
In the context of this research study, UGT is relevant in understanding how UCU
students use X to meet their communication needs. The theory also provides a
framework for analyzing the motivation behind student’s choices of communication
tools and how these tools gratify their needs for academic collaboration, social


interaction and personal engagement. For instance, students might use a platform
like WhatsApp or Facebook groups to satisfy their need for instant communication
and social connectivity. Others might turn to more specialized academic platforms
like Google Classroom or Microsoft Teams to fulfill their need for structured,
productive collaboration on academic projects. This aligns with the core tenets of
UGT where users are seen as goal-directed in their use media actively choosing
platforms that best meet their communication needs (Whiting & Williams, 2013).
Moreover, UGT helps to explain the diversity in communication preferences among
students at UCU. Different students may gravitate towards different tools based on
their specific gratifications whether it be staying informed, maintaining
relationships or managing academic workloads. This understanding is crucial for
analyzing how x enhances communication and how it can be optimized to address
the various needs of students within the university setting.
2.3 Empirical literature review
2.3.1 To explore the use of twitter for communication and engagement amongst
students within Africa and beyond.
The integration of social media platforms like x has gained traction in higher
education as a tool for enhancing communication and engagement. Numerous
studies have explored twitter’s (x) role in academic environments, examining its
effectiveness in fostering student interaction, engagement with content and
communication between peers and instructor. The following literature review
provides empirical evidence from studies conducted in diverse educational
settings, highlighting the specific research contexts.


Kituyi and Namujuzi, (2018) a study conducted at Makerere University. They
investigated how social media platforms including x facilitated academic
communication. Their research highlighted that x was an essential platform for
sharing academic resources, initiating discussion about lecture content and
organizing study groups. According to the findings, Students revealed that the
platform allowed them to communicate more efficiently. The research highlighted
that the limited internet infrastructure in some parts of Uganda posed challenges
to effective x use (Kituyi & Namujuzi, 2018)
A study by Mugera and Ndibalema, (2019) in Tanzania at the university of Dar es
salaam explored the role of x in facilitating peer communication among students.
The findings suggested that x enhanced peer collaboration and knowledge sharing
which was especially beneficial for group assignments and exams preparation. The
study concluded that despites the potential benefits, x usage was still limited by
internet access and cost of data in Tanzanian (Mugera & Ndibalema, 2019).
Adeyemi et ai, (2020) conducted a study at the University of Lagos Nigeria to
assess the social media platforms particularly x on students’ engagement with
course content. The finding indicated that students who used x to follow academic
discussions and hashtags related to their course material were more engaged with
content. X allowed for quick dissemination of information such as news articles
and academic papers which enhanced students understanding of course topic
(Adeyemi et ai, 2020).
Mutebe and Raisamo, 2014 conducted a study at the university of Dar es Salaam in
Tanzania. Their research explored how x increased teacher accessibility and
improved communication with students. The study involved 180 and 20 faculty


members who used x as supplementary tool for communication outside of
traditional classroom settings. The findings indicated that x allowed students to
reach out to their instructors for quick clarifications and follow-up questions after
lectures. Instructors reported that they were able to provide timely feedback and
guidance through the platform which contributed to a more engaged and
interactive learning environment (Mtebe & Raisamo, 2014).
X has been found to be a valuable tool for facilitating communication among
university students particularly in academic settings. Junco, Heibergert and Loken
(2011) investigated the use of x to enhance communication in a classroom setting.
Their study showed that students who used x were more likely to engage in
discussion both inside and outside the classroom, which led to higher levels of
academic engagement. X allows students to communicate quickly with peers and
instructors,
breaking
the
traditional
barriers
associated
with
face-face
communication (Junco et ai, 2011).
Luo and Gao, (2012) conducted research on the use of x as means of peers -topeers communication among undergraduate students enrolled in the media studies
course in university in the United States. Their findings suggested that x facilitates
informal communication, where students can easily share information, ideas and
resources with one another. This peer engagement fosters a sense of community
among students which is critical for academic and social development within
university student’s settings. The researchers concluded that x promoted a
collaborative and informal learning environment where students felt comfortable
communicating and exchanging ideas outside of structured classroom settings (Lou
& Gao, 2012).


X has also been showed to enhance students’ engagement with course content. A
study by Kassens Noor (2012), conducted at Michigan state University, examined
how integrating x into university course can promote active learning and students’
engagement. The researcher revealed that students who participated in x
discussions related to course material demonstrated higher engagement levels
compared to those who did not use x. this engagement was not limited to the
classroom but extended to real-time interactions during lectures and after class
hours (Kassens Noor, 2012)
Tiernan, (2014) carried out research at Dublin Institute of Technology in Ireland on
enhancing engagement through X involving students enrolled in marketing course.
The study examined how integration of x in the course promoted students’
collaboration and engagement. The finding reveals that students ere more likely to
participate in collaborative learning activities such as group projects and
discussions, when x served as a communication tool. The researcher concluded
that x serves as a platform where students could exchange ideas, discuss course
topic and provide feedback to one another in real-time thus fostering a more
collaborative learning environment (Tiernan, 2014)
2.3.2 To identify the benefits and challenges and opportunities of using twitter
as both a communication tool and information outlet that supports their
studies.
2.3.2.1 Benefits of x on learning community
the research study is mostly centered around the benefits, challenges and
opportunities of x to the elite and university students. X is an online social network
that’s accessible to anyone with an internet cable device used to share all types of


information, political educational, current research among others. The increased
involvement of twitter in higher education will make this social media app robe
more useful and become more personalized in teaching and being learned from
using current research in medical education. Sarah Judith Forgie, (2013)
According Veletsianos (2012) found out that Twitter is used by university students
to `receive and share immediate and frequent course work information, to ask and
give feedback to their instructors and share information outside context. It’s a
form of receiving knowledge from instructors, fellow students and communicate
and connect with professionals in the area of study.
Lin (2013), indicated that x in universities has been incorporated as a tool of data
collection for both students and elite through social media networking. This is
through providing space for tweeps to have profiles and make hyperlinks with users
with similar interest or content. This experience makes it easy for students to
share in on their resources with one another. Gikas and Grant, (2013)
Social media platforms are sites where people create public or semi- public
profiles for public interaction and sharing of content. These activities provide
internet users with a chance to express themselves on their handles and update
their status. This also helps young people to boost their self-esteem and be of
influence in other people’s lives. (Asmara Irfan, 2018)
Though Social media platforms are more popular in the entertainment and in
popular business, there are many benefits of using these platforms have helped
people especially the young people in education. Young people use social media
sites more than old people as proved by most studies, this is because the young


people will use the internet for many things for example passing time, academic
purposes among others. (Asmara Irfan,2018)
Social media networking has increased university ranking in higher education, this
is through the increasing student responses on their social media platform which as
has made marketing of online education and sharing of data possible thus helping
students to better their decision making. Social media will be effective when
students can get all the information, they need in a click rather than having to go
back to the traditional methods of gathering information. (Asmara Irfan, 2018)
Studying using social media provided a direct look of how university life is like and
makes sure that students are guided every step of the way. Studying online also
known as e-learning this shows diversity and this helps to maintain brand image for
the institution or the university thus increasing on the ranking and positive use of
social media. (Asmara Irfan, 2018)
2.3.2.2 Challenges of x on students
Social media has influenced the lives of people differently in not all good ways,
the number of young people that join social media on a daily basis have increases
by 400million as of 2021. (Kemp,2021). Additionally, the number of social media
users increases by more than 1 million every day. People lately are so dependent
on social media that the young people these days including university students,
who prefer using social media to communicate, using eLearning or online learning
to communicate rather than engaging in physical classes with their peers.
(Kemp,2021)
Attention of students tends to be swayed away from their education by the
internet through social media platforms such as twitter, Ahmed (2019).


Additionally, students of not well supervised will use social media for nonacademic purposes and this surely be unfriendly to the outcome of their academic
performance because of the misuse of this freedom. Agholor et al. (2020)
2.3 To explore strategies to better the effective use of twitter for
communication and engagements among university students.

X has become an essential tool for communication and engagement among
university students. As higher education continues to evolve in a digitally driven
society, the need to explore effective communication and engagement strategies
among university students has become increasingly relevant.
Tess, (2013) argument that social media can extend the learning environment
allowing students to collaborate and discuss academic content in a more informal
setting. By leveraging x for academic purposes, students can enrich their learning
experience, fulfilling both cognitive and social integrative needs outlined by Katz
and Blumler (2013).
research by Greenhow and Lewin (2016), found that students who strategically use
social media for educational purpose experience greater academic and social
benefits. UGT explains that students can enhance their gratification by tailoring
their media use to meet their specific goals. By curating a focused x feed, students
can fulfill their cognitive needs more efficiently. Ensuring that they are exposed to
relevant and useful content.

















CHARPTER THREE.
METHODOLOGY.
3.0 Introduction.
This part outlines the research design, sampling, data collection method, study
location, population and population size and research tools. It also presents
process for analyzing and interpreting the data
3.2 The research design


According to Creswell & Plano, 2007), research design is a procedure for
collecting, analyzing interpreting and reporting data in research studies. Leedy &
Ormrod (2013), stated that case study research refers to a qualitative approach in
which the investigator explores bounded system or multiple a bounded systems of
cases over time through detailed, in-depth data collection involving multiple
sources of information.
3.3 Research approach
This study employed qualitative research methodology. For the qualitative
component of study, sampling questions were used to most importantly the people
of most influence in the university, the quantitative approach, a random sampling
is used to make sure that different views that are even from students of other
universities are considered.
3.4 Study site
This study is to be based in Mukono which is located within the east of the central
business district of Kampala. The study was conducted in one tertiary institution
and that is Uganda Christian University.
3.5 Population.
According to Shukla 2020, population refers to a set or group od=f all the units on
which the findings of the research are to be applied. The population of this study
was Uganda Christian university. This population was selected as a fair
representation of the populations where the study findings was generalized to
apply all the university students in UCU. University students vary from different
courses and years.


3.6 Target population
The study population including the university students from different courses and
years and the university administration (lecturers). These categories of
interviewees were targeted because they are consumers of information from
twitter (x). 30 interviews were involved in the study 20 students (10 from school of
journalism and 10 from school of law) and 10 lectures from the two department
respectively
3.7 Sample size.
The study sample size included the 20 students and 10 lecturers, adding up to 30
respondents.
According to Taherdoost, sample size is defined as a significant feature of any
empirical study in which the goal is to make interferences about a population. In
order to generalize from a random sample and avoid sampling errors or biases, a
random sample is needed to be of adequate size. The participants were selected
based on their experiences of using x to enhance communication
3.8 Sampling procedure.
The study employed a purposive sampling procedure to select the respondents,
selecting them based on the knowledge and experiences on using x. Tongco 2007,
says that purposive sampling refers to a type of non-probability sampling that is
most effective when one needs to study a certain cultural domain with knowledge
and experience.
3.9 Research method of data collection.


In-depth interview guide was used in this study to collect data on the role of x on
enhancing communication among university students but with focus on UCU. this
method was selected due to the nature of qualitative method of data collection.
that am using here is the mixed method.
3.10 Data analysis
In this study the use of mixed methods was employed to analyze and gather data.
Qualitative research was used through interviews, focus group meetings and
properly analyzed with the thematic analysis. Furthermore, Quantitative research
was carried out to understand my research topic for example through surveys,
questionnaires among others.
3.11 Ethical considerations
The research considerations will be that ill obtain consent from people before
using any information that’s not initially accessible to me. This will help people to
trust be more and be confidential and trust in my studies. This can be achieved
through making accessible my final results to people to see what I’ve collected or
put together.
I will make sure to emphasize anonymity of participants data, though making sure
they are fully aware and have given their consent and most importantly to make it
evident that I put first protecting their identities though out the process of
carrying out my research.
3.12 Research limitation.
Limitations for example inaccessibility of a specific population in the university.
This will be solved by making sure that my research involvement should entail


famous or influential students in the university i.e. the students in the guild
government, the guild president, among ithers. This is because the people have
access to a specific number of students.
Time frame. The time to collect data from students is limited hence affecting the
sample size and how far my analysis can go. I will employ proper planning and
collecting data efficiently through surveys, social media mining, interviews or
focus groups conducted online this will intern reach a larger number of people,
analyze trends, allow efficient data analysis among others.

ability to extend classroom discussions into the digital space. One of the
respondents stated,


“.......... I use x to curate a list of academic and professional resources that
helps me in my students and x can be an extension of the classroom where
discussions can be continued beyond lectures.”










CHAPTER FIVE
DISCUSSIONS OF THE KEY FINDINGS
5.0 introduction
This chapter discusses the key findings presented in chapter four and draws
connections to the literature review and the theoretical framework, especially the
uses and gratifications theory. The discussion will be organized around the three
research questions, exploring how the findings relate to previous studies and
theoretical concepts.


5.1 discussions of the key findings
The findings from chapter four show that university students utilize x for various
forms of communication including academic discourse, professional networking and
real-time updates on events. This aligns with previous literature review that
suggests x is an effective platform for facilitating immediate and concise
communication in educational setting (Junco, Elavsky & Heiberger, 2013).
The uses and gratification theory provides a lens to understand this behavior, as
students actively choose x to satisfy specific needs. The theory posits that
individuals use media to fulfill particular desires such as the need for social
interaction, information seeking and personal identify development (Katz, Blumler
& Gurevitch, 1973). In the context of communication, students are gratified by x’s
ability to provide fast and direct communication with peers, lecturers and industry
professional.

5.2 to identify the benefits, challenges and opportunities of using x of using x
as both communication tool and information outlets that supports their studies
5.2.1 benefits
The benefits of using x identified in chapter four such as networking opportunities,
real-time information access and enhanced academic engagement are well
supported in the literature reviews presented in chapter two. Junco et ai, (2011)
found that x improves students’ engagement and fosters professional connections
particularly in the fields such as journalism were staying current with industry
trends is essential.


Through the lens of UGT, these benefits can be understood as the gratification of
students cognitive, affective and social integrative needs. For example, journalism
students use x to stay updated on industry news, fulfilling their cognitive needs for
information. Meanwhile the ability to network with professional satisfies social
integrative needs, helping students build social capital (Ellison, Steinfeld & Lampe,
2007).
5.2.2 Challenges of using x as both communication tool and information outlets
that supports their studies
However, students also face challenges when using x including information
overload, time management issues and the spread of misinformation. These
challenges align with the previous studies that highlighted the potential negative
effects of social media use (Lee & Suh, 2016). For example, students struggling to
manage their time and filter relevant content from the vast amount of information
on x echoes similar findings by Ahmed and Qazi (2011), who pointed out the risks
of social media distractions in educational contexts.
UGT explains that while x may fulfill the need for information and connection, it
also introduces problems such as cognitive overload where students become
overwhelmed by abundance of content. This is consistent with Katz el ai, (1973)
argument that while media use can gratify certain needs, it can also produce
unintended consequences such as stress and disengagement.
The prevalence of misinformation and echo chambers on x further complicates its
uses as an academic tool. This issue, identified by both students and lecturers
supports the previous research that highlights the dangers of unverified
information on social media (Bessi et ai, 2015).


5.3 To explore strategies to better the effective use of x for communication and
engagement among university students.
The findings suggest that students can maximize their use of x by curating their
content, engaging in hashtag campaigns and using the platform for collaborative
academic projects. This aligns with research by Greenhow and Lewin (2016), who
found that students who strategically use social media for educational purpose
experience greater academic and social benefits. UGT explains that students can
enhance their gratification by tailoring their media use to meet their specific
goals. By curating a focused x feed, students can fulfill their cognitive needs more
efficiently. Ensuring that they are exposed to relevant and useful content.
The lecturers also emphasized the potential of x as a tool for academic
collaboration and engagement beyond the classroom. This is consistent with Tess,
(2013) argument that social media can extend the learning environment allowing
students to collaborate and discuss academic content in a more informal setting.
By leveraging x for academic purposes, students can enrich their learning
experience, fulfilling both cognitive and social integrative needs outlined by Katz
and Blumler (2013)
5.4 conclusion
The discussion reveals that university students use x for variety of purposes
including communication, engagement and entertainment all of which are deeply
intertwined with the principles of the uses and gratifications theory. While x offers
numerous benefits such as enhanced academic engagement and professional
networking opportunities, it also presents challenges related to information
overload and the spread of misinformation.


By curating content, participating in meaningful discussions and leveraging x for
academic collaboration, students can maximize the platforms potential for
communication and engagement within the student community. Ultimately, x plays
a significant role in fulfilling cognitive, social and personal needs of university
students, reinforcing its importance as both an academic and social tool.








CHAPTER SIX
RECOMMENDATION AND AREAS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH
6.0 introduction
This chapter presents practical recommendations for students and educators to
optimize their use on x in university students’ settings. Additionally, it identifies
potential areas for future research to expand
6.1 Recommendation for students


The study presents that students should actively curate their twitter feeds to
include relevant academic and industry information. This can help reduce
information overload and ensure that students stay updated on key trends and
developments in their fields of study.
Furthermore, the research recommends that students should use clear objectives
for x use to maximize destructions and time management issues through defining
specific objectives for their use of x, whether it be for academic engagement,
networking or entertainment. Setting goals can help students stay focused on using
the platform productively.
6.2 Recommendation for Educators
The research recommends that educators should encourage the academic use of x
by integrating it into their coursework, such as using it for class discussions, or
organizing debates on relevant topics. This can help foster student engagement
and extend learning beyond the classroom.
In addition, educators should incorporate lessons on media literacy and digital
citizenship into their curricula. This will help students navigate social media
responsibly and critically assess information and use platforms like twitter, for
constructive academic purposes.
6.4 Areas for further studies
This study has provided valuable insights into how university students should use
twitter, there are several areas of future research that could further enhance
understanding social media s role in education.


Longitudinal studies on social media use. Future research could conduct
longitudinal studies to track how students use of twitter evolves over time and how
it impacts their academic performance, professional development and social wellbeing throughout their university careers.
Exploring the impact of twitter on mental health. Given the findings related
challenges like information overload and distraction, further research could
explore the impact of twitter use on students’ s mental health. This could include
examining the relationship between social media use, academic pressure and
mental wellbeing.
Comparative studies across disciplines. Future studies could compare the use of
twitter across different academic disciplines to determine if their significant
variations in how students in different fields utilize the platform for
communication, engagement and learning.
