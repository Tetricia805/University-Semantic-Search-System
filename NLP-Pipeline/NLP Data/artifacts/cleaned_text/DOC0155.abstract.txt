The growing demand for affordable and sustainable building materials in Uganda,
coupled with increasing environmental concerns, has prompted the need to explore
alternative methods of clay brick stabilization. Conventional clay bricks are
typically fired using firewood, a practice that contributes heavily to deforestation,
carbon emissions, and other forms of environmental degradation. This research
investigates the feasibility of using a hybrid stabilization method involving a bioenzyme (Terrazyme) and pineapple leaf fiber (PALF) to improve the engineering
properties of clay bricks while minimizing ecological impact.

The study was conducted using high plasticity clay obtained from Siron Village,
Kirwoko Parish in Kaptanya Subcounty, Kapchorwa District. The clay soil underwent
a series of laboratory tests, including particle size distribution, Atterberg limits,
compaction, compressive strength, shrinkage, and water absorption tests in
accordance with British Standards. PALF was extracted from agricultural waste,
characterized through tensile strength analysis, and evaluated for reinforcement
suitability. Terrazyme was produced through a controlled fermentation process and
tested for pH, viscosity, and concentration.
Experimental brick samples were prepared using varying proportions of PALF (2%–
6%) and Terrazyme (0%–5%) by weight and volume respectively. Among all the
combinations, the optimal mix—2% PALF and 100 ml/m3 of Terrazyme—produced
unfired bricks with the best performance. These bricks achieved a compressive
strength of 2.7 MPa, which is significantly higher than that of untreated bricks, and

showed a 15% reduction in water absorption and 30% reduction in linear shrinkage.
The hybrid stabilization not only enhanced strength and dimensional stability but
also improved durability by reducing moisture susceptibility and potential for
cracking.
The results of this research confirm that hybrid stabilization using bio-enzymes and
natural fibers can produce structurally sound, cost-effective, and environmentally
sustainable clay bricks without the need for high-temperature firing. This technique
holds great potential for application in rural housing, eco-construction, and
lowincome settlements across Uganda. Moreover, the use of locally available
materials such as pineapple leaves promotes circular economy practices and
reduces agricultural waste. The study concludes by recommending further field
trials, scaleup studies, and long-term performance evaluations under various
climatic conditions to establish the method as a mainstream construction practice.

CHAPTER I: INTRODUCTION
1.1
Background and Introduction
Like most developing countries, Uganda has a large housing deficit contributed by
its rapid growth in population and urbanization. Clay bricks remain among the most
widely applied building materials within both rural and urban areas, mostly because
of their comparatively lower costs and higher accessibility. Most of this production
is at a small scale and in places like Siron, where high plasticity clay is locally
available. Such clay must be stabilized to enhance its strength and durability.
These are typically fired with firewood, which is very energy-intensive and
destructive to the environment. Relating to this, it contributes to deforestation,
which means loss of biodiversity, soil erosion, and also causes a high rate of carbon
dioxide emission. According to a report by Bodipo-Memba et al., 2022, it is stated
that Uganda loses its forests annually by 1.8%, proportionately with a higher part
of this deforestation mainly belongs to the collection of fuelwood for brick kilns. If
that wasn't enough, high-plasticity clays rich in montmorillonite, such as in Mukono
for example, bring additional troubles: these soils swell with increase in water
content and shrink with decrease, thus they do not present structural stability
unless better stabilized. As said, increased firing resolves this, but the
environmental and financial costs of brick kilns are very high. Application of
firewood-saving alternative stabilization methods thus stands as a pressing need.
The application of bio-enzyme technology, alongside the utilization of agricultural
byproducts such as pineapple leaf fiber, is gaining recognition as a sustainable

method to improve the resilience and structural integrity of clay bricks,
concurrently reducing environmental repercussions (Saini & Vaishnava, 2015).
Although it populates the places with intensive pineapple culture, pineapple leaf
fiber is regarded as a waste product. While it has very good tensile strength and
binding properties, using it as reinforcement material in the construction industries
is worth the result it has shown in tests. Razman et al., 2024 The current work
represents an ecologically friendly method of using a bio-enzyme coupled with
stabilisation, which is the use of PALF for solving problems with plasticity in clay
soil, reduction in various environmental crises connected with traditional
production methods of bricks.

1.2
Problem Statement
The Ugandan manufacturing of clay bricks is so dependent on firewood; this
enhances deforestation and environmental degradation. According to the
Ministry of Water and Environment of Uganda as cited by Bodipo-Memba et al. 2022,
it is estimated that about 70% of energy that is used in brick kilns is firewood,
costing about 92,000 hectares of forest loss annually.
Besides just accelerating this process of deforestation, it also emits a lot of carbon
dioxide into the atmosphere, hence contributing to the climate crisis. With
increased expansion in the brick-making industry, Uganda is getting increasingly
unsustainable and inching closer to an ecological disaster. In addition, conventional
clay bricks, specifically made from smectite clays found in eastern Uganda,
precisely in Budadiri, Chelel, Mutufu, and Siron areas, have insufficient mechanical
strength. Smectite clays, having high acidities with values between 0.1 and 1.85
mol/g, with compositions of 40-50% smectite, 2030% being the feldspars
component, and other element makeups like iron, aluminum, and silicon being 11%,
18%, and 60%, respectively, perform moderately, with high absorption of water to
yield bricks that are weak and brittle (Wasajja-Navoyojo et al., 2016; Mukasa-
Tebandeke et al., 2015).
The mean compressive strength for these conventional bricks range between 0.36
and 1.2 MPa, a measure below the standards in global construction standards
according to MukasaTebandeke et al. 2014.

Lime and cement have conventionally been used as additives to improve brick
standards; however, their production is highly energy-intensive and one of the
major contributors to green house gases. For instance, cement industries alone
contribute about 8% to global carbon emissions (Andrew, 2019). There thus is an
urgent need for environmentally friendly products that will help in stabilizing clay
bricks without reliance on high-energy materials like cement and lime.
The bio-enzymatic treatments may increase the cohesion in soils, decrease the
permeability, and enhance compressive strength of clays by ion exchange reaction
mechanisms which favored the development of stable aggregates. According to
Saini & Vaishnava, 2015, bioenzyme-treated bricks demonstrated better
compressive strength of as high as 4 MPa compared with conventional bricks.
Addition of PALF, a full natural resource in Uganda, improves significantly the
mechanical properties of the clay bricks. Presence of PALF improves the tensile
strength and durability in the composites hence an ideal material for reinforcement
in bricks. This paper tries to integrate the use of bio-enzymes and PALF in the
production of bricks with the aim of attaining environmental sustainable
stabilization methods that reduce reliance on kiln firing, environmental
degradation and enhances the mechanical efficiency of the fired clay bricks.
Bricks with increased compressive strength and improved on water absorption, and
with an increased life compared to the traditional method, are expected.
This work, therefore, investigates the application of bio-enzyme and pineapple leaf
fibers as additives for stabilization in clay bricks.
