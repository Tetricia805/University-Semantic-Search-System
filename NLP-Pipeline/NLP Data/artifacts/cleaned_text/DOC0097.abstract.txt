The issue of access to clean drinking water continues to be a great struggle in various
rural locations where the sources of groundwater are becoming more and more polluted
with heavy metals and other inorganic substances. At the same time, heavy metals such
as lead (Pb2+) and copper (Cu2+) are classified as hazards of the highest order due to their
toxic nature, persistence, and bioaccumulation (Tchobanoglous et al., 2014). A study on
water quality in Kyabalogo Village, Nakisunga Sub-county, Mukono District, Uganda,
indicated the existence of Pb and Cu in the spring water exceeding the tolerable limits
for drinking water. Therefore, the water cannot be used in households without prior
purification.
The current work is focused on the application of natural zeolite as an inexpensive and
effective adsorbent to purify the spring groundwater by removing Pb2+ and Cu2+ at the
household level. Previous literature shows that divalent heavy metals can be taken away
by zeolites by 80–95% via ion-exchange processes, where the ions of the heavy metals
Pb2+ and Cu2+ in the solution replace the cations (e.g., Na+, K+, Ca2+) that are in the
zeolite lattice (Misaelides, 2011). The results of this research work are expected to
provide a cheap and an eco-friendly approach solution for the rural water treatment
community. (Wang & Peng, 2010).

CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION
This chapter includes the background, problem statement and geographical scope and
justification of this research project.
1.1 BACKGROUND
Pollution from both point and non-point sources still continue to pollute essential water
resources on a global scale. Major contributors to the pollution of both surface water
and groundwater are industrial discharges, domestic sewage, agricultural runoff, and
changes in the environment (WHO, 2024). In many parts of the world that are still
developing, groundwater that people rely on for drinking purposes is slowly discovered
to contain harmful inorganic pollutants and especially heavy metals such as lead (Pb),
copper (Cu), iron (Fe), and cadmium (Cd). These metals are unyielding, nondegradable, and their presence even in minuscule amounts causes a very serious health
risk (Tchobanoglous et al., 2014).

By the year 2035, the global population increase is estimated to be around 7.9 billion,
and consequently, the water crisis is to be more severe than it is now, particularly in
rural areas where the supply of water treatment facilities is limited (WHO, 2024). The
conventional use of filtration by households such as plain sand filtration, membrane
filters, and biochar filters has been found to be inadequate as poor adsorption capacity
and large variation in maintaining the level of metals below that of the drinking water
standard have been cited as the causes.

Among the various treatment methods available, the one based on adsorption has
gained recognition as the most efficient and at the same time the least expensive
solution to heavy metals removal. Natural zeolites in particular are the most popular
ones, boasting the property of having the highest cation-exchange capacity, micropore
structure, and strong affinity for the divalent metal ion such as Pb2+ and Cu2+ (Wang &
Peng, 2010). In this manner, zeolites can swap their cations (Na+, Ca2+, K+) for those of
toxic metals, significantly reducing the concentration of metals in contaminated water
within minutes (Misaelides, 2011).
This research focuses on the purification of Kyabalogo Village, Nakisunga Sub- by using
modified zeolites as an adsorbent for household drinking water.

1.2 PROBLEM STATEMENT
The major sources of water in Uganda are underground, and in addition to that, natural
springs are also used for domestic purposes, drinking water, and small-scale economic
activities. In Kyabalogo village, Nakisunga sub-county, the spring water is the main
source of water since it is free, easy to access, and available all year round. However,
human activities such as improper waste disposal, agricultural runoff, and unregulated
land use around these water sources have deteriorated the quality of the water
significantly (WHO, 2024).

Water quality monitoring from community springs in central Uganda indicates the
presence of heavy metals and pathogenic microorganisms in large quantities (Nzanzu et
al., 2022) The heavy metals Pb, Cu, and Cd are listed among the ones that are very

toxic and detrimental to the health of living organisms at very low concentrations
(Tchounwou et al., 2012). Furthermore, with the presence of pathogens in the water,
the risk to public health is even greater, with fecal coliforms being detected in the range
of 1000 CFU/100 mL (Nzanzu et al., 2022).

A good number of the Kyabalogo Village residents are elderly or low-income and thus
cannot afford the piped water from the National Water and Sewerage Corporation
(NWSC). They, therefore, rely on spring water that is likely to be contaminated by human
activities and groundwater infiltration of heavy metals. Hence, the need for developing
inexpensive household-scale treatment systems is very critical.

Popular household filtration systems like sand filters, membrane filters, and cloth
filtration have not shown high efficiency in the removal of dissolved heavy metals. On
the other hand, natural zeolites are known for their high cation-exchange capacity and
great attraction to divalent heavy metals like Pb2+ and Cu2+, which makes the
