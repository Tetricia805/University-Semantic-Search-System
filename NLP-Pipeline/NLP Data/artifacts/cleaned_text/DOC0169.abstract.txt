This research presents the design and implementation of an Online Health Donation System to
Fight Against Fistula at Budadiri Health Center IV in Sironko District, Eastern Uganda. The
system aims to improve resource management, enhance donor engagement, and promote
transparency in the treatment of fistula patients. The study used interviews, questionnaires, and
system analysis to gather data. The developed system was tested and validated to ensure userfriendliness, security, and efficiency. Results showed that digitalizing the donation process can
significantly improve healthcare delivery and donor trust. The project contributes to the
development of sustainable digital health solutions in rural Uganda.

JUSTIFICATION OF THE STUDY
This study is justified because many rural health centers in Uganda still rely on manual systems
for managing donations, leading to inefficiency, data loss, and lack of transparency. Developing
an online health donation system will not only help Budadiri Health Center IV manage donations
better but can also serve as a model for other health institutions in the country. The system
provides an efficient, secure, and transparent way to manage donations, improving
accountability and resource utilization.

LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY
This study was limited by time and financial constraints, which restricted data collection to one
health center. In addition, internet instability and lack of advanced computer equipment in rural
areas may affect full system implementation. However, these limitations do not affect the
reliability or relevance of the study’s findings. The project still provides valuable insights and can
be scaled up with further support and resources.
