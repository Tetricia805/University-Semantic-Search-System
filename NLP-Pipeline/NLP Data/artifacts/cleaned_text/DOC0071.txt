ABSTRACT
Asphalt pavements are required to have long-term performance and durability to keep highway
traffic safe and protected from damage from serious failures such as rutting which is described
as the permanent deformation of the pavement surface in the area of the wheel path (Huang,
2012).This was the primary reason this research was conducted based on the idea that OMMT
could potentially be used to increase the mechanical and volumetric properties and, therefore,
the rutting resistance of the asphalt mixture. Unlike previous studies that concentrated on using
montmorillonite in its untreated form, this research investigated the use of surface-modified
OMMT to improve OMMT compatibility with the bituminous binder. Results from the laboratory
indicated that adding 1% OMMT by weight of aggregate achieved significant improvements in the
asphalt mixture's Marshall Stability (17.2 kN) and Flow Value (3.6 mm) as well as the Air Voids
Content (4.2%), Voids in Mineral Aggregate Value (15.3%), Voids Filled with Bitumen Value
(72.4%), and Bulk Density Value (3.352).
A comprehensive literature review identified the mechanisms that cause rutting in pavements
and evaluated the structural response of pavements to loading, and indicated that the physical
and performance-related characteristics of the asphalt mixtures tested were adequate to meet
asphalt pavement performance requirements and supported an increase in their deformation
resistance. Additionally, the standard mechanical tests indicated that adding OMMT to the
asphalt mixture hindered rutting and created a more uniform distribution of applied loads.
These results suggest that the use of Binders that use Nanotechnology such as OMMT is a more
efficient method to increase the load-carrying ability of Ugandan Highways, allowing them to
last longer and reduce maintenance expenses.

CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
Road infrastructure is vital to national economic growth as well as to the social
development of any country including Uganda. Through its ability to enable trade
and mobility and access to essential services through its road network system,
Uganda is able to grow its economy. In Uganda, the road network consists mostly
of flexible pavements made of conventional bitumen (UNRA, 2023), and serves as
the backbone of the country's transport sector. Unfortunately, premature failure of
flexible pavements from the effects of environmental conditions such as cracking,
rutting and potholes continues to be a problem causing increased costs for
maintenance, safety concerns, and decreased economic activity (Mugo et al.,
2021).
The mechanical properties of asphalt concrete constitute a significant portion of
the performance of flexible pavements. Heavy traffic on flexible pavements exerts
repeated axial loadings and therefore flexible pavements must be able to
withstand the effects of these loads. The bitumen component of a flexible
pavement must retain enough strength and elasticity to resist both permanent
deformation and crack fatigue. However, most standard bitumen and its related
composites typically do not have adequate mechanical strength to withstand the
stresses associated with heavy vehicle loads,which leads to pavement detoriation.
Additionally, bitumen is susceptible to thermal and water damage, which further
reduces the load response capability of the pavement and enables more frequent
repair and maintenance of flexible pavements (Apeagyei et al., 2018; Kisaaka et
al., 2022).
Recent advancements in nano technology of clay have shown montmorillonite
(MMT) is a viable addition (or modifier) to asphalt. The 2:1 silicate structure of
MMT combined with its vast surface area allows MMT to be dispersed within the
binder (asphalts) and to interact with the binder at a much greater rate than
previously available MMT to create a matrix of intercalated nanoparticulates.
Intercalated nanoparticulates prevent freedom of movement of the asphalt-bound
molcules; therefore, increasing the stiffness and shear strength of the asphaltbound products and improving thermodynamic (or thermal) stability compared to
non-treated MMT forms of montomorillonite.


Historically,
researchers
have
studied
montmorillonite
using
untreated
montmorillonite products – typically exhibiting limited compatibility with
hydrophobic materials such as asphalt. Furthermore, this investigation involved
using organo-philic montmorillonite having the organo-philic grade of MMT treated
with organic cation surface modifiers to create organo-philic montmorillonite
products with improved dispersion qualities when incorporated into a hydrophobic
binder such as asphalt and providing an improved binder performance when
subject to changes in load and thermocycle stresses during use under heavy loads.
This research evaluated the additive of OMMT Nano clay, on flexible pavement and
increased the structural integrity, stiffness and shear strength of the asphalt
products. As a result of incorporating OMMT Nano clay, asphalt products have
enhanced resistance to deterioration from repetitive loading or repeated axial
stresses imposed by the weight of heavy commercial vehicle traffic.
















1.1PROBLEM STATEMENT
The deteriorating of asphalt pavements in Uganda at a rapid rate is because the
asphalt cannot support the heavy axle loadings being put on it causing rutting,
fatigue cracking and the destruction of the asphalt due to moisture ingress. The
creation of ruts is of particular concern because not only does it reduce the
longevity of the pavement’s service use, but also creates a hazardous situation for
vehicles operating on the pavement with the potential to create an accident. The
concentrated stress created by axle loadings directly affects the asphalt pavement
the weight of the axle acts as a point source of stress on the pavement leading to
continual deformations occurring throughout the different layers of the asphalt
pavement. With repeated axle loadings, there will be an accumulation of the
deformations resulting in an increase of plastic strains developing within the
asphalt pavement weakening the overall structural integrity of the asphalt
pavement. The result of this is the creation of ruts throughout the wheel path of
the asphalt pavement severely reducing the evenness of the pavement surface and
increasing the hazard to vehicles operating on said pavement (Zhao, Z et al.,
2020). With heavier axle load requirements for heavier trucks on the market today,
rutting has become the number one reason for asphalt pavement failure. This has
led to the need for the development of new and innovative procedures for
managing and maintaining asphalt pavements.
Routine maintenance strategies used along the Mukono-Mbalala section of the
Kampala-Jinja Highway have failed to decrease the amount of rutting that
continues to occur within the pavement. This section of roadway carries very high
volumes of heavy commercial vehicles causing the pavement to be subjected to
extremely high axle loadings and causing the development of permanent
deformations at the wheel path within the pavement. Due to the amount of
overloaded vehicles operating on the Mukono-Mbalala section of the Kampala-Jinja
Highway, the rate of accumulation of plastic strains in the asphalt layers has
significantly increased; thus causing the rate of rut formation to increase.
(Kaloush, Rada, and Youcef, 2001)
This study aims to evaluate the rutting resistance of asphalt concrete modified
with organophilic Montmorillonite Nanoclay, with a focus on its performance under


heavy axle loading. By investigating the effects of nanoclay modification on the
rheological properties and rutting resistance of asphalt mixtures.
1.2MAIN OBJECTIVE
To evaluate the rutting resistance of asphalt concrete modified with organophilic
montmorillonite Nano clay
1.2.1SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES
1. To characterize the properties of oganophilic Montimorillonite Nano clay,
bitumen and aggregates.
2. To determine the optimum OMMT Nano clay content to be used in the mix
3. To determine the mechanical properties and rutting resistance of organophlic
Montmorillonite nanoclay-modified bitumen
1.2.2RESERCH QUESTIONS
1. What are the properties of organophlic Montimorillonite Nano clay, bitumen
and aggregates.
2. What is the optimum OMMT Nano clay content to be used in the mix
3. What are the mechanical properties and rutting resistance of organophilic
Montmorillonite nanoclay-modified bitumen













1.3SCIENTIFIC JUSTIFICATION
Repeated axle loading causes a permanent deformation of asphalt pavements,
resulting in a shorter operational life of the pavement (AASHTO 2017). The usage
organo-montmorillonite (OMMT) nanoclay to improve the mechanical properties of
asphalt mixtures will increase their resistance to rutting (You et al. 2011).
Montmorillonite is a type of clay mineral that has a plate-like structure composed
of silicate polymers and when dispersed within the bitumen forms either an
intercalated or exfoliated nanostructure (Jahromi & Khodaii 2009). The
nanostructure that is formed restricts the movement of molecules thus increasing
the stiffness of the binder resulting in less deformation under heavy loading giving
an increase in resistance to rutting (Khattak et al 2013).
In many studies, raw montmorillonite nanoclay exhibits promising physical
properties that will enhance the ability of the asphalt mixture to withstand high
axle loads thus considerably reducing the depth of rutting and increasing the
performance of the pavement under repeated loading (Liu et al 2018). The
increased mechanical properties of asphalt mixtures modified with nanoclay can
also be attributed to improved adhesion of aggregates to the bitumen and their
improved stiffness and deformation resistance (Wu et al. 2020).
Overall, the addition of montmorillonite nanoclay into asphalt mixtures can be an
effective way to improve the ability of the asphalt mixture to withstand rutting
caused by axle loading therefore extending the lifespan of the pavement and
reducing maintenance costs.

1.4GEOGRAPHICAL SCOPE
The scope of this study was along the Mukono-Mbalala stretch along the Kampala-
Jinja highway



CHAPTER TWO: LITERATURE REVIEW.
2.1ROAD PAVEMENTS
A road pavement is a complex structure that consists of several overlapping layers
of engineered materials that are deposited over the underlying natural soil.
According to their statement, its primary role as presented by Tom and Rao (2007)
is to transfer the vehicle loads that are exerted on the surface to bottom subgrade in a regulated way. In the field of Highway engineering, there are two
common types of road pavements: flexible pavement and rigid pavement. Flexible
pavements are made of bituminous binders (that are usually referred to as asphalt
cement in North America) mixed with aggregates (Ridmika, 2019). Rigid
pavements, on the contrary, use Portland Cement Concrete as a major building
material.
2.1.1FLEXIBLE PAVEMENTS: CONSTRUCTION AND BEHAVIOUR.
In flexible pavements, they are meant to take these stresses that occur due to
loading of traffic through a stratified interior structure. The sequence normally
includes a surface course, base course, a sub-base and sub-grade with each layer
having a specific dissipation of load. The bituminous surface layer also has a
smooth, stable riding surface and the layers beneath the surface give resistance to
the deformation by interlocking together and also by the inherent stiffness of the
granular material (Zhang et al., 2023). The combination of the low flexural
strength of these constructions allows them to creep under load and,
consequently, relieve the peaks of stresses; they regain their elasticity when the
load is eliminated, which is explained by the viscoelastic characteristics of
bitumen (Khan et al., 2022). Therefore, pavements of this nature need to be
resistant to change of climatic conditions, temperature changes, and intrusion of
moisture that are some of the factors that hasten their degradation. Material
choice, therefore, does not only rely on the functional classification and the
intensity of traffic, but depends on the climatic aspect as well (Al‐Qadi and Wang,
2021). Sturdiness and maintenance in good time are essential in increasing service
life and achieving stability in performance.


2.1.2BITUMEN: CHARACTERISTICS, COMPOUNDS AND APPLICATIONS.
Asphalt, also known as bitumen in American colloquialism, is a petroleum byproduct or natural mineral, a visco-elastic hydrocarbon (Read and Whiteoak,
2003). Its behaviour under mechanical loading varies with temperature: at low
temperatures of loading and high frequency loading it acts like an elastic solid, and
at high temperatures and low loading rates like a viscous liquid (Anderson et al.,
2021). This duality demands the emergence of performance enhancing technology.
Low-temperature cracking and high-temperature rutting mitigation are of special
concern in the tropical climate, like in Uganda, where bitumen is used as the base
material in asphalt concrete (Obaid and Al-Mansob, 2022).
2.1.3CHEMICAL AND RHEOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS.
Bitumen is a complicated structure of hydrocarbons in the form of aliphatic,
alicyclic, and polyaromatic compounds, supplemented by heteroatoms (O, N, S)
and traces of metals (vanadium, nickel, and iron) (Lesueur, 2022). According to the
Nellensteyn model, this is a structure that is filled with asphaltene particles
dispersing in a resin-stabilised maltene (saturates and aromatics) matrix (Petersen,
2009). Important rheological characteristics such as viscosity, penetration,
softening point, and ductility have a direct effect on mixing, compaction, and
adhesion of aggregates (Airey, 2023). Lack of control in the viscosity may affect
aggregate coating, and a dynamic shear rheometer (DSR) test measures the viscoelastic reaction to applied simulated traffic conditions (Bahia et al., 2021).
2.2CHALLENGES AND INNOVATIONS
The world pavement industry is faced with the rising distresses of rutting and
cracking, partly due to the increased load on the traffic and extreme climatic
conditions (Zaumanis et al., 2023). The developing nations are often characterised
by poor maintenance regimes and thus enhance wear and tear faster resulting in
the need to use high-performance bitumen. Other advanced methods of analysis,
such as Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Gel Permeation
Chromatography (GPC), can give information about ageing processes and chemical
structure
(Yin
et
al.,
2021),
whereas
polymer
modifiers,
such
as
styrenebutadienestyrene (SBS) and crumb-rubber, can play an important role in
maximising elasticity and rut resistance (Polacco et al., 2022).


2.2.1TERMINOLOGY AND STANDARDS
According to the American Society of testing and materials (ASTM) D8, bitumen is a
carbon disulfide-soluble, hydrocarbon-based cementitious substance (ASTM, 2021).
In Uganda, the nomenclature is that bitumen (the binder) is differentiated with
asphalt, which is a composite product of bitumen and aggregates (UNRA, 2022).
2.2.2RUTTING OF ASPHALT PAVEMENTS: CAUSES, MECHANISM, AND RISKS.
Rutting should be regarded as a severe distress of pavements that are flexible as it
causes the decline in performance and poses a threat to the safety. The high truck
traffic, tyres pressure, and the growth of traffic quantities contribute to the
permanent deformation of asphalt layers in the form of longitudinal depressions
along the tracks of the wheels (Wang et al., 2023). Repeated loading of structures
with irreversible strain does not only undermine structural integrity but also
encourages pooling of water following which activities such as hydroplaning and
loss of traction become probable (Almeida et al., 2022).
2.2.2.1TYPES OF RUTTING
Rutting generally breaks off into two major types:
1. Subgrade Rutting - occurs when the underlying layers (sub -grade or
foundations) degenerate excessively, which is normally caused by inadequate
pavement depth or structural support. The form is more common in thin
pavements that have higher loads with the stresses induced by the load exceeding
the bearing capacity of the sub-grade (Zhou et al., 2021).
2. Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) Rutting: This phenomenon develops as a result of plastic
deformation of asphalt layer itself, and this may be due to poor mix design, break
even due to improper compaction or high-temperature susceptibility. It is in
contrast to subgrade rutting where HMA rutting may take place even with constant
underlying layers (Khan et al., 2023).
The current research focuses on the rutting of HMA, which is basically caused by
recurrent heavy axle weights, excessive pavement temperatures (lowening the
asphalt stiffness) and inadequate quality of binder or aggregates that causes poor
shear resistance. Highly developed tests of materials and refined mix designs,


including polymer-modified binders and high-performance aggregates, have been
found to be effective in rutting mitigation of HMA (Ghabchi et al., 2022).
2.2.2.2ASPHALT MIXTURES TESTING PROCEDURES: RUTTING.
Rutting resistance forms a crucial performance indicator of pavements made of
asphalt. To test this property, a number of standardised laboratory tests are used.
The most common methods are the following:
1. Asphalt Mixture Performance Tester (AMPT)
This apparatus measures rutting susceptibility in terms of flow number, which
represents the onset of the tertiary flow or permanent shear deformation and in
turn, the dynamic modulus; which is critical for mechanistic-empirical pavement
design (NCHRP, 2021). Request testing is done at repeated compressive loads
controlled at different temperatures.
2. For example: Scotland Burger Wheel Tracking Machine (HWTD).
By rolling a steel wheel over a specimen of asphalt submerged in water and water,
this device simulates the loading of traffic, so it evaluates the level of resistance
of moisture damage and rutting. Accelerated deformation in such a setup is an
indication of stripping susceptibility (AASHTO T 324, 2021). The device provides a
way to track the progression of depth of rut over thousands of cycles.
3. An initial step in prosecuting these firms was completed when the Asphalt
Pavement Analyzer (APA) discovered numerous plants applied a component
containing elevated tetane levels.<|human|>Asphalt Pavement Analyzer (APA) was
one of the first steps taken in piling up charges on these firms when the Asphalt
Pavement Analyzer (APA) test found more than a dozen of plants used a compound
with higher levels of tetane.
Utilising a loaded aluminium wheel during pressurised hose operation, the APA
simulates the traffic condition and determines the rut depth after a predetermined
number of cycles and thereby, provides a comparative assessment of the mix's
stability (West et al., 2022).


2.3NANOCLAYS: MATERIALS, PREPARATION AND USES.
Nanoclays are a class of nanomaterials of layered mineral silicates, with
dimensions capable of being less than 100 nm for each. Their exceptional
structures and physicochemical characteristics have received huge interests as
useful additives in polymer composites, green remedial efforts, biomedical
engineering, and energy storage (Giannakas et al., 2021). The high surface area,
exceptional aspect ratio, and tunable surface chemistry of them make them very
effective for improving the mechanical strength, thermal stability and barrier
properties of composite materials (Kausar, 2022).
2.3.1STRUCTURE AND COMPOSITION
Nanoclays consist of stacked layered units, which mostly consist of:
Tetrahexahedron shapes In this case, each tetrahedron uses 3 oxygen atoms that
have an oxygen atom with its neighbors, creating a two dimensional sheet.
Octahedral sheets (aluminium/magnesium- oxygen-hydroxyl = Al/MgO6) - these
sheets are covalently attached to tetrahedral layers hence forming a lamellar
structure (Bergaya & Lagaly, 2023).
This arrangement of these sheets defines the type of nanoclay (e.g.,
montmorillonite, kaolinite or halloysite), which in turn affects the properties such
as cation exchange capacity and swelling behaviour (Zhou et al.,oda, 2021).
These materials have been integrated to polymer nanocomposites where they are
used to enhance tensile strength, flame retardant and gas barrier properties (Kotal
& Bhowmick, 2021); used for environmental remediation due to their effectiveness
in adsorbing heavy metals and organic pollutants (Unuabonah & Taubert, 2022) in
wastewater; and have medical engineering applications such as drug delivery,
wound dressing and tissue scaffolds due to their biocompatibility (Gaharwar et al
2023).
2.3.2NANOCLAYS: TYPES, PROPERTIES AND CLASSIFICATION.
Nanoclays are classified into classes according to their electrochemical charge
property as anionic, neutral, and cationic, and are classified as follows because
they have different structural and functional properties: each class has unique
characteristics for a specific use.


A unique feature of anionic nanoclays, in particular of layered double hydroxides
(LDHs), is the presence of positively charged octahedral sheets containing divalent
(Mg, Zn) and trivalent (Al, Fe) metal cations with charge balancing anions (CO3^2-,
NO3-, Cl-) located in the interlayer space (Wang et al., 2021). These nanoclays
have excellent anion exchange capacity that make them valuable for
environmental remediation particularly for the removal of pollutants like
phosphate and arsenic from wastewater. The advantages of them are their thermal
stability and pH-responsiveness according to flame-retard polymer uses and
controlled drug delivery (Cao et al., 2022; Rives et al., 2023).
Kaolinites and talc are neutral nanoclays that are associated with either 1:1 or 2: 1
layer structures and weakly electrochemical charges. In the 1:1 configuration, one
tetrahedral (SiO4) sheet is bonded with a single octahedral (AlO6) sheet. 2:1
configuration is composed of two tetrahedral sheets sandwiching an octahedral
(MgO6) sheet (Murray, 2021). Owing to their low surface charge and low swelling
capacity, these nanoclays are chemically inert and hence employed in the
production of ceramics, paper coatings, as well as reinforcing fillers in polymers
composites where there is need for electrical neutrality (Bergaya et al., 2022).
Cationic nanoclays, as montmorillonite and vermiculite, for example, have a 2:1
layered structure with a permanent negative charge (0.2-2 per unit cell) due to
isomorphous substitutions in the tetrahedral sheets or in the octahedral sheets
(e.g. Al3+ for Si4+). This imbalance of charges is replaced by exchangeable cations
(Na+, Ca++, K+) in the interlayer space and gives these materials a high cation
exchange capacity. Such attributes make cationic nanoclays especially useful for
heavy metal adsorption in water treatment, as rheology modifiers in drilling fluids
and reinforcing agents in polymer nanocomposites to improve their barrier
properties in food packaging applications (Unuabonah et al., 2021; Giannakas
et al., 2022).
The unique properties of these nanoclay types ranging from anion exchange
capacity provided by LDHs up to the cation exchange capacity of smectites and
chemical inertness of kaolinites enable their use in various fields of applications
from environmental engineering through to materials science and biomedical
applications.

2.3.3MONTMORILLONITE
In Montmorillonite, the chemical composition divides nanoclay minerals (Smectite
Group) into two different categories based on their structure. The formula is Na,
Ca) 0.33 (Al, Mg) 2 (Si 4 O 10) (OH) 2.nH 2 O.Montmorillonite has a unique
combination of uses and properties due to its ability to hold cations, swell when
wet, and adsorb gases and pa flammables like mercury (Bergaya and Lagaly, 2013).
The montmorillonite mineral found in bentonite deposits is derived from the
weathering of volcanic ash and can be used as an additive in polymer composites
as a replacement for fiberglass to improve the strength of the products and
decrease the overall weight of these reinforced plastics. Because of its ability to
release water when heated, montmorillonite provides a flame-retardant feature in
plastics or coatings that would otherwise burn easily (Kotal and Bhowmick, 2015;
Leszczyńska et al., 2021).
Due to its significantly high surface area and Cation Exchange capacity (CEC),
montmorillonite can efficiently remove heavy metals and harmful organic
pollutants in the environment by sorbing them. Examples of how montmorillonite
can be used in agriculture include soil amendment and enhancing soil's ability to
retain moisture (Uddin, 2017). Additionally, montmorillonite can act as a catalyst
because of its unique ability to support other materials through ion exchange and
sol-gel preparation (Zango et al., 2022). Recent work has shown that
montmorillonite can enhance the performance of polymer nanocomposites by
improving their thermal stability, barrier properties and biodegradation


characteristics (Mallakpour et al., 2023), whilst Saba et al. (2021) have shown that
montmorillonite can also provide substantial benefits in the automotive and
aerospace sectors through the reduction in vehicle weight and improvement in
mechanical properties. The unique capabilities of montmorillonite make it a
revolutionary material in various construction, packaging and chemical industries,
with many ongoing research projects that are developing further applications for
montmorillonite using advanced modification techniques (Hussain et al., 2022).

CHAPTER THREE: METHODOLOGY
3.1MATERIAL SELECTION AND PREPARATION
3.1.1BITUMEN
The grade of bitumen that was used in this study was 60/70 due to its
thermoplastic property which causes the material to soften at high temperatures
and harden at lower temperatures and used in hot climates because due to its
durability against heavy traffic loads.
3.1.2AGGREGATES
Aggregates selected were the ones in the asphaltic concrete wearing course (AC
14). Indicating that the nominal size of aggregates is 14mm. Grading tests on
aggregates to ensure that the nominal size of aggregates is 14 mm with reference
to HMA 007-02. AC 14 was chosen to be used in asphalt because of its ability to
carry loads of up to 10,000 kgs, making it ideal for larger projects where durability
and strength are a priority. AC 14 has an excellent skid resistance. The
combination of the components in AC 14 creates a surface that is flexible enough
to allow for temperature fluctuations without cracking.
3.1.3ORGANOPHILIC MONTMORILLONITE
The OMMT was obtained in its readily modified form from the raw MMT into the
fine nano size OMMT from a certified supplier.
3.2To characterize the properties of organophilic Montimorillonite Nano Clay,
Bitumen, and Aggregate
3.2.1TEST ON ORGANOPHILIC MONTIMORILLONITE NANO CLAY
The OMMT clay was characterized for its hydrophilic surface properties, ability to
absorb and exchange cationic ions, and its reactivity to heat. In order to establish
the characteristics of organophilic Montimorillonite Nano clay, X-ray diffraction
(XRD) was conducted. This method is an analytical method that does not change
the surface of the material being investigated, and is used primarily to determine
the atomic and molecular structure of substances that are crystalline in form
(Cullity and Stock, 2001; Patterson et al., 2017).
The procedure followed to conduct X-ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis on Organophilic
Montmorillonite (MMT) Nano Clay;


1.
A nanoclay sample for XRD analysis was prepared by heating the nanoclay
sample into a fine powder, which will provide a random orientation of the
crystallites (Patterson et al., 2017) and prepared for inclusion in the sample
holder.
2.
Once placed into the sample holder, the sample holder was mounted to a
goniometer stage that was a part of the XRD instrument.
3.
Once the sample holder was mounted to the goniometer stage, the XRD
instrument consisted of an X-ray source, a sample holder, and a detector.
4.
The X-ray source emitted X-rays that passed through the sample holder,
which in turn created a series of diffraction patterns that were captured by a
detector (Cullity and Stock, 2001). The sample was exposed to X-rays for a
specified length of time as described by the capabilities of the XRD instrument.
In order to characterize the nanoclay's crystalline structure and phase composition,
diffracted X-rays were recorded and plotted as a function of the angle (2θ)
between the incident beam and the detector site. The resulting plot, intensity
versus 2θ, contains valuable information about the nanoclay's configuration, as
reported in Bergaya and Lagaly (2013). Subsequently, the intensity versus 2θ plots
were analysed using software programs, including either DIFFRAC.SUITE or
HighScore Plus (Bruker, 2021). At the conclusion of IDF and XRD analyses of the
sample nanoclay, the analyst can derive an estimate of the sample's crystallite
sizes and lattice parameters, as well as assess whether the sample contains any
impurities.
3.2.2CHARACTERISATION OF BITUMEN
The properties of bitumen were obtained through, the penetration test (ASTM D5-
86), softening point (ASTM D36-70), viscosity (ASTM D2170).
3.2.2.1THE PENETRATION TEST ASTM D5-86.
The Penetration Test consists of a standardized experiment to determine how deep
a weighted (50 g) tapered needle, placed vertically above the sample in a
temperature-controlled environment at 25°C, will penetrate into the sample
during five seconds of exposure to the temperature. A high penetration rate


indicates that the sample is soft; conversely, a low penetration rate indicates that
the sample is relatively hardness.
3.2.2.2SOFTENING POINT TEST. ASTM D 36
Softening point is the temperature at which bitumen attains a particular degree of
softening under specified conditions of the test. This helps in classifying bitumen,
evaluating tendency of the material to flow at elevated temperatures encountered
in service.
3.2.2.3SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF BITUMEN. ASTM D-70.
The specific gravity is integral in determining the appropriate bitumen grade for
asphalt mix designs, influencing the selection of penetration or viscosity grades
and also plays a crucial role in calculating volume-correction factors, ensuring
accurate volume measurements in mix designs. The specific gravity establishes
compatibility between bitumen and aggregates, influencing coating, adhesion, and
overall performance of the asphalt mixture.
3.2.3TESTING ON AGGREGATES
Aggregates were evaluated using the following techniques: BS 812-P103-1 (Sieve),
BS 812-112 (Impact), and BS 812-113 (Abrasion).
3.2.3.1SIEVE AND GRADING TESTS, BS 812-P103-1:
Sieve and grading tests are used to classify different types of aggregates based on
particle size. From this information, the predominant aggregate will be
determined, i.e. gravel, sand, silt, clay; the degree to which each of the four
groups contributes to the aggregate's mechanical properties can be estimated.
3.2.3.2AGGREGATE CRUSHING VALUE BS 812: PART 110: 1990:
The strength of aggregates can be determined by performing the Aggregate
Crushing Value (ACV) test. An aggregate's ACV indicates how resistant it will be to
crushing under an increasing load; the ACV is determined by taking a sample from
the crushed material and passing it through a specified size sieve with 400 kN.
3.2.3.3LOS ANGELES ABRASION TEST - ASTM C 131-89:
Repeated loading on pavement by vehicles exhibits a wear effect on stones on the
pavement surface. Hence the most important physical property to consider is the
resistance to wear, (sometimes referred to as hardness), of the aggregate when


used in the wear course of asphalt pavements. Performance of this test allows for
the evaluation of mineral aggregate degradation due to combined actions of
abrasion.
3.2.3.4SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF AGGREGATES ACCORDING TO BS812 PART 2: 1975
This test used to calculate the volumetric properties of an asphalt mix. This
includes air voids, VMA (voids in mineral aggregate) and VFA (voids filled with
asphalt).
3.2.3.5THE AGGREGATE IMPACT VALUE, AS DESCRIBED IN BS812 PART 112:
1990.
This test is an indicator of how resistant aggregate is to sudden shock or impact.
Road-building aggregates must have sufficient strength to support the loads placed
on them by the wheels of vehicles travelling over them.
3.3To determine the optimum organophilic MMT Nano clay content to be used in
the mix
To identify how much organophilic MMT nano clay to use in a mix the following
tests were conducted. Samples of asphalt with different amounts of bitumen were
made and compacted. Each of these asphalt mixes were tested for ; stability
(ASTM D6927), flow (ASTM D6927), Bulk density (ASTM D2726), air voids, and VMA
(ASTM D2041) per sample. The bitumen content yielding the best combination of
performance were taken as the optimum bitumen content used in that particular
sample.
A systematic testing procedure was used to determine the maximum percentage of
organophilic montmorillonite nano clay to add to asphalt mixes. The aim is to
determine the percentage of OMMT nano clay that enhances the performance of
the bitumen.
Preparation of Samples
•
Sample asphalt mixtures containing various percentages of OMMT Nanoclay
0%, 0.5%, 1% and 1.5% by weight of of the total mix.
•
. For each OMMT percentage, 392 g of 60/70 penetration grade bitumen
which is 4.9% of the total 8,000g mix was heated to between 150°C and 160°C and
rotation of 3000rpm for 20-30 minutes to enable adequate mixing.


•
Asphalt samples were then compacted using marshall compactors; (ASTM-D
6926).
2. Key Tests Used to Evaluate Performance
The additional tests that were performed on each compacted asphalt sample, were
used to determine the optimum level of OMMT Nanoclay content;
3.3.1MARSHALL STABILITY AND FLOW TEST (ASTM-D 6927)
The Marshall Stability and Flow Test measured the compressive strength of an
asphalt mixture and represented its resistance to deformation under load. In the
Marshall Stability Test, 60 degrees celcius is applied as the temperature under
simulated high temperature pavement conditions, and a consistent loading rate of
50.8 mm/min up to failure is used to perform the Marshall Stability Test. The test
yielded two parameters, the Marshall Stability (in Kilo-Newtons) as well as the
Marshall Flow (in mm). The higher the representative Marshall Stability is, the
more rut resistant the asphalt is expected to be. The representative flow should
ideally be between 2-4 mm, which indicates a balance between Stiffness and
Flexibility, to avoid excessive brittleness or deformation of the product.
3.3.2BULK SPECIFIC GRAVITY & DENSITY (ASTM D2726)
The test conducted under ASTM D2726 proves the existence of a compatibility and
voids within an asphalt mixture. The process of weighing a sample in both air and
in water under saturated surface-dry provides the bulk specific gravity of the
asphalt concrete or Gmb. A higher value of Gmb signifies that there is greater
compaction and less voids filled with air, which also promotes higher durability and
provides greater resistance to moisture entering the material. Proper compaction
allows for the mix to be able to withstand the stresses of traffic without
experiencing excessive deformation.
3.3.3AIR VOIDS (AV) & VOIDS IN MINERAL AGGREGATE (VMA) (ASTM D3203 /
D2041)
The voids within an asphalt mixture are a vital part of the overall durability and
resistance to moisture damage. The Void in Mineral Aggregate test and Air Voids
test are performed per ASTM D3203 and ASTM D2041 respectively. The Air Voids
(AV) are the percentage difference between the theoretical maximum density and
the bulk density and should be in the range of 3 – 5 %. Too few air voids will cause


rutting and too many will create a situation where moisture will penetrate the
material. The VMA (Voids in Mineral Aggregate) test determines the amount of void
space between aggregates and is filled with binder and air. The VMA should be at
least 14% to be considered sufficient to coat the aggregates with binder to prevent
premature cracking and stripping.
3.3.4DETERMINING OPTIMAL OMMT CONTENT TO BE ADDED.
The amount of OMMT in Bitumen was determined to be suitable based on the
results from testing of samples with varying levels of MMT. The best type of OMMT
mixture had;
1. Highest Marshall Stability within the specified standards indicating that the
sample has the ability to resist excessive amounts of rutting.
2. A Flow value between 2-4 mm. This indicated that there is enough flexibility in
the sample while also providing adequate resistance to deformities when placed
under traffic loads.
3. An Air Voids percentage of 3-5% and VMA percentage of >= 14% to meet the
require value necessary for long-term performance.
4. Highest ITS and TSR strengths represented superior cracking and moisture
resistances of samples containing OMMT.

3.4To determine the mechanical properties and rutting resistance of Organophilic
Montmorillonite nanoclay modified bitumen.

3.4.1THE INDIRECT TENSILE STRENGTH (ITS) TEST (ASTM D6931)
This test provided information on a mixture's ability to resist crack formation and
indicated moisture effects on the sample through the application of a diametrical
tensile load until failing to measure the ITS value of the sample to show the degree
of tensile resistance capacity of the mixture.
The ITS (Indirect Tensile Strength) value is an indicator of how well an asphalt
mixture can resist thermal and fatigue cracks. A higher ITS value indicated that a
mixture was more resistant to cracking due to either heat or fatigue.


3.4.2MOISTURE SUSCEPTIBILITY (AASHTO T 283 / ASTM D4867)
The Moisture Damage Test also known as the TSR test was used to measure the
effect of moisture on the Tensile Strength Ratio (or TSR) of a modified asphalt
mixture. It involved subjecting prepared sample pieces of the mixture to freezethaw cycles before analyzing their indirect tensile strength (ITS). In this test, the
minimum prescribed TSR value is 80%.
The combined effect of both these tests indicated that when modified with
nanoclay, the mixture was able to maintain sufficient tensile strength even after
exposure to water. In addition, because of their unique chemistry, nanoclays tend
to enhance the performance of the variants used for asphalt cement's adhesion to
treated aggregates while also improving the ability of those aggregates to drain
away moisture efficiently.
Asphalt mixtures made with Nano Clay were tested to determine if it is effectively
utilized to increase their performance for “Rutting Resistance” (Permanent
Deformation) & “Stripping Resistance” (Water Damage). Standard tests were
utilized to evaluate Asphalt Mixtures. Following are summaries of some of the
various types of tests and testing procedures:
3.4.3WHEEL TRACKING TEST (EN 12697-22/AASHTO T 324/ASTM D 7064)
The Wheel Tracking test (WTT) was developed to determine the amount of vertical
deflection of the Surface of Asphalt Specimens caused by the repeated application
of Load, in conjunction with the simulation of real-world traffic conditions, to
evaluate the amount of Rutting (Vertical Deformation) of the Specimen being
tested. During the test, a Load Wheel is rolled across a Compacted Slab of Asphalt
or a Cylindrical Sample held at a controlled Temperature (50-60°C) to determine
the Rutting Depth of the asphalt material. The WTT test consists of numerous
Repetitive cycles, and the Data collected during the WTT test is utilized to
determine the Rate at which Ruts will form, thereby providing an estimate of the
Rut Resistance of the asphalt mixture being evaluated. Generally, mixtures that
are modified with Nano Clay demonstrate reduced Rut Depths attributed to the
increase in stiffness and stability of the Binder material.




CHAPTER FOUR: RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
4.1 Introduction
The results from this study, presented in this chapter, show how various tests were
completed for objectives one through three and the outcome associated with
them. The goal of objective one was to determine the characteristics of
organophilic montmorillonite, bitumen, and aggregate materials; therefore, tests
were performed on these materials using different test methods including: X-Ray
diffraction, aggregate crushing, aggregate impact, ten percent fines, flakiness
index and grading for aggregate testing and softening point, penetration, flash
point and specific gravity for testing of bitumen material.
4.2PROPERTIES OF BITUMEN
TABLE 1PROPERTIES OF BITUMEN

The table above shows a summary of results obtained from tests done which
include; Softening Point, Penetration, Specific Gravity for bitumen compared to
the standards and are explained below;
4.2.1PENETRATION OF BITUMEN
Test results from the penetration test reveal that the average (0.1 mm)
penetration value of this research's bitumen (60/70) is 68 and indicating that it is
located within the British Standard's specification of 60–70. The individual readings
of the penetration test show little variation from each other, indicating that the


produced bitumen is a uniform and stable binder. Furthermore, the results show
that the penetration value of the binder is close to the upper limit of the
specification and is indicative of its ability to maintain a moderate degree of
softness (at 25°C) for use during the mixing and compaction process while also
offering adequate adhesion properties between the aggregates. In general, this is
typical of binders used in tropical regions where binders must be flexible enough
to accommodate low-temperature fluctuations throughout the day (Read and
Whiteoak 2003).

4..2.2BITUMEN SOFTENING POINT TEST
This involves the determination of the semi-solid-to-fluid temperature of bitumen
after heating, under controlled conditions. The average softening point was
determined from the softening point of two rings (Ring-and-Ball). Ring 1 softened
to 53°C; Ring 2 softened to 54°C. The average softening point was 53.5°C. This
softening point was very much in line with the temperature range for bitumen with
a penetration grade of 60/70 (49-56°C) as outlined by British Standards (BS 2000,
2003). The close agreement of both ring results indicated good thermal uniformity
and consistency between the binder samples, thus indicating that prior to the
softening point determination there was no indication that the binder had
experienced significant oxidation and/or contamination.Softening point results
indicate that the binder is relatively stiff under moderately high pavement
temperatures. As such, a higher softening point in hotter climates is preferred to


assist in limiting the asphalt's potential for excessive flow or rutting under higher
temperatures (Huang, 2012).

4.2.3BITUMEN SPECIFIC GRAVITY
Bitumen specific gravity testing provided a Specific Gravity of 1.025. This value
falls within the British Standards minimum to maximum limit of 1.01 - 1.06. A high
specific gravity indicates that the bitumen has a suitable density relative to the
water and will have good quality and refined properties. Additionally, the specific
gravity of an asphalt mix is important as it will have an impact on the volumetric
design, binder content determination, and mixture stability (Huang, 2012). A
Specific Gravity of approximately 1.02 indicates that the bitumen has not been
subjected to too much dilution of the lighter fractions or too much aging and
therefore both of these factors will greatly affect its performance. The specific
gravity value obtained from this study fit well within the expected specification
limits, indicating that the binder used in this research study is viable for producing
dense, well-compacted asphalt concrete.





4.3PROPERTIES OF AGGREGATES
Table 4 PROPERTIES OF AGGREGATES

The table above shows a summary of results obtained from tests done which
include; Aggregate Crushing Value, Aggregate Impact Value, Ten Percent Fines
Value, Flakiness Index and Grading for aggregates compared to the standards and
are explained below;
4.3.1GRADATION OF AGGREGATES
Gradation analysis was performed to evaluate if the combined aggregates are
within the recommended range of particle sizes for asphalt concrete
manufacturing. The blended final gradation corresponds closely with the target
gradation envelope showing an excellent balance of coarse aggregate/fine
aggregate/mineral filler elements.
From the larger sieve sizes (20 mm and 14 mm), the percentage that passed
through falls into the acceptable specification limits indicating that there is
sufficient quantity and coarsening of the coarse aggregates. The intermediate
sieve sizes (10 mm, 5 mm, and 2.36 mm) showed that the gradation remains
consistent with the target curve displaying a gradual progression of particle size.


This gradation consistency ensures that the aggregate particles lock together
properly providing for greater strength and stability.
Regarding the finer fractions of aggregate, (0.6 mm, 0.3 mm, and 0.075
mm sieve sizes) the amount of retained material is within the
recommended limits. The fine aggregate content is below the maximum
limit which indicates the asphalt concrete is unlikely to have excessive
demand for a binder, inadequate stability, or poor moisture resistance. At
the same time, there were sufficient fines present to fill voids and promote
a dense, well-graded structure.

4.3.2AGGREGATE CRUSHING VALUE (ACV)
Aggregate crushing value is an indicator of the aggregate's ability to withstand
pressure as it is a measure of how much an aggregate can tolerate compressive
loads without collapsing. As the test progresses, an aggregate sample is
progressively loaded until it breaks. After the sample has broken, the total amount
of fines produced is measured. The testing method conforms to the requirements
set forth in BS 812 Part 111:1990. An aggregate crushing value of 15.8%, which is
lower than the specified limit, indicated that the aggregates can withstand gradual
loading with minimal breakage. Therefore, there will be fewer fines produced
during construction, impacting the pavement's durability. Furthermore, fewer fines
will be produced during Marshall compaction testing, which may adversely affect
the mix design by altering the stability and volumetric properties of the mix.
Aggregates with lower aggregate crushing values produce stronger aggregates.

4.3.3AGGREGATE IMPACT VALUE (AIV)
The 15.0% Aggregate Impact Value exceeded the target and indicated that the
aggregates have enough strength to withstand shock due to sudden impact. So,
there will likely be fewer fine particles produced that could affect the long-term
durability of the roadway. There will also likely be fewer fine particles formed
when conducting Marshall Compaction tests that could negatively impact both
stability as well as volumetric properties of the mix, resulting in an inaccurate mix
design. The lower the Aggregate Impact Value, the greater the aggregate's
resistance to impact.

The expected value of the aggregate impact value (AIV) was calculated using the
average of approximately fifteen percent average loss of all samples, which is
significantly lower than the maximum allowed under British Standards of 30% for
aggregate used to make up asphalt concrete. The low values of AIV exhibited by
the tested materials indicate that the materials are tough and can withstand
sudden shocks and impact loads. The very small difference in aggregate impact
value between the two representative samples further reinforces the general
quality consistency of the material. Therefore, aggregates have sufficient
strengths to support the dynamic loads that pavements are subjected to.
4.3.4SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF AGGREGATES
The specific gravity of coarse aggregate particles used in the asphalt concrete mix
was determined through a laboratory-based procedure. The results indicated that
the bulk specific gravity of the coarse aggregates was 2.621, and it was also
determined that the apparent specific gravity of the coarse aggregates was 2.638.
Therefore, the SSD basis for this aggregate was determined to be 2.627, and the
measured water absorption rate of 0.2% indicates that these aggregate particles
possess a dense structure with very few intern particles about them, which provide
better protection from continued crushing and wear from traffic loads than do the
more porous aggregates.

<2%

The measured water absorption value of 0.2% indicated that this aggregate has a
low level of porosity and is, therefore, unlikely to absorb water. BS 812: Part 2
(1995) states that aggregates that absorb less than 1% by dry weight of water are
classified as high-quality materials and that a high rate of water absorption can
result in a poor bond with bitumen and early failure from stripping due to water
(Roberts et al., 1996). Therefore, these aggregates provide an excellent
combination of durability and moisture resistance needed to maintain long-term
pavement stability.
The amount of water that can be absorbed from the binder of the aggregates and
the amount of aggregate that is present in the asphalt concrete will affect its
performance. The values of water absorption refer to the total number of
aggregate particles that have been in contact with water. The values should not
exceed 2% of the weight of the aggregate for the purpose of using them in asphalt
concrete surfacing. Therefore, the aggregates tested are acceptable for use based
upon their specific gravity and water absorption.
According to standard BS 812:105, aggregates, which contain more than 25% flaky
or elongated particles, should not be used as coarse aggregates. The coarse
aggregates t contained less than 19.40%, flaky or elongated particles hence are
more efficient and desirable for use in asphalt concrete surfacing. This means that
the aggregates are more angular in shape, allowing for more interlocking to occur
between the aggregates, providing better stability and volumetric properties to
the asphalt concrete.
4.3.5TEN PERCENT FINES VALUE (TFV)
It is preferable for aggregates to have a high "Ten Percent Fines Value," (TFV)
because this indicates that they are highly resistant to crushing, which positively
contributes to the quality, durability, and performance of the asphalt concrete.
For both the dry and wet conditions, tested aggregates had a TFV of greater than


110 kN, which is the minimum recommended ten percent fine value for asphalt
concrete.
The High 10% Fines Value of the aggregates is preferred because that number
indicates how much the aggregate can withstand compression forces (crushed).
Aggregates that are strong enough to carry the weight of the asphalt will produce a
more robust and durable overall mixture of materials to withstand traffic loads.
The results for both dry and soaked conditions have been included in Tables 9 and
10, respectively.

Dry and saturated revisit obtained TFV more than 110kN, which is the minimum
value for aggregates used in asphalt concrete surfacing. In fact, that the W/D
strength ratio for the aggregate in table 11 exceeds the recommended value of 75%
set out by the British standards indicates that the aggregates still retain
substantial strength when subjected to moisture / saturation and therefore will be
able to withstand crushing under traffic loading (MoWHC, 2005).

4.3.6LOS ANGELES ABRASION TEST (LAA)
The Los Angeles Abrasion test has evaluated an aggregate's susceptibility to wear,
breakdown, or overall abrasion due to the stresses caused by the passage of
traffic. The average abrasion value obtained was 16.8% which is much lower than
the specified UK maximum of 40% laid out in ASTM C131 and BS 812-11:1990 and
therefore confirms that these aggregates have an excellent level of toughness and
resistance to mechanical degradation and will be able to meet the demands of
heavy pavement applications. Additionally, the fact that these aggregates have
such a low abrasion value will help assure users that they will remain intact during
the mixing, compaction, and traffic loading processes that occur while vibrating in


traffic. This will assist in maintaining the structural stability of the asphalt mixture
being formed. (Huang, 2012; Kadiyali & Lal, 2016).

The data supports the conclusion that the Mukono Quarry's aggregate material has

and, therefore, overall performance, when used in an OMMT-modified asphalt
concrete mixture.










4.4Organophilic Montmorillonite nano clay Xray diffractometry


Figure 4 XRAY-DIFFRACTOMETRY OF ORGANOPHILIC MONTMORILLONITE
X-ray diffraction patterns for organophilic montmorillonite illustrate the
diffraction patterns associated with montmorillonite. The d-spacings for
montmorillonite are represented by distinct peaks at particular 2 theta angles.
Montmorillonite has a basal spacing peak at d001, which is a characteristic feature
of montmorillonite. The angle and intensity of the d001 peak provide information
about interlayer spacing and about montmorillonite dispersion and intercalation in
polymers and asphalt. X-ray diffraction patterns support the idea that
montmorillonite
has
a
crystalline
structure.


If montmorillonite is effectively dispersed and intercalated into asphalt, it is likely to
enhance the rutting resistance of the asphalt by changing the viscoelastic properties
of the asphalt.
Montmorillonite (D001) is a common component of clays and can be identified by its
characteristic 5 to 10° 2θ peak, which corresponds to d-spacings of 1 to 1.8 nm. The
sharpness of the peaks may indicate the presence of well-ordered or aggregated
structures, whereas broad peaks or shifts may indicate intercalation with mixtures of
aspahlt, or partial peeling apart of clay layers.

4.5ASPHALT MARSHALL SAMPLE TESTS
4.5.1MAXIMUM THEORETICAL SPECIFIC GRAVITY (GMM) AND BULK SPECIFIC
GRAVITY (GMB)
The Maximum Theoretical Specific Gravity (Gmm) Test provides the specific gravity
of an asphalitic mixture without taking into account air voids. Gmm allows us to
calculate compaction levels and the volumetric characteristics of the asphalt mixture.
The bulk specific gravity test (Gmb) provides the specific gravity of the compacted
asphalt sample, factoring in the air voids. Both Gmm and Gmb Values provide the
framework for calculating air voids for assessing mixture durability and resistance to
permanent deformation due to loading from vehicles (Roberts et al., 1996).

As shown by the Experimental Results, the Gmm values produced by Method 3
discarded a slight decrease in value from 2.450 at 0% OMMT to 2.437 at 1.0% OMMT,
while 2.438 was produced as the Gmm value for 1.5% OMMT. However, the Gmb
values produced with Method 3 showed a general increase from 2.342 to a peak of
2.352 at 1.0% OMMT, followed by a drop in value to 2.322 at 1.5% OMMT. The increase
in Gmb produced with 1.0% OMMT may be an indicator of improved compaction and
better densification of the mixture and have significant positive correlation with
resistance to temporary deformations (i.e., rutting). The addition of OMMT to the mix
increased the overall density of the mix and provided an increase in the bond strength
between aggregate particles, both of which contribute to the reduced susceptibility
to temporary deformations (Brown & Cross, 1992).
There are several factors that may account for the slight decrease in Gmm values and
the increase in Gmb values until the addition of 1.0% OMMT occurred. These factors
include improved binder stiffness and enhanced dispersion of nano clay within the
bitumen matrix, which allows for greater packing density. However, the addition of
1.5% OMMT in this instance may have caused excessive clay content, which has been
shown to lead to slight agglomeration of particles and excessive stiffness. This may
have resulted in less effective compaction of the mixture, thus providing an
explanation for the drop in Gmb values produced. Similar trends in performing
workability and compaction studies with nano-modified binders have been noted in
past research (Chen et al., 2011), thus supporting the concept that an excessive use
of modifiers may have a negative effect on both workability and compaction ability of
the mixture.



4.5.2MARSHALL STABILITY
The Marshall Stability Test measures the maximum amount of loads that an asphalt
sample can withstand when compressed. It is a measure of how well an asphalt
material resists plastic deformation when subjected to heavy or constant movement
(over time) from motor vehicle traffic. In addition to this, higher "stability" indicates a
more stable structure and as a result has improved "rutting" characteristics (Huang,
2012).

Figure 5 MARSHALL STABILITY OF OMMT SAMPLES

Results indicated a steady increase from 13.4kN (0% OMMT) to 17.2kN (1.0%
OMMT) and peaking at 19.0kN (1.5% OMMT). All values fall within the ASTM
range of 8–18kN except the highest value, which slightly exceeds the upper

limit. While the highest stability at 1.5% suggests robust resistance to
deformation, the value at 1.0% provides a more appropriate balance between
strength and flexibility, aligning with design specifications. Increased stability
with rising OMMT content arises from improved rigidity and reinforcement of
the binder phase, enhancing aggregate bonding and shear resistance.
However, excessively high stability may indicate reduced flexibility, which
could lead to cracking, especially under repeated loading (Khattak et al.,
2013).

4.5.3MARSHALL FLOW
The amount of deformation and the amount of stress that the material can take
before cracking is measured by Marshall Flow. The amount of stress the material can
take without cracking must be between two and four millimetres according to ASTM
specifications. When a mix has this amount of stress without excessive deformation, it
indicates that the material is suitable for use in practice (Read & Whiteoak 2003). The
suitability of a mix for use in practice is defined as being within ASTM specifications,
which is between eight and eighteen kilonewtons for all but the highest values that
are exceeding the upper limit. The highest stability of the material occurs at 1.5%
OMMT (a minimum of one) and indicates that the material can withstand large
amounts of deformation. Conversely, the mix that contains one per cent OMMT
indicates a greater balance between strength and flexibility, which is what the design
requires. As a mix has increased OMMT and binder, the increased rigidity and
reinforcement in the binder have enhanced the bond between the aggregate and the
shear resistance of the aggregate. However, excessive amounts of stability may result
in loss of flexibility, which can result in cracking under repetitive loading (Khattak et
al. 2013).



Figure 6 MARSHALL FLOW OF OMMT SAMPLES
The flow value of the 0% OMMT was 3.0 mm, while it was 3.6 mm at 1% and 3.5 mm at
1.5% OMMT. All of these values are considered to be within acceptable limits. The
increased flow value at the 1% level indicates a good balance between the stiffness
and deformability of the asphalt mixture. When OMMT content is increased, the
viscosity and stiffness of the binder increase. However, the increase in structural
cohesion produced by the OMMT also allows for a controlled amount of deformation of
the mixture when loaded.
